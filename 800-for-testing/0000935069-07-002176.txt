                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The  Gabelli  Dividend  &  Income  Trust  (the  "Fund")  is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware
statutory trust on November 18, 2003 and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940,  as amended (the "1940 Act").  Investment  operations  commenced on
November 28, 2003.

     The Fund's investment  objective is to provide a high level of total return
on its assets with an emphasis on dividends and income. The Fund will attempt to
achieve its investment  objective by investing,  under normal market conditions,
at least 80% of its assets in  dividend  paying  securities  (such as common and
preferred stock) or other income producing securities (such as fixed income debt
securities and securities that are convertible into equity securities).

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting  principles
requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those  estimates.  The  following  is a summary of  significant  accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good  faith to reflect  its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on a foreign  market are generally
valued at the  preceding  closing  values  of such  securities  on the  relevant
market,  but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures  established by the Board
if market conditions change  significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the  securities  are being valued.
Debt  instruments  with  remaining  maturities  of 60 days or less  that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost,  unless the Board  determines such
amount  does not  reflect  the  securities'  fair  value,  in which  case  these
securities  will be fair valued as  determined  by the Board.  Debt  instruments
having a maturity  greater than 60 days for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked  prices  quoted  on such day,  the  security  is valued  using the
closing bid price.  Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Board.  Fair  valuation  methodologies  and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial  information  about the company;  comparisons to the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign  securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value ADR securities at the
close of the U.S.  exchange;  and evaluation of any other information that could
be indicative of the value of the security.

     In September  2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (the "FASB")
issued  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS")  157, Fair Value
Measurements,  which  clarifies  the  definition  of  fair  value  and  requires
companies  to expand  their  disclosure  about the use of fair  value to measure
assets and  liabilities  in interim  and annual  periods  subsequent  to initial
recognition.  Adoption of SFAS 157  requires  the use of the price that would be
received  to sell  an  asset  or paid to  transfer  a  liability  in an  orderly
transaction  between market  participants at the  measurement  date. SFAS 157 is
effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after
November 15, 2007, and interim

periods within those fiscal years. At this time, management is in the process of
reviewing the requirements of SFAS 157 against its current valuation policies to
determine future applicability.

     REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.  The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with  member  banks of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  or with other  brokers or
dealers that meet credit  guidelines  established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Fund takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Fund to resell,  the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby  determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain  securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount  invested by the Fund in each  agreement.  The Fund will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited. At June 30,
2007, the Fund had investments of $110,919,000 in repurchase agreements.

     OPTIONS.  The Fund may purchase or write call or put options on  securities
or  indices.  As a writer of put  options,  the Fund  receives  a premium at the
outset  and then  bears  the risk of  unfavorable  changes  in the  price of the
financial  instrument  underlying the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the
price of the  underlying  financial  instrument  decreases  between the date the
option is written and the date on which the option is terminated. The Fund would
realize a gain,  to the  extent of the  premium,  if the price of the  financial
instrument increases between those dates.

     As a  purchaser  of put  options,  the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put  option the  underlying  security  at a  specified
price.  The seller of the put has the  obligation  to  purchase  the  underlying
security upon  exercise at the exercise  price.  If the price of the  underlying
security declines,  the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or exercise.  If the
price of the  underlying  security  increases or stays the same,  the Fund would
realize a loss upon sale or at  expiration  date,  but only to the extent of the
premium paid.

     In the case of call  options,  these  exercise  prices are  referred  to as
"in-the-money,"  "at-the-money," and "out-of-the-money,"  respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying  security will remain stable or decline  moderately during the
option period,  (b) covered  at-the-money  call options when the Adviser expects
that the  price  of the  underlying  security  will  remain  stable  or  advance
moderately during the option period, and (c) out-of-the-money  call options when
the Adviser expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will
be greater than the  appreciation in the price of the underlying  security above
the exercise price. By writing a call option, the Fund limits its opportunity to
profit from any increase in the market value of the  underlying  security  above
the  exercise  price  of  the  option.   Out-of-the-money,   at-the-money,   and
in-the-money  put options  (the  reverse of call  options as to the  relation of
exercise price to market price) may be utilized in the same market  environments
that such call options are used in  equivalent  transactions.  At June 30, 2007,
the Fund had no investments in options.

     SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The  Fund  may  enter  into  interest  rate  swap or cap
transactions.  The use of swaps and caps is a highly  specialized  activity that
involves  investment  techniques and risks different from those  associated with
ordinary  portfolio  transactions.  Swap  agreements  may  involve,  to  varying
degrees,  elements  of market and  counterparty  risk,  and  exposure to loss in
excess  of  the  related  amounts  reflected  in the  Statement  of  Assets  and
Liabilities.  In an interest rate swap, the Fund would agree to pay to the other
party to the interest rate swap (which is known as the "counterparty")

periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the  counterparty  agreeing to
pay to the Fund  periodically  a  variable  rate  payment  that is  intended  to
approximate  the Fund's  variable rate payment  obligation on Series B Preferred
Stock. In an interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium to the counterparty
and, to the extent that a specified  variable rate index exceeds a predetermined
fixed rate,  would  receive from that  counterparty  payments of the  difference
based  on  the  notional  amount  of  such  cap.  Interest  rate  swap  and  cap
transactions  introduce  additional risk because the Fund would remain obligated
to pay  preferred  stock  dividends  when due in  accordance  with the  Articles
Supplementary even if the counterparty defaulted.

     The Fund has entered into an interest  rate swap  agreement  with  Citibank
N.A.  Under the agreement the Fund receives a floating rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at June 30, 2007 are as follows:

     The Fund may enter into equity swap  transactions.  The use of equity swaps
is a highly specialized  activity that involves investment  techniques and risks
different from those associated with ordinary portfolio  security  transactions.
In an  equity  swap,  a set of  future  cash  flows are  exchanged  between  two
counterparties.  One of these cash flow  streams  will  typically  be based on a
reference  interest rate combined with the  performance  of a notional  value of
shares of a stock. The other will be based on the performance of the shares of a
stock.

     The  Fund has  entered  into  equity  swap  agreements  with  Bear, Stearns
International Limited.  Details of  the swaps  at  June 30, 2007 are as follows:

</TABLE>
     If there is a default by the counterparty to a swap contract, the Fund will
be limited to contractual  remedies  pursuant to the  agreements  related to the
transaction. There is no assurance that the swap contract counterparties will be
able to meet their obligations pursuant to a swap contract or that, in the event
of default,  the Fund will succeed in pursuing  contractual  remedies.  The Fund
thus  assumes  the risk that it may be delayed in or  prevented  from  obtaining
payments owed to it pursuant to a swap  contract.  The  creditworthiness  of the
swap  contract  counterparties  is closely  monitored in order to minimize  this
risk.  Depending  on the  general  state of  short-term  interest  rates and the
returns on the Fund's portfolio securities at that point in time, such a default
could  negatively  affect  the  Fund's  ability to make  dividend  payments.  In
addition, at the time an equity swap or an interest rate swap or cap transaction
reaches its scheduled  termination  date, there is a risk that the Fund will not
be able to obtain a replacement transaction or that the terms of the replacement
will not be as  favorable  as on the expiring  transaction.  If this occurs,  it
could have a negative impact on the Fund's ability to make dividend payments.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market and counterparty risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities.

     Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and  unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest  to be paid or received on swaps are  reported as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

     FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose
of hedging against  changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and in the
value of  securities  it  intends  to  purchase.  Upon  entering  into a futures
contract,  the Fund is required to deposit  with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuations  in the
value    of    the    contract,     which    are    included    in    unrealized
appreciation/depreciation   on  investments  and  futures  contracts.  The  Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures  contracts as
a  hedging  instrument.  The  change  in value of  futures  contracts  primarily
corresponds  with the  value  of their  underlying  instruments,  which  may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter  into a  closing  transaction
because of an illiquid  secondary  market.  At June 30, 2007, there were no open
futures contracts.

     SECURITIES  SOLD  SHORT.  The Fund may enter into short sale  transactions.
Short selling involves  selling  securities that may or may not be owned and, at
times,  borrowing the same  securities  for delivery to the  purchaser,  with an
obligation  to replace such borrowed  securities  at a later date.  The proceeds
received  from short sales are recorded as  liabilities  and the Fund records an
unrealized  gain or loss to the extent of the  difference  between the  proceeds
received  and the value of an open short  position on the day of  determination.
The Fund records a realized gain or loss when the short  position is closed out.
By entering into a short sale,  the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable
change in the price of the  security  sold short.  Dividends  on short sales are
recorded as an expense by the Fund on the ex-dividend  date and interest expense
is  recorded on the accrual  basis.  Securities  sold short at June 30, 2007 are
reported within the Schedule of Investments.

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS.  The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the  transaction is denominated or another  currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward  rate and are  marked-to-market  daily.  The  change in market  value is
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the  difference  between the value of the  contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

     The  use  of  forward  foreign   exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does  establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future.  Although
forward  foreign  exchange  contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the  counterparties  to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their  contracts.  At June 30, 2007, there were no open forward foreign
exchange contracts.

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The  books  and  records  of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars.  Foreign currencies,  investments,  and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S.  dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,   income,  and  expenses  are
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective  dates

                                       16

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

of such  transactions.  Unrealized  gains and losses that result from changes in
foreign  exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities  have been
included in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and foreign
currency translations.  Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting
from changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between
trade date and settlement date on investment  securities  transactions,  foreign
currency  transactions,  and the difference  between the amounts of interest and
dividends  recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

     FOREIGN  SECURITIES.  The Fund may directly purchase  securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES. The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on
investments,  or currency  repatriation,  a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and  recoveries  as  applicable,  based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

     RESTRICTED  AND  ILLIQUID  SECURITIES.  The  Fund  is  not  subject  to  an
independent  limitation on the amount it may invest in securities  for which the
markets are illiquid.  Illiquid securities include securities the disposition of
which is subject to substantial legal or contractual  restrictions.  The sale of
illiquid  securities  often  requires more time and results in higher  brokerage
charges or dealer  discounts  and other  selling  expenses than does the sale of
securities  eligible  for trading on  national  securities  exchanges  or in the
over-the-counter  markets.  Restricted securities may sell at a price lower than
similar  securities that are not subject to  restrictions on resale.  Securities
freely  saleable among  qualified  institutional  investors  under special rules
adopted by the SEC may be treated as liquid if they satisfy liquidity  standards
established by the Board.  The continued  liquidity of such securities is not as
well assured as that of publicly  traded  securities,  and accordingly the Board
will monitor their liquidity.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for on the  trade  date  with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium and  accretion  of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis.  Premiums  and  discounts  on debt  securities  are  amortized  using the
effective  yield  to  maturity  method.  Dividend  income  is  recorded  on  the
ex-dividend date except for certain  dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN  FEE  CREDITS  AND  INTEREST  EXPENSE.  When  cash  balances  are
maintained in the custody  account,  the Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included in custodian fees in the Statement of Operations with the corresponding
expense offset, if any, shown as "custodian fee credits". When cash balances are
overdrawn, the Fund is charged an overdraft fee of 2.00% above the Federal Funds
rate on outstanding  balances.  This amount, if any, would be shown as "interest
expense" in the Statement of Operations.

     DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common  shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  to shareholders  are based on
income and capital gains as determined  in  accordance  with federal  income tax
regulations,  which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles.  These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency  transactions  held by the Fund,  timing  differences,  and
differing characterizations of distributions

                                       17

made by the Fund.  Distributions from net investment income include net realized
gains on foreign currency  transactions.  These book/tax  differences are either
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent,
adjustments are made to the appropriate  capital accounts in the period when the
differences  arise.  These  reclassifications  have no  impact on the NAV of the
Fund.

     Distributions  to  shareholders  of the Fund's  5.875%  Series A Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  Series B Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  Series C
Auction Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock, 6.00% Series D Cumulative  Preferred
Stock,  and  Series E  Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ("Cumulative
Preferred  Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined as described
in Note 5.

     The tax character of distributions  paid during the year ended December 31,
2006 was as follows:

                                              COMMON        PREFERRED

                                           ============    ===========

     PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the  "Code").  It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

     As of December 31, 2006, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

        Net unrealized appreciation on
          investments, written options,
          foreign currency, and swap contracts ..................  $431,173,223

     In July  2006,  the FASB  issued  Interpretation  No. 48,  "Accounting  for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an  Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("the
Interpretation").  The  Interpretation  established for all entities,  including
pass-through  entities  such as the Fund,  a  minimum  threshold  for  financial
statement  recognition  of the benefit of positions  taken in filing tax returns
(including  whether  an entity is  taxable in a  particular  jurisdiction),  and
required certain expanded tax disclosures. The Interpretation was implemented by
the Fund on June 29, 2007 and applied to all open tax years as of the  effective
date.  Management  has evaluated the  application of the  Interpretation  to the
Fund,  and the  adoption  of the  Interpretation  had no impact  on the  amounts
reported in the financial statements.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

3. AGREEMENTS AND  TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Fund will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly  and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's  average
weekly net assets  including the  liquidation  value of the preferred  stock. In
accordance  with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous
investment  program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the  administration of
all aspects of the Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce
the  management fee on the  incremental  assets  attributable  to the Cumulative
Preferred Stock if the total return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund,
including  distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction,  does not exceed
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

     The Fund's total  return on the NAV of the common  shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or  corresponding  swap rate of each particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the period.  For the six months ended
June 30, 2007, the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares  exceeded
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of all outstanding Preferred
Stock. Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

     During  the six  months  ended  June  30,  2007,  the Fund  paid  brokerage
commissions  of $756,778 to Gabelli & Company,  Inc.  ("Gabelli & Company"),  an
affiliate of the Adviser.

     The cost of calculating the Fund's NAV per share is a Fund expense pursuant
to the  Advisory  Agreement  between  the Fund and the  Adviser.  During the six
months ended June 30, 2007,  the Fund paid or accrued  $22,621 to the Adviser in
connection with the cost of computing the Fund's NAV.

     The Fund is  assuming  its  portion of the  allocated  cost of the  Gabelli
Funds'  Chief  Compliance  Officer in the  amount of $19,708  for the six months
ended June 30, 2007,  which is included in payroll  expenses in the Statement of
Operations.

     As per the approval of the Board, the Fund compensates officers of the Fund
that are employed by the Fund and are not employed by the Adviser  (although the
officers may receive  incentive-based  variable  compensation from affiliates of
the Adviser).  For the six months ended June 30, 2007,  the Fund paid or accrued
$110,341, which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement of Operations.

     The  Fund  recaptured  a gain of  $4,338  on the sale of its  shares  by an
affiliate of the Adviser.

     The Fund pays  each  Trustee  that is not  considered  to be an  affiliated
person an annual retainer of $12,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting attended
in person and $500 per telephonic  meeting,  and they are reimbursed for any out
of pocket expenses incurred in attending  meetings.  All Board committee members
receive $1,000 per meeting attended.  In addition,  the Audit Committee Chairman
receives an annual fee of $3,000,  the Proxy Voting Committee  Chairman receives
an annual fee of $1,500,  and the  Nominating  Committee  Chairman  receives  an
annual fee of $2,000.  Trustees who are directors or employees of the Adviser or
an affiliated company receive no compensation or expense  reimbursement from the
Fund.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities for

5. CAPITAL. The Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares
of  beneficial  interest  (par  value  $0.001).  The  Board has  authorized  the

discount of 7.5% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board may  determine
from time to time) from the NAV of the shares.  During the six months ended June
30, 2007, the Fund repurchased 44,100 shares of beneficial  interest in the open
market at a cost of $992,992  and an average  discount of  approximately  11.24%

     The Fund's Declaration of Trust, as amended,  authorizes the issuance of an
unlimited number of shares of $0.001 par value  Cumulative  Preferred Stock. The
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock is senior to the common  shares and  results in the
financial leveraging of the common shares. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common  shareholders.  Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative.  The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the  Statements of  Preferences to meet certain asset coverage tests with
respect  to the  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock.  If the Fund  fails to meet these
requirements  and does not  correct  such  failure,  the Fund may be required to
redeem, in part or in full, the 5.875% Series A, Series B Auction Market, Series
C Auction Market, 6.00% Series D, and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock  at  redemption  prices  of  $25,  $25,000,  $25,000,  $25,  and  $25,000,
respectively,  per share  plus an amount  equal to the  accumulated  and  unpaid
dividends  whether  or not  declared  on such  shares  in  order  to meet  these
requirements.  Additionally,  failure  to  meet  the  foregoing  asset  coverage
requirements  could  restrict  the  Fund's  ability to pay  dividends  to common
shareholders  and could lead to sales of  portfolio  securities  at  inopportune
times.  The income received on the Fund's assets may vary in a manner  unrelated
to the fixed and  variable  rates,  which  could  have  either a  beneficial  or
detrimental  impact  on net  investment  income  and gains  available  to common
shareholders.
     On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of  $77,280,971  (after
underwriting discounts of $2,520,000 and offering expenses of $199,029) from the
public  offering of 3,200,000  shares of 5.875%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. Commencing October 12, 2009 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of Series
A  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in the open  market at prices  less than the $25
liquidation value per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Fund
did not repurchase any shares of 5.875% Series A Cumulative  Preferred Stock. At
June 30, 2007,  3,200,000  shares of 5.875% Series A Cumulative  Preferred Stock
were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $78,334.

public offering of 4,000 shares of Series B and 4,800 shares of Series C Auction
Market Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  respectively.  The dividend rate, as set by
the auction  process,  which is generally  held every seven days, is expected to
vary with  short-term  interest  rates.  The dividend  rates of Series B Auction
Market  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  ranged from 4.70% to 5.31%  during the six

Preferred Stock  shareholders may also trade shares in the secondary market. The
Fund,  at its option,  may redeem the Series B and C Auction  Market  Cumulative
Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the redemption price at any time.  During
the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Fund did not redeem any shares of Series
B and C Auction Market  Cumulative  Preferred Stock. At June 30, 2007, 4,000 and

     On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of  $62,617,239  (after

public  offering of  2,600,000  shares of 6.00%  Series D  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. Commencing November 3, 2010 and thereafter,  the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 6.00% Series D Cumulative  Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of Series
D  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in the open  market at prices  less than the $25
liquidation value per share. During the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Fund
did not repurchase any shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. At
June 30, 2007,  2,600,000  shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative  Preferred  Stock
were outstanding and accrued dividends amounted to $65,000.

     On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of $133,379,387  (after
underwriting discounts of $1,350,000 and offering expenses of $270,613) from the
public  offering of 5,400 shares of Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally held
every  seven  days,  is expected to vary with  short-term  interest  rates.  The
dividend rates of Series E Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock ranged from
4.50% to 5.29% during the six months ended June 30, 2007. Existing  shareholders
may submit an order to hold,  bid,  or sell such  shares on each  auction  date.
Series E Auction Rate Preferred Stock  shareholders may also trade shares in the
secondary market.  The Fund, at its option, may redeem the Series E Auction Rate
Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the redemption price at any time.  During
the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Fund did not redeem any shares of Series

Auction Rate Preferred Stock were outstanding  with an annualized  dividend rate
of 5.15% and accrued dividends amounted to $77,250.

     The holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter  submitted to a vote of  shareholders  of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single class. The
holders of  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock voting  together as a single class also
have the right  currently to elect two Trustees and under certain  circumstances
are  entitled to elect a majority of the Board of  Trustees.  In  addition,  the
affirmative  vote of a majority  of the votes  entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class,  voting separately,  of the
Fund's  outstanding  voting stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a
closed-end  to an open-end  investment  company.  The approval of a majority (as
defined in the 1940 Act) of the  outstanding  preferred stock and a majority (as
defined  in the  1940  Act) of the  Fund's  outstanding  voting  securities  are
required  to approve  certain  other  actions,  including  changes in the Fund's
investment objectives or fundamental investment policies.

6.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Fund enters into  contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown.  However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

7. OTHER MATTERS.  The Adviser  and/or  affiliates  received  subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund share  trading  practices  involving  certain  funds  managed by the
Adviser.  GAMCO  Investors,   Inc.  ("GAMCO"),  the  Adviser's  parent  company,
responded to these  requests for documents and  testimony.  In June 2006,  GAMCO
began discussions with the SEC regarding a possible resolution of their inquiry.
In February  2007,  the Adviser made an offer of  settlement to the staff of the
SEC for  communication  to the Commission for its  consideration to resolve this
matter.  This offer of settlement is subject to agreement regarding the specific
language of the SEC's administrative order and other settlement documents.  On a
separate matter, in September 2005, the Adviser was informed by the staff of the
SEC that the staff may recommend to the Commission that an administrative remedy
and a monetary penalty be sought from the Adviser in connection with the actions
of two of seven  closed-end  funds  managed by the  Adviser  relating to Section
19(a)  and Rule  19a-1 of the 1940  Act.  These  provisions  require  registered
investment  companies  to provide  written  statements  to  shareholders  when a
dividend is made from a source other than net investment  income.  While the two
closed-end funds sent annual statements and provided other materials  containing
this information, the funds did not send written statements to shareholders with
each  distribution in 2002 and 2003. The Adviser  believes that all of the funds
are now in  compliance.  The Adviser  believes  that these matters would have no
effect on the Fund or any material  adverse effect on the Adviser or its ability
to manage the Fund.  The  staff's  notice to the  Adviser  did not relate to the
Fund.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

     It is the policy of The  Gabelli  Dividend  &Income  Trust (the  "Fund") to
automatically   reinvest  dividends  payable  to  common   shareholders.   As  a
"registered"  shareholder you  automatically  become a participant in the Fund's
Automatic Dividend  Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Fund
to issue shares of common  stock to  participants  upon an income  dividend or a
capital  gains  distribution  regardless  of whether the shares are trading at a
discount or a premium to net asset  value.  All  distributions  to  shareholders
whose shares are registered in their own names will be automatically  reinvested
pursuant to the Plan in additional  shares of the Fund.  Plan  participants  may
send  their  stock   certificates   to   Computershare   Trust   Company,   N.A.
("Computershare") to be held in their dividend reinvestment account.  Registered
shareholders  wishing to receive  their  distributions  in cash must submit this
request in writing to:

                       The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust
                                c/o Computershare
                                 P.O. Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

     Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the  shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact Computershare at (800) 336-6983.

     If your  shares are held in the name of a broker,  bank,  or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  re-registered in your own name.
Once  registered  in your  own name  your  distributions  will be  automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

     The number of shares of common stock  distributed  to  participants  in the
Plan in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner.  Under the
Plan,  whenever  the  market  price of the  Fund's  common  stock is equal to or
exceeds  net  asset  value  at the  time  shares  are  valued  for  purposes  of
determining  the number of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of common stock valued at the
greater of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of
the then current market price of the Fund's common stock.  The valuation date is
the  dividend or  distribution  payment  date or, if that date is not a New York
Stock  Exchange  ("NYSE")  trading  day,  the next trading day. If the net asset
value of the common stock at the time of  valuation  exceeds the market price of
the common  stock,  participants  will  receive  shares  from the Fund valued at
market  price.   If  the  Fund  should  declare  a  dividend  or  capital  gains
distribution payable only in cash, Computershare will buy shares of common stock
in the open market, or on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts,
except that  Computershare  will  endeavor to  terminate  purchases  in the open
market and cause the Fund to issue shares at net asset value if,  following  the
commencement of such purchases, the market value of the common stock exceeds the
then current net asset value.

     The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends  and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

     The  Voluntary   Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders  to increase their  investment in the Fund. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

     Participants  in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional cash payments to  Computershare  for investments in the Fund's common
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  Computershare  will use these funds to purchase  shares in the
open  market  on or about  the 1st and 15th of each  month.  Computershare  will
charge each  shareholder who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata share of the
brokerage  commissions.  Brokerage charges for such purchases are expected to be
less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions. It is suggested that
any  voluntary  cash  payments  be  sent  to  Computershare,   P.O.  Box  43010,
Providence,  RI  02940-3010  such  that  Computershare  receives  such  payments
approximately  10 days before the 1st and 15th of the month.  Funds not received
at least five days before the investment date shall be held for investment until
the next purchase  date. A payment may be withdrawn  without charge if notice is
received  by  Computershare  at least  48 hours  before  such  payment  is to be
invested.

     SHAREHOLDERS  WISHING TO LIQUIDATE SHARES HELD AT COMPUTERSHARE  must do so
in writing or by telephone.  Please  submit your request to the above  mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your request your name,  address,  and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

     For more information regarding the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan and
Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan,  brochures are available by calling (914) 921-5070
or by writing directly to the Fund.

     The Fund  reserves the right to amend or  terminate  the Plan as applied to
any  voluntary  cash  payments  made  and  any  dividend  or  distribution  paid
subsequent  to written  notice of the change  sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or terminated by  Computershare  on at least 90 days written
notice to participants in the Plan.
