R. JAY GERKEN, CFA

Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to provide you with the shareholder letter for the Intermediate
Muni Fund, Inc. for the 12 months ended December 31, 2003. After a formidable
run, municipal bonds lost some of the gains they had generated earlier in the
year as signs of a sharp pick-up in the pace of economic growth exerted pressure
on U.S. Treasuries and other fixed-income markets. Although many municipalities
grappled with budgetary pressures brought on by the weak economy, tax revenues
reportedly grew during the third quarter of 2003.

Please read on for a more detailed look at prevailing economic and market
conditions during the fund's fiscal year and to see how those conditions may
have affected fund performance.

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests and
investigations.

As always, thank you for your confidence in our stewardship of your assets. We
look forward to helping you continue to meet your financial goals.

Sincerely,


/s/ R. Jay Gerkin

Performance Review

During the 12 months ended December 31, 2003, the fund returned 13.33%, based on
its American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") market price and 6.22% based on its net
asset value ("NAV")(i) per share. In comparison, the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index(ii) returned 5.31%, and the fund's Lipper general municipal debt
(leveraged) closed-end funds category average was 8.53% over the same time
frame.(iii) Please note that Lipper performance returns are based on each fund's
NAV.

During the period we structured the fund to be less susceptible to rising
interest rates by placing an emphasis on bonds with higher coupons, maintaining
a lower average life, and selling U.S. Treasury futures to hedge the portfolio
against interest rate risk.(iv) This lower-duration strategy at times limited
the fund's full participation in market rallies such as during the first half of
the year, which detracted from the fund's performance versus many of its peers.
However, it helped reduce its volatility during the period, which favorably
contributed to its performance during periods when long-term bond yields were
rising, particularly during the sharp spike in yields the market experienced
from mid-June through the end of July. Sector- and security-specific factors
also impacted the fund's relative performance. The effect of leveraging
positively impacted the fund's performance over the period.

Total returns are based on changes in NAV or the market price, respectively.
Total returns assume the reinvestment of all dividends and/or capital gains
distributions, if any, in additional common shares. Annualized distribution
yield is the common shareholders' current monthly income dividend rate,
annualized, and then divided by the NAV or the market price noted in this
report. The annualized distribution yield assumes a current monthly income
dividend rate of $0.051 for 12 months. This rate is as of December 31, 2003 and
is subject to change.

During the 12-month period, the fund distributed dividends to shareholders
totaling $0.61 per common share. The performance table shows the fund's 12-month
total return based on its NAV and market price as of December 31, 2003. Certain
investors may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax, and state and
local taxes will apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully taxable. Please consult
your personal tax adviser. Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Market Overview

During the spring many states continued to wrestle with addressing budgetary
challenges stemming from a faltering economy. In an effort to jumpstart the
economy, the Fed cut its target for the federal funds rate,(v) which dropped to
its lowest level since the Eisenhower Administration.

U.S. Treasury bonds subsequently sold off, particularly in July, as signs
emerged that economic growth was more robust than previously thought, which
triggered concerns that inflation could pick up. Bond prices have typically
performed less favorably during times when inflation concerns arise. However,
municipal bonds collectively held up better than Treasury bonds during this
tumultuous time. Although the U.S. Treasury bond market regained some of its
footing in September, bonds collectively vacillated during the fall as
third-quarter economic indicators showed stronger-than-expected results.

Despite an improving economy and vibrant stock market, investors' interest in
tax-exempt municipal bonds held firm over 2003 as the Fed signaled that it was
is no hurry to raise short-term interest rates. Consequently, investors
gravitated to the municipal bond market as higher-rated issues offered favorable
taxable equivalent yields(vi) compared to comparable-maturity U.S. Treasuries
and Agencies.(vii)

Additionally, 2003 was a banner year for municipalities in terms of bond
issuance. Municipalities collectively issued over $380 billion of debt to fund
new projects and refinance outstanding bonds.(viii) Tax-exempt new issue volume
exceeded last year's previous record of approximately $358 billion.(viii)
Despite historically low nominal yields, demand was strong as property and
casualty insurance companies, institutions and individual investors combined to
absorb the massive supply.

Selection of Municipal Bonds

The fund has invested primarily in revenue bonds, which generally provide higher
yields than general obligation ("GO") bonds. While the creditworthiness of
revenue bonds is less correlated to tax receipts than GOs because revenue issues
are backed by revenue streams of specific projects, GOs are considered safer
because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the issuing state or
municipality. At the end of the year, the portfolio's heaviest exposure was to
revenue bonds in the hospital, education, water and sewer, and transportation
sectors.

While a few holdings suffered substantial price declines due to credit-quality
deterioration since our last report at mid-year 2003, the impact on NAV was
offset by significant appreciation in other holdings that have benefited from
improving economic conditions.

We remain fairly defensive in terms of interest rate risk. Even though recent
employment results have been lackluster and inflation has so far remained
contained, interest rates have remained quite low by historical standards and
the economy has continued to exhibit strong growth.

The information provided is not intended to be a forecast of future events, a
guarantee of future results or investment advice. Views expressed may differ
from those of the firm as a whole.

Portfolio holdings and breakdowns are as of December 31, 2003 and are subject to
change and may not be representative of the portfolio manager's current or
future investments. Please refer to pages 7 through 15 for a list and percentage
breakdown of the fund's holdings.

All index performance reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes.

i     NAV is a price that reflects the value of the fund's underlying portfolio
      plus other assets, less the fund's liabilities. However, the price at
      which an investor may buy or sell common shares of the fund is at the
      fund's market price as determined by supply of and demand for the fund's
      common shares, which may be more or less than the fund's NAV.
ii    The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is a broad measure of the
      municipal bond market with maturities of at least one year. Please note
      that an investor cannot invest directly in an index.
iii   Lipper, Inc. is a major independent mutual-fund tracking organization.
      Returns are based on the 12-month period ended December 31, 2003,
      calculated among the 64 funds in the fund's Lipper category including the
      reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any.
iv    Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid and harder to
      value, especially in declining markets. A small investment in certain
      derivatives may have a potentially large impact on the fund's performance.
      Derivatives can disproportionately increase losses as stated in the
      prospectus.
v     The federal funds rate is the interest rate that banks with excess
      reserves at a Federal Reserve district bank charge other banks that need
      overnight loans.
vi    The taxable equivalent yield applies to income taxation on a federal (not
      state and local) level. This yield would be slightly lower for an investor
      below the federal income tax bracket of 31% and slightly higher for an
      investor in a higher tax bracket.
vii   The face-value principal and coupon payments of U.S. Government bonds, in
      contrast to municipals, are guaranteed by full faith and credit of the
      U.S. Government.

Take Advantage of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan!

As an investor in the Fund, you can participate in its Dividend Reinvestment
Plan ("Plan"), a convenient, simple and efficient way to reinvest your dividends
and capital gains distributions, if any, in additional shares of the Fund. Below
is a short summary of how the Plan works.

Plan Summary

If you are a Plan participant who has not elected to receive your dividends in
the form of a cash payment, then your dividend and capital gain distributions
will be reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Fund.

The number of common stock shares in the Fund you will receive in lieu of a cash
dividend is determined in the following manner. If the market price of the
common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share ("NAV") on the
determination date, you will be issued shares by the Fund at a price reflecting
the NAV, or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.

If the market price is less than the NAV at the time of valuation (the close of
business on the determination date), PFPC Inc. ("Plan Agent") will buy common
stock for your account in the open market.

If the Plan Agent begins to purchase additional shares in the open market and
the market price of the shares subsequently rises above the previously
determined NAV before the purchases are completed, the Plan Agent will attempt
to terminate purchases and have the Fund issue the remaining dividend or
distribution in shares at the greater of the previously determined NAV or 95% of
the market price. In that case, the number of Fund shares you receive will be
based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the open
market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares.

A more complete description of the current Plan appears in the section of this
report beginning on page 34. To find out more detailed information about the
Plan and about how you can participate, please call PFPC Inc. at (800) 331-1710.

Bond Ratings (unaudited)
================================================================================

The definitions of the applicable rating symbols are set forth below:

Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("Standard & Poor's") -- Ratings from "AA" to
"CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign to show
relative standings within the major rating categories.

AAA        -- Bonds rated "AAA" have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
              Poor's. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely
              strong.
AA         -- Bonds rated "AA" have a very strong capacity to pay interest
              and repay principal and differs from the highest rated issue only
              in a small degree.
A          -- Bonds rated "A" have a strong capacity to pay interest and
              repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the
              adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic
              conditions than debt in higher rated categories.
BBB        -- Bonds rated "BBB" are regarded as having an adequate capacity
              to pay interest and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits
              adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or
              changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
              capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this
              category than in higher rated categories.
BB, B      -- Bonds rated "BB", "B", "CCC" and "CC" are regarded, on
CCC and CC    balance, as predominantly speculative and with respect to capacity
              to pay interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms
              of the obligation. "BB" represents a lower degree of speculation
              than "B", and "CC" the highest degree of speculation. While such
              bonds will likely have some quality and protective
              characteristics, these are outweighed by large uncertainties or
              major risk exposures to adverse conditions.

Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") -- Numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 may be
applied to each generic rating from "Aa" to "Caa", where 1 is the highest and 3
the lowest rating within its generic category.

Aaa        -- Bonds rated "Aaa" are judged to be of the best quality. They
              carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally
              referred to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a
              large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is
              secure. While the various protective elements are likely to
              change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to
              impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues.
Aa         -- Bonds rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all
              standards. Together with the "Aaa" group they comprise what are
              generally known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the
              best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in
              "Aaa" securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of
              greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which
              make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in "Aaa"
              securities.
A          -- Bonds rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes
              and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations.
              Factors giving security to principal and interest are considered
              adequate but elements may be present which suggest a
              susceptibility to impairment some time in the future.
Baa        -- Bonds rated "Baa" are considered as medium grade obligations,
              i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.
              Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the
              present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
              characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such
              bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have
              speculative characteristics as well.
Ba         -- Bonds rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their
              future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection
              of interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and
              therefore not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over
              the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this
              class.
B          -- Bonds rated "B" generally lack characteristics of the desirable
              investments. Assurance of interest and principal payments or
              maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of
              time may be small.
Caa        -- Bonds rated "Caa" are of poor standing. These issues may be in
              default, or there may be present elements of danger with respect
              to principal or interest.

================================================================================
Bond Ratings (unaudited) (continued)
================================================================================

Ca         -- Bonds rated "Ca" represent obligations which are speculative in
              a high degree. Such issues are often in default or have other
              marked shortcomings.
C          -- Bonds rated "C" are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues
              so rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of
              ever attaining any real investment standing.

Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") -- Ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the
addition of a plus (+) sign or minus (-) sign to show relative standings within
the major ratings categories.

AA         -- Bonds rated "AA" are considered to be investment-grade and of
              very high credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest
              and/or dividends and repay principal is very strong.
A          -- Bonds and preferred stock considered to be investment-grade and
              of high credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest
              and/or dividends and repay principal is considered to be strong,
              but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic
              conditions and circumstances than debt or preferred securities
              with higher ratings.
BBB        -- Bonds rated "BBB" are considered to be investment-grade and of
              satisfactory credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest
              or dividends and repay principal is considered to be adequate.
              Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however,
              are more likely to have adverse impact on these securities and,
              therefore, impair timely payment. The likelihood that the ratings
              of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for
              securities with higher ratings.
NR         -- Indicates that the bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's,
              Moody's or Fitch.

Short-Term Security Ratings (unaudited)
================================================================================

SP-1       -- Standard & Poor's highest rating indicating very strong or
              strong capacity to pay principal and interest; those issues
              determined to possess overwhelming safety characteristics are
              denoted with a plus (+) sign.
A-1        -- Standard & Poor's highest commercial paper and variable-rate
              demand obligation ("VRDO") rating indicating that the degree of
              safety regarding timely payment is either overwhelming or very
              strong; those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety
              characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign.
VMIG 1     -- Moody's highest rating for issues having a demand feature -- VRDO.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

1.    Significant Accounting Policies

The Intermediate Muni Fund, Inc. ("Fund"), a Maryland corporation, is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company.

The significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund are:(a)
security transactions are accounted for on trade date;(b) securities are valued
at the mean between the bid and asked prices provided by an independent pricing
service that are based on transactions in municipal obligations, quotations from
municipal bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various
relationships between securities; (c) securities for which market quotations are
not available will be valued in good faith at fair value by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors; (d) securities maturing within 60 days are
valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which
approximates value; (e) gains or losses on the sale of securities are calculated
by using the specific identification method; (f) interest income, adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual
basis; (g) dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded monthly by
the Fund on the ex-dividend date for the shareholders of Common Stock based on
net investment income. The holders of the Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends in accordance with an
auction that will normally be held weekly and out of funds legally available to
shareholders; (h) the character of income and gains to be distributed is
determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. At
December 31, 2003, reclassifications were made to the Fund's capital accounts to
reflect permanent book/tax differences and income and gains available for
distributions under income tax regulations. Net investment income, net realized
gains and net assets were not affected by this change; (i) the Fund intends to
comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, pertaining to regulated investment companies and to make distributions
of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from substantially all Federal income
and excise taxes; (j) the net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock is
determined by dividing the value of the net assets available to Common Stock by
the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. For the purpose of
determining the net asset value per share of the common stock, the value of the
Fund's net assets shall be deemed to equal the value of the Fund's assets less
(1) the Fund's liabilities, (2) the aggregate liquidation value (i.e., $25,000
per outstanding share) of the Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock
and (3) accumulated and unpaid dividends on the outstanding Municipal Auction
Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock issue; and (k) estimates and assumptions are
required to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets
result-

ing from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in the
economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in
determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.

2.    Exempt-Interest Dividends and Other Distributions

The Fund intends to satisfy conditions that will enable interest from municipal
securities, which is exempt from Federal income tax and from designated state
income taxes, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to the
shareholders of the Fund.

Capital gains distributions, if any, are taxable to shareholders, and are
declared and paid at least annually.

3.    Management Agreement and Transactions with Affiliated Persons

Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("SBFM"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment manager to the Fund. As
compensation for its services, the Fund pays SBFM a management fee calculated at
an annual rate of 0.60% of the Fund's average daily net assets. For purposes of
calculating the management fee, the liquidation value of any preferred stock of
the Fund is not deducted in determining the Fund's average daily net assets.
This fee is calculated daily and paid monthly.

All officers and one Director of the Fund are employees of Citigroup or its
affiliates.

4.    Investments

During the year ended December 31, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

================================================================================
Purchases                                                           $40,258,291
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sales                                                                40,889,194
================================================================================

At December 31, 2003, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation of investments for Federal income tax purposes were as follows:

================================================================================
Gross unrealized appreciation                                       $11,359,098
Gross unrealized depreciation                                        (2,807,893)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                         $ 8,551,205

5.    Futures Contracts

Securities or cash equal to the initial margin amount are either deposited with
the broker or segregated by the custodian upon entering into the futures
contract. Additional securities are also segregated up to the current market
value of the futures contracts. During the period the futures contract is open,
changes in the value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or
losses by "marking to market" on a daily basis to reflect the market value of
the contract at the end of each day's trading. Variation margin payments are
received or made and recognized as assets due from or liabilities due to broker,
depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. When the
contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the
difference between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transactions and
the Fund's basis in the contract. The Fund enters into such contracts typically
to hedge a portion of its portfolio. The Fund bears the market risk that arises
from changes in the value of the financial instruments and securities indices.

At December 31, 2003, the Fund had the following open futures contracts:

======================================================================================================
</TABLE>

6.    Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock

On January 28, 2002, the Fund issued 2,000 shares of Series M Municipal Auction
Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock ("ARCPS"). The underwriting discount of $500,000
and offering expenses of $278,731 associated with the ARCPS offering were
recorded as a reduction of the capital paid in excess of par value of common
stock for the year ended December 31, 2002. The ARCPS' dividends are cumulative
at a rate determined at an auction and the dividend period is typically 7 days.
The dividend rates ranged from 0.61% to 1.30% during the year ended December 31,
2003. At December 31, 2003, the dividend rate was 1.05%.

The ARCPS are redeemable under certain conditions by the Fund, or subject to
mandatory redemption (if the Fund is in default of certain coverage
requirements) at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference, which
is the sum of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverages with respect to the
ARCPS. If the Fund fails to maintain these coverages and does not cure any such
failure within the required time period, the Fund is required to redeem a
requisite number of the ARCPS in order to meet the applicable requirement.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
================================================================================

Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing asset coverage requirements would
restrict the Fund's ability to pay dividends to common shareholders.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM") (formerly known as Salomon Smith Barney
Inc.), another indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, also currently
acts as a broker/dealer in connection with the auction of ARCPS. After each
auction, the auction agent will pay to each broker/dealer, from monies the Fund
provides, a participation fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of the purchase price
of the ARCPS that the broker/dealer places at the auction. For the year ended
December 31, 2003, CGM earned $125,095 as a participating broker/dealer.

7.    Capital Loss Carryforward

At December 31, 2003, the Fund had, for Federal income tax purposes,
approximately $7,064,000 of unused capital loss carryforwards available to
offset future capital gains. To the extent that these carryforward losses are
used to offset capital gains, it is probable that the gains so offset will not
be distributed.

The amount and year of expiration for each carryforward loss is indicated below.
Expiration occurs on December 31 of the year indicated:

                           2006       2007        2008        2010        2011
================================================================================
Carryforward Amounts     $38,000   $1,896,000   $514,000   $4,047,000   $569,000
================================================================================

8.    Income Tax Information and Distributions to Shareholders

The tax basis components of distributable earnings at December 31 were:

                                                    2003                2002
================================================================================
Undistributed tax-exempt income                 $   950,395         $   708,351
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Accumulated capital losses                       (7,064,168)         (6,494,699)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unrealized appreciation                           8,551,205           8,428,521
================================================================================

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the differences between book basis and tax basis
unrealized appreciation and depreciation were attributable primarily to wash
sale loss deferrals, the treatment of accretion of discounts and amortization of
premiums and mark to market of derivative contracts.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31 was:


                                                   2003                2002
================================================================================
Tax-exempt income                               $ 9,072,888         $ 8,738,103
Ordinary income                                          --              14,487

9.    Additional Information

The Fund has received the following information from Citigroup Asset Management
("CAM"), the Citigroup business unit which includes the Fund's Investment
Manager and other investment advisory companies, all of which are indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup. CAM is reviewing its entry, through an
affiliate, into the transfer agent business in the period 1997-1999. As CAM
currently understands the facts, at the time CAM decided to enter the transfer
agent business, CAM sub-contracted for a period of five years certain of the
transfer agency services to a third party and also concluded a revenue guarantee
agreement with this sub-contractor providing that the sub-contractor would
guarantee certain benefits to CAM or its affiliates (the "Revenue Guarantee
Agreement"). In connection with the subsequent purchase of the sub-contractor's
business by an affiliate of the current sub-transfer agent (PFPC Inc.) used by
CAM on many of the funds it manages, this Revenue Guarantee Agreement was
amended eliminating those benefits in exchange for arrangements that included a
one-time payment from the sub-contractor.

The Boards of CAM-managed funds (the "Boards") were not informed of the Revenue
Guarantee Agreement with the sub-contractor at the time the Boards considered
and approved the transfer agent arrangements. Nor were the Boards informed of
the subsequent amendment to the Revenue Guarantee Agreement when that occurred.

CAM has begun to take corrective actions. CAM will pay to the applicable funds
approximately $17 million (plus interest) that CAM and its affiliates received
from the Revenue Guarantee Agreement and its amendment. CAM also plans an
independent review to verify that the transfer agency fees charged by CAM were
fairly priced as compared to competitive alternatives. CAM is instituting new
procedures and making changes designed to ensure no similar arrangements are
entered into in the future.

CAM has briefed the SEC, the New York State Attorney General and other
regulators with respect to this matter, as well as the U.S. Attorney who is
investigating the matter. CAM is cooperating with governmental authorities on
this matter, the ultimate outcome of which is not yet determinable.

The Fund's transfer agent is PFPC Inc., which is not affiliated with CAM.

(1)   Effective January 1, 2001, the Fund adopted a change in the accounting
      method that requires the Fund to amortize premiums and accrete all
      discounts. Without the adoption of this change, for the year ended
      December 31, 2001, the ratio of net investment income to average net
      assets would have been 5.31%. Per share information, ratios and
      supplemental data for the periods prior to January 1, 2001 have not been
      restated to reflect this change in presentation. In addition, the impact
      of this change to net investment income and net realized and unrealized
      gain was less than $0.01 per share.
(2)   The total return calculation assumes that dividends are reinvested in
      accordance with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.
(3)   Calculated on basis of average net assets of common shareholders. Ratios
      do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.
(4)   On January 28, 2002, the Fund issued 2,000 shares of Series M Municipal
      Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock at $25,000 a share.
(5)   Excludes accumulated and unpaid dividends.

Independent Auditors' Report
================================================================================

The Shareholders and Board of Directors
of Intermediate Muni Fund, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of Intermediate Muni Fund, Inc. ("Fund") as of
December 31, 2003, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years
in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of December 31, 2003, by correspondence with the custodian
and broker. As to securities sold but not yet delivered, we performed other
appropriate auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Fund as of December 31, 2003, and the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the two-year
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years in the
five-year period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

For Federal tax purposes, the Fund hereby designates for the fiscal year ended

            tax exempt for regular Federal income tax purposes.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited)
================================================================================

Under the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), a shareholder whose shares
of common stock are registered in his own name will have all distributions from
the fund reinvested automatically by PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), as purchasing agent
under the plan, unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. Distributions
with respect to shares registered in the name of a broker-dealer or other
nominee (that is, in street name) will be reinvested by the broker or nominee in
additional shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided by the
broker or nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in cash.
Investors who own common stock registered in street name should consult their
broker-dealers for details regarding reinvestment. All distributions to
shareholders who do not participate in the plan will be paid by check mailed
directly to the record holder by or under the direction of First Data as
dividend paying agent.

The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the plan
in lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. When the
market price of the common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per
share of the common stock on the determination date (generally, the record date
for the distribution), Plan participants will be issued shares of common stock
by the fund at a price equal to the greater of net asset value determined as
described below under "Net Asset Value" or 95% of the market price of the common
stock.

If the market price of the common stock is less than the net asset value of the
common stock at the time of valuation (which is the close of business on the
determination date), PFPC will buy common stock in the open market, on the AMEX
or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. If following the commencement of
the purchases and before PFPC has completed its purchases, the market price
exceeds the net asset value of the common stock as of the valuation time, PFPC
will attempt to terminate purchases in the open market and cause the fund to
issue the remaining portion of the dividend or distribution in shares at a price
equal to the greater of (a) net asset value as of the valuation time or (b) 95%
of the then current market price. In this case, the number of shares received by
a Plan participant will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for
shares purchased in the open market and the price at which the fund issues the
remaining shares. To the extent PFPC is unable to stop open market purchases and
cause the Fund to issue the remaining shares, the average per share purchase
price paid by PFPC may exceed the net asset value of the common stock as of the
valuation time, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or capital gains distribution had been paid in common stock issued by
the Fund at such net asset value. PFPC will begin to purchase common stock on
the open market as soon as practicable after the determination date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution, but in no event

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited) (continued)
================================================================================

shall such purchases continue later than 30 days after the payment date for such
dividend or distribution, or the record date for a succeeding dividend or
distribution, except when necessary to comply with applicable provisions of the
federal securities laws.

PFPC maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmations of all transactions in each account, including information needed
by a shareholder for personal and tax records. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will not relieve plan participants of
any income tax that may be payable on the dividends or capital gains
distributions. Common stock in the account of each plan participant will be held
by PFPC in uncertificated form in the name of the plan participant.

Plan participants are subject to no charge for reinvesting dividends and capital
gains distributions under the Plan. PFPC's fees for handling the reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will be paid by the fund. No brokerage
charges apply with respect to shares of common stock issued directly by the fund
under the Plan. Each plan participant will, however, bear a proportionate share
of any brokerage commissions actually incurred with respect to any open market
purchases made under the plan.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes to it are desirable. The
Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the plan as applied to any
dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution. The plan also may be amended or
terminated by PFPC, with the fund's prior written consent, on at least 30 days'
written notice to plan participants. All correspondence concerning the plan
should be directed by mail to PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 8030, Boston, Massachusetts
02266-8030 or by telephone at (800) 331-1710.

               Committee believes may impair the independence of the auditors.
               As of the date of the approval of this Audit Committee Charter,
               permissible non-audit services include any professional services
               (including tax services), that are not prohibited services as
               described below, provided to the Fund by the independent
               auditors, other than those provided to the Fund in connection
               with an audit or a review of the financial statements of the
               Fund. Permissible non-audit services may not include: (i)
               bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records
               or financial statements of the Fund; (ii) financial information
               systems design and implementation; (iii) appraisal or valuation
               services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports; (iv)
               actuarial services; (v) internal audit outsourcing services; (vi)
               management functions or human resources; (vii) broker or dealer,
               investment adviser or investment banking services; (viii) legal
               services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and (ix) any
               other service the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
               determines, by regulation, is impermissible.

               Pre-approval by the Committee of any permissible non-audit
               services is not required so long as: (i) the aggregate amount of
               all such permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund, the
               Adviser and any service providers controlling, controlled by or
               under common control with the Adviser that provide ongoing
               services to the Fund ("Covered Service Providers") constitutes
               not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid to the
               independent auditors during the fiscal year in which the
               permissible non-audit services are provided to (a) the Fund, (b)
               the Adviser and (c) any entity controlling, controlled by or
               under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing
               services to the Fund during the fiscal year in which the services
               are provided that would have to be approved by the Committee;
               (ii) the permissible non-audit services were not recognized by
               the Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services;
               and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of
               the Committee and approved by the Committee (or its delegate(s))
               prior to the completion of the audit.

         (f)   N/A

         (g)   Non-audit fees billed - $100,000 and $1.2 million for the years
               ended 12/31/2003 and 12/31/2002.

         (h)   Yes. Intermediate Muni Fund, Inc.'s Audit Committee has
               considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
               rendered to Service Affiliates which were not pre-approved (not
               requiring pre-approval) is compatible with maintaining the
               Accountant's independence. All services provided by the
               Accountant to Intermediate Muni Fund, Inc. or to Service
               Affiliates which were required to be pre-approved were
               pre-approved as required.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to
         develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to the
         Manager. The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM"), a
         group of investment adviser affiliates of Citigroup, Inc.
         ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment advisers that comprise
         CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of proxy voting policies and
         procedures (the "Policies") to ensure that the Manager votes proxies
         relating to equity securities in the best interest of clients.

         In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
         principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best interest
         of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all factors that could
         affect the value of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner
         that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
         shareholder values. The Manager may utilize an external service
         provider to provide it with information and/or a recommendation with
         regard to proxy votes. However, such recommendations do not relieve the
         Manager of its responsibility for the proxy vote.

         In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated position in
         the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with such stated
         position. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a list of
         factors set forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such
         issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general
         principles set forth above and considering such enumerated

<PAGE>

         factors. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated
         position or list of factors that CAM considers in voting on such issue,
         CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general
         principles set forth above. Issues for which there is a stated position
         set forth in the Policies or for which there is a list of factors set
         forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such issues fall
         into a variety of categories, including election of directors,
         ratification of auditors, proxy and tender offer defenses, capital
         structure issues, executive and director compensation, mergers and
         corporate restructurings, and social and environmental issues. The
         stated position on an issue set forth in the Policies can always be
         superseded, subject to the duty to act solely in the best interest of
         the beneficial owners of accounts, by the investment management
         professionals responsible for the account whose shares are being voted.
         Issues applicable to a particular industry may cause CAM to abandon a
         policy that would have otherwise applied to issuers generally. As a
         result of the independent investment advisory services provided by
         distinct CAM business units, there may be occasions when different
         business units or different portfolio managers within the same business
         unit vote differently on the same issue.

         In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
         interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to
         identify and address material conflicts that may arise between the
         Manager's interests and those of its clients before voting proxies on
         behalf of such clients. To seek to identify conflicts of interest, CAM
         periodically notifies CAM employees (including employees of the
         Manager) in writing that they are under an obligation (i) to be aware
         of the potential for conflicts of interest with respect to voting
         proxies on behalf of client accounts both as a result of their personal
         relationships and due to special circumstances that may arise during
         the conduct of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to bring
         conflicts of interest of which they become aware to the attention of
         compliance personnel. The Manager also maintains and considers a list
         of significant relationships that could present a conflict of interest
         for the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is also sensitive to the
         fact that a significant, publicized relationship between an issuer and
         a non-CAM affiliate might appear to the public to influence the manner
         in which the Manager decides to vote a proxy with respect to such
         issuer. Absent special circumstances or a significant, publicized
         non-CAM affiliate relationship that CAM or the Manager for prudential
         reasons treats as a potential conflict of interest because such
         relationship might appear to the public to influence the manner in
         which the Manager decides to vote a proxy, the Manager generally takes
         the position that non-CAM relationships between Citigroup and an issuer
         (e.g. investment banking or banking) do not present a conflict of
         interest for the Manager in voting proxies with respect to such issuer.
         Such position is based on the fact that the Manager is operated as an
         independent business unit from other Citigroup business units as well
         as on the existence of information barriers between the Manager and
         certain other Citigroup business units.

         CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager personnel
         are members, to review and address conflicts of interest

<PAGE>

         brought to its attention by compliance personnel. A proxy issue that
         will be voted in accordance with a stated position on an issue or in
         accordance with the recommendation of an independent third party is not
         brought to the attention of the Proxy Voting Committee for a conflict
         of interest review because the Manager's position is that to the extent
         a conflict of interest issue exists, it is resolved by voting in
         accordance with a pre-determined policy or in accordance with the
         recommendation of an independent third party. With respect to a
         conflict of interest brought to its attention, the Proxy Voting
         Committee first determines whether such conflict of interest is
         material. A conflict of interest is considered material to the extent
         that it is determined that such conflict is likely to influence, or
         appear to influence, the Manager's decision-making in voting proxies.
         If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of
         interest is not material, the Manager may vote proxies notwithstanding
         the existence of the conflict.

         If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of
         interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for
         determining an appropriate method to resolve such conflict of interest
         before the proxy affected by the conflict of interest is voted. Such
         determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances,
         including the importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the
         conflict of interest. Methods of resolving a material conflict of
         interest may include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict
         to clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting to
         clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on their
         behalf.

EX 99.CODE ETH

                        SARBANES-OXLEY ACT CODE OF ETHICS
                           FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
      SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF CAM/U.S. REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES

I.    Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

      This code of ethics (the "Code") for Citigroup Asset Management's
("CAM's") U. S. registered proprietary investment companies (collectively,
"Funds" and each a, "Company") applies to each Company's Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller
(the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

      o     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships;

      o     full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to,
            the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by the Company;

      o     compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
            regulations;

      o     the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

      o     accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.   Administration of Code

      The Regional Director of CAM Compliance, North America ("Compliance
Officer") is responsible for administration of this Code, including granting
pre-approvals (see Section III below) and waivers (as described in Section VI
below), applying this Code in specific situations in which questions are
presented under it and interpreting this Code in any particular situation.


<PAGE>

III.  Covered Officers Should Ethically Handle Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
      Interest

      Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Company. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Company.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company because
of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The compliance programs
and procedures of the Company and its investment adviser are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code (see Section VII
below).

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are
also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for a
Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies
and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and a
Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the adviser and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of a Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Funds' Boards of Directors\Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may
also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered
by this or other codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

                           *        *        *        *

      Each Covered Officer must:

      o     not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly
            to influence investment decisions or financial reporting ( e.g.
            through fraudulent accounting

<PAGE>

            practices) by the Company whereby the Covered Officer(1) would
            benefit personally to the detriment of the Company; or

      o     not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for
            the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
            for the benefit of the Company; and

      o     not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made
            or contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others
            to trade personally in contemplation of the market affect of such
            transactions.

      o     There are some potential conflict of interest situations that should
            always be discussed with the Compliance Officer, if material.
            Examples are as follows:

                  (1) service as a director on the board of any public or
            private company;

                  (2) any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
            relationship with, any of the Company's service providers, other
            than its investment adviser,

                  (3) a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
            transaction charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting
            portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than
            an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
            compensation or equity ownership; and

                  4) the receipt of any gifts or the conveyance of any value
            (including entertainment) from any company with which the Company
            has current or prospective business dealings, except:

                        (a) any non-cash gifts of nominal value (nominal value
                  is less than $100); and

                        (b) customary and reasonable meals and entertainment at
                  which the giver is present, such as the occasional business
                  meal or sporting event.

IV.   Disclosure and Compliance

Each Covered Officer:

      o     should be familiar with his or her responsibilities in connection
            with the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the
            Company;

- ----------
(1)   Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
      Officer would also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member
      of a Covered Officer's family (spouse, minor children and any account over
      which a Covered Officer is deemed to have beneficial interest) engages in
      such an activity or has such a relationship.

<PAGE>

      o     should not knowingly misrepresent, or knowingly cause others to
            misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or
            outside the Company, including to the Company's directors and
            auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
            organizations;

      o     should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
            responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
            Funds and the investment adviser with the goal of promoting full,
            fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports
            and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in
            other public communications made by the Funds; and

      o     is responsible to promote compliance with the standards and
            restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.    Reporting and Accountability

      Each Covered Officer must:

      o     upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
            becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that the
            Covered Officer has received, read, and understands the Code;

      o     annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied
            with the requirements of the Code;

      o     annually disclose affiliations and other relationships related to
            conflicts of interest;

      o     not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of
            the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential
            violations that are made in good faith; and

      o     notify the Compliance Officer promptly if he knows of any violation
            of this Code (failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code).

      In rendering decisions and interpretations and in conducting
investigations of potential violations under the Code, the Compliance Officer
may, at his discretion, consult with such persons as he determines to be
appropriate, including, but not limited to, a senior legal officer of the
Company or its investment adviser or its affiliates, independent auditors or
other consultants, subject to any requirement to seek pre-approval from the
Company's audit committee for the retention of independent auditors to perform
permissible non-audit services. The Funds will follow these procedures in
investigating and enforcing the Code:

      o     the compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to
            investigate any potential violation of which he becomes aware;

      o     if, after investigation the Compliance Officer believes that no
            violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to
            take any further action;

<PAGE>

      o     any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will
            be reported to the Directors of the Fund who are not "interested
            persons" as defined in the Investment Company Act the
            ("Non-interested Directors")

      o     if the Non-interested Directors of the Board concur that a violation
            has occurred, it will consider appropriate action, which may include
            review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and
            procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
            adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered
            Officer; and

      o     any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
            be disclosed as provided by SEC rules

      The Compliance Officer shall submit an annual report to the Board
describing any waivers granted.

VI.   Waivers(2)

      A Covered Officer may request a waiver of any of the provisions of the
Code by submitting a written request for such waiver to the Compliance Officer,
setting forth the basis of such request and explaining how the waiver would be
consistent with the standards of conduct described herein. The Compliance
Officer shall review such request and make a determination thereon in writing,
which shall be binding.

      In determining whether to waive any provisions of this Code, the
Compliance Officer shall consider whether the proposed waiver is consistent with
honest and ethical conduct and other purposes of this Code.

VII.  Other Policies and Procedures

      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code. The codes of ethics of the funds and the
investment advisers and principal underwriters under Rule 17j-1 of the
Investment Company Act and the Citigroup Code of Conduct and Citigroup Statement
of Business Practices as well as other policies of the Fund's investment
advisers or their affiliates are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

- ----------
(2)   For purposes of this Code, Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the
      approval by a Company of a material departure from a provision of the
      Code" and includes an"implicit waiver," which means a Company's failure to
      take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material
      departure from a provision of the Code that has been made known to an
      executive officer of the Company.

VIII. Amendments

      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B and C
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a
majority of Non-interested Directors.

IX.   Confidentiality

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board and Company and their
respective counsel, counsel to the non-Interested Directors or independent
auditors or other consultants referred to in Section V above.

X.    Internal Use

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
