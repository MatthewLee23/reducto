Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leverage through borrowings or issuance of
short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept of
leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained from
leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets received from
leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater
than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from the
securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's
net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the
amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

</TABLE>

The U.S. economy has continued to show resilience in the face of the Federal
Reserve Board's (the Fed) continued interest rate hikes and, more recently,
higher oil prices. The Fed's measured tightening program recently brought the
federal funds rate to 2.75% en route to a more "neutral" short-term interest
rate target (relative to inflation). Since the U.S. presidential election,
progress has been monitored on many fronts in Washington, although concerns
remain about the structural problems of debt and deficits, as reflected by a
significant decline in the U.S. dollar.

U.S. equities ended 2004 in a strong rally, but remained in a fairly narrow
trading range for the first two months of 2005. Divergences were notable among
sectors, with energy emerging as a clear leader. On the positive side,
corporations have accelerated their hiring plans, capital spending remains
reasonably robust and merger-and-acquisition activity has increased. Offsetting
the positives are slowing corporate earnings growth, renewed energy price
concerns and the potential for an economic slowdown. International equities,
particularly in Asia, have benefited from higher economic growth rates (China
recorded growth of 9.3% in 2004), stronger currencies and relatively reasonable
valuations.

The major action in the bond market has been a flattening of the yield curve. As
short-term interest rates continued to rise, yields on the long end of the curve
remained relatively stable -- even declining at certain points since the Fed's
monetary tightening program began in June 2004. This phenomenon has been largely
attributed to continued foreign interest in U.S. bonds, which has served to
absorb much of the excess supply. By period-end, many believed long-term yields
were long overdue for a rise.

Looking ahead, the environment is likely to be a challenging one for investors,
with diversification and selectivity becoming increasingly important themes.
With this in mind, we encourage you to meet with your financial advisor to
review your goals and asset allocation and to rebalance your portfolio, as
necessary, to ensure it remains aligned with your objectives and risk tolerance.
As always, we thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your
investment assets, and we look forward to serving you in the months and years
ahead.

                                        Sincerely,


                                        /s/ Robert C. Doll, Jr.

                                        Robert C. Doll, Jr.

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      The Fund's total return significantly exceeded that of its blended
benchmark for the fiscal year, primarily because of our overweight position in
high yield bonds and our active use of leverage.

How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the 12-month period ended February 28, 2005, the Common Stock of Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 9.26% and 9.75%, based on a
year-end per share net asset value of $7.06 and a per share market price of
$6.71, respectively, and $.654 per share income dividends. Over the same period,
the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +15.95%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $6.71 to $7.06, and assuming
reinvestment of all distributions. The Fund's total return for the year
significantly exceeded the +8.25% return of its benchmark, which is an equal
blend of the Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) High Yield Index and the CSFB
Leveraged Loan Index.

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2005, the total investment return on
the Fund's Common Stock was +9.76%, based on a change in per share net asset
value from $6.74 to $7.06, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions. The
blended benchmark provided a return of +5.25% for the same six-month period.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

The high yield market closed out 2004 with an 11% return, far lower than the 29%
return recorded in 2003, but still quite respectable. High yield bond issuance
in 2004 totaled $131 billion, slightly down from $133 billion in 2003. As in
2003, when 79% of proceeds were used to refinance existing debt, some 69% of the
proceeds went for refinancing in 2004 as corporate treasurers continued to
exploit cheaper financing opportunities. While the yield on the 10-year Treasury
note (which is the typical reference rate for high yield bonds) has not changed
appreciably over the past two years, the required spread off of Treasury
securities for high yield bonds has narrowed significantly. This spread
compression has been the principal driver of the high yield bond rally, and has
presented these refinancing opportunities. The high yield market momentum has
slowed somewhat thus far in 2005, with a year-to-date return of +1.31% as of
February 28, 2005.

The market's appetite for risk was greater in 2004 than in 2003, as measured by
the major rating agencies. Issues rated B and lower accounted for 62% of 2004's
high yield bond volume compared to 63% for 2003, 54% for 2002 and 45% for 2001.
Moreover, CCC and split-CCC issuance was 7.2% in 2004 versus 3.0% in 2003 and
..4% in 2002. Despite this, credit measures remained relatively intact.
Debt/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in
2003 was 4.9 times versus 5.0 times in 2004. Interest coverage in 2003 was 2.5
times versus 2.7 times in 2004. The anomaly of better interest coverage despite
higher leverage is explained by compression-driven lower spreads for high yield
bonds. Default rates continued to decline in 2004 to 1.27% versus 4.13% in 2003
and 15.41% in 2002. While 2002 saw the highest default rate ever, 2004 saw the
lowest since 1997, according to CSFB.

Conditions in the leveraged bank loan market were much the same as those
impacting high yield bonds. That is, strong demand has been leading to
compressed spreads, which has encouraged companies to refinance their bank debt.
This dynamic was even more pronounced in the bank loan market because, unlike
high yield bonds, bank loans generally lack call protection.

What factors contributed most to Fund performance?

The outperformance of the benchmark is attributed primarily to an overweight
bond position and our use of the Fund's leverage line. We use commercial
paper-based borrowings up to a maximum of 33% of the Fund's market value. The
average amount of Fund leverage during the six-month period was around 28%. (For
a complete discussion of the benefits and risks of leveraging, refer to page 2
of this report to shareholders.)

Specific credits that made significant contributions to Fund performance
included Viskase Cos., Inc., Vektura (also known as American Commercial Lines or
ACL) and GEO Specialty


4              DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.      FEBRUARY 28, 2005
<PAGE>

Chemicals, Inc. As a result of Chapter 11 proceedings, we received 1.4 million
common shares of Viskase, a company that manufactures cellulosic casings for the
meat processing industry. Over the past year, the market price of Viskase common
stock increased from $.41 to $3.00. The company has not filed public financial
statements since emergence from Chapter 11. The increase in the stock price has
been driven by the successful refinancing and extension of the term of the
company's debt in June, reductions in operating expenses and upgrades to certain
of its facilities.

ACL is a barge transportation company that filed Chapter 11 due to the impact of
depressed operating conditions in the inland waterways. Our $10 million bond
position (which we bought at 50 as a distressed investment) increased in price
from 28 to 64 during the year in response to both improving business conditions
and more aggressive actions by the debtor's board to develop a more favorable
business plan for unsecured creditors. We liquidated this position at 64.

GEO is a specialty chemical company that supplies functional chemicals to a
variety of markets, including the industrial water treatment, paints and
coatings, construction and electronics industries. Our $8.7 million bond
position rallied from 30 to 64 prior to the company's Chapter 11 filing in March
2004. We subsequently participated in financing the company's emergence from
Chapter 11 whereby we have a $10.6 million floating rate note position which
appreciated from 99 to 106.75. The strength of the market segments in which the
company participates has contributed to a favorable financial outlook for GEO.

Investments that detracted from performance included Pegasus Satellite
Communications, Inc. (PGTV), New World Pasta Co. (NWP) and Adelphia
Communications Corp. Two of the Fund's holdings in PGTV, a Direct TV
re-marketing company, collapsed during the year. Our $9.5 million senior note
position fell from 80 to 60, while our $3.5 million preferred position dropped
from 82 to 0. Our hopes for a favorable resolution of some longstanding
litigation following Newscorp's acquisition of Direct TV went unfulfilled. PGTV
filed Chapter 11 on June 2, 2004.

Our $28 million distressed investment in NWP (purchased at 17) declined in price
from 15 to 7 during the year. Operational difficulties, a high debt burden and
sluggish pasta sales combined to force a Chapter 11 filing in the second
quarter. The chief executive officer and chief financial officer were replaced
by a crisis management team from Alix Partners. The unsettled management
situation contributed to the bond's price decline during the year.

Our $7.5 million position in Adelphia convertible debt fell from 39 to 7.75
during the year. Adelphia is in the latter stages of a Chapter 11 restructuring
and has put its cable systems up for bid. Valuations are lower than we expected.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

During the year, we completed a repositioning of the portfolio, moving from 78%
fixed rate and 22% floating rate investments to a 65% fixed rate and 35%
floating rate composition. In doing so, we have essentially lessened the
negative impact that rising interest rates would have on the portfolio's net
asset value.

Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has raised interest rates
25 basis points (.25%) at each of its meetings, bringing the federal funds rate
from 1% to 2.75%. The consensus view is that the Fed will continue its measured
monetary tightening program until the target rate reaches a point of
"neutrality," which most have placed in the area of 3% to 4%. Although long-term
interest rates have been slow to follow short-term interest rates higher -- a
market phenomenon that even Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has called a "conundrum"
- -- we continue to believe that rising long-term interest rates are the primary
threat to investors in the high yield market.

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We would characterize our position at period-end as somewhat more defensive --
increasing our floating rate component while still focused on maintaining the
Fund's attractive yield. We also continue to be cautious and selective in adding
new positions, and intend to maintain our use of leverage within a target range
of 25% - 30%.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on
the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations -- The Fund invests principally in debt
obligations of companies, including Corporate Loans made by banks and other
financial institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds
and notes. Because agents and intermediaries are primarily commercial banks and
other financial institutions, the Fund's investment in Corporate Loans could be
considered concentrated in financial institutions.

(b) Valuation of investments -- Corporate Loans are valued in accordance with
guidelines established by the Board of Directors. Corporate Loans are valued at
the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or more
brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the limited
number of Corporate Loans for which no reliable price quotes are available, such
Corporate Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
pricing matrixes to determine valuations. If the pricing service does not
provide a value for a Corporate Loan, the Investment Adviser will value the
Corporate Loan at fair value, which is intended to approximate market value.

Securities that are held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the
Nasdaq National Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price
on the exchange on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business
on the day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last
available bid price for long positions, and at the last available ask price for
short positions. In cases where securities are traded on more than one exchange,
the securities are valued on the exchange designated as the primary market by or
under the authority of the Board of the Fund. Long positions in securities
traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market, Nasdaq Small Cap or Bulletin
Board are valued at the last available bid price or yield equivalent obtained
from one or more dealers or pricing services approved by the Board of Directors
of the Fund. Short positions in securities traded in the OTC market are valued
at the last available asked price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in
the OTC market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and
most representative market. When the Fund writes an option, the amount of the
premium received is recorded on the books of the Fund as an asset and an
equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently valued to
reflect the current market value of the option written, based on the last sale
price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded
in the OTC market, the last ask price. Options purchased by the Fund are valued
at their last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case
of options traded in the OTC market, the last bid price. The value of swaps,
including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, will be determined by obtaining
dealer quotations. Other investments, including futures contracts and related
options, are stated at market value. Obligations with remaining maturities of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost unless the Investment Adviser believes
that this method no longer produces fair valuations. Repurchase agreements will
be valued at cost plus accrued interest. The Fund employs certain pricing
services to provide securities prices for the Fund. Securities and assets for
which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Directors of
the Fund, including valuations furnished by the pricing services retained by the
Fund, which may use a matrix system for valuations. The procedures of a pricing
service and its valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the
general supervision of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures
will be reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. Government securities
and money market instruments, is substantially completed each day at various
times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities
used in computing the net asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of
such times. Foreign currency exchange rates also are generally determined prior
to the close of business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the values
of such securities and such exchange rates may occur between the times at which
they are determined and the close of business on the NYSE that may not be
reflected in the computation of the Fund's net asset value. If events (for
example, a company announcement, market volatility or a natural disaster) occur
during such periods that are expected to materially affect the value of such
securities, those securities may be valued at their fair value as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or by the Investment Adviser using a

pricing service and/or procedures approved by the Board of Directors.

(c) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the
      change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
      loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may write covered call and put options and purchase
      call and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
      the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
      equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
      marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
      written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
      option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted
      from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to)
      the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund
      enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on
      the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss
      to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid
      or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are
      over-the-counter contracts in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to
      make periodic net payments on a specified notional amount. The net
      payments can be made for a set period of time or may be triggered by a
      pre-determined credit event. The net periodic payments may be based on a
      fixed or variable interest rate; the change in market value of a specified
      security, basket of securities, or index; or the return generated by a
      security. These periodic payments received or made by the Fund are
      recorded in the accompanying Statement of Operations as realized gains or
      losses, respectively. Gains or losses are also realized upon termination
      of the swap agreements. Swaps are marked-to-market daily based on
      dealer-supplied valuations and changes in value are recorded as unrealized
      appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in the returns of the
      underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the
      contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the
      swap agreements.

(d) Foreign currency transactions -- Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.

(e) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

(f) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined
on the


20             DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.      FEBRUARY 28, 2005
<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(g) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(h) Securities lending -- The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least
100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market value of
the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any
additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business
day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the loaned securities,
it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically receives the income on
the loaned securities but does not receive the income on the collateral. Where
the Fund receives cash collateral, it may invest such collateral and retain the
amount earned on such investment, net of any amount rebated to the borrower.
Loans of securities are terminable at any time and the borrower, after notice,
is required to return borrowed securities within five business days. The Fund
may pay reasonable finder's, lending agent, administrative and custodial fees in
connection with its loans. In the event that the borrower defaults on its
obligation to return borrowed securities because of insolvency or for any other
reason, the Fund could experience delays and costs in gaining access to the
collateral. The Fund also could suffer a loss where the value of the collateral
falls below the market value of the borrowed securities, in the event of
borrower default or in the event of losses on investments made with cash
collateral.

(i) Reclassifications -- U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require
that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect permanent
differences between financial and tax reporting. Accordingly, during the current
year, $1,204,682 has been reclassified between accumulated net realized capital
losses and undistributed net investment income, and $263,491 has been
reclassified between paid-in capital in excess of par and accumulated net
realized capital losses as a result of permanent differences attributable to
foreign currency transactions, the reclassification of proceeds on sales of
securities in default, amortization methods on fixed income securities, and
expiration of capital loss carryforwards. These reclassifications have no effect
on net assets or net asset values per share.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner. FAM has entered into a Sub-Advisory
Agreement with Merrill Lynch Asset Management U.K. Limited ("MLAM U.K."), an
affiliate of FAM, pursuant to which MLAM U.K. provides investment advisory
services to FAM with respect to the Fund. There is no increase in the aggregate
fees paid by the Fund for these services.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to perform the investment advisory function. For such services, the Fund pays a
monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average weekly net assets
plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S"), an affiliate of FAM, or its affiliates.
Pursuant to that order, the Fund also has retained Merrill Lynch Investment
Managers, LLC ("MLIM LLC"), an affiliate of FAM, as the securities lending agent
for a fee based on a share of the returns on investment of cash collateral.
MLIM, LLC may, on behalf of the Fund, invest cash collateral received by the
Fund for such loans, among other things, in a private investment company managed
by MLIM, LLC or in registered money market funds advised by FAM or its
affiliates.

In addition, MLPF&S received $2,688 in commissions on the execution of portfolio
security transactions for the Fund for the year ended February 28, 2005.

For the year ended February 28, 2005, the Fund reimbursed FAM $15,616 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, MLAM U.K., PSI, and/or ML & Co.

Quest Cherokee, LLC ........................................              $1,000
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Short-Term Borrowings:

The Fund has entered into a revolving credit and security agreement funded by a
commercial paper asset securitization program with Citicorp North America, Inc.
("Citicorp") as Agent, certain secondary backstop lenders, and certain asset
securitization conduits as lenders (the "Lenders"). The credit facility has a
maximum limit of $343,000,000. Under the Citicorp program, the conduits will
fund advances to the Fund through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper.
As security for its obligations to the Lenders under the revolving
securitization facility, the Fund has granted a security interest in
substantially all of its assets to and in favor of the Lenders. The interest
rate on the Fund's borrowings is based on the interest rate carried by the
commercial paper plus a program fee. The Fund pays additional borrowing costs
including a backstop commitment fee.

The weighted average annual interest rate was 1.91% and the average borrowing
was approximately $304,549,000 for the year ended February 28, 2005.

As of February 28, 2005, the components of accumulated losses on a tax basis
were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Undistributed ordinary income--net .....................        $   5,559,423

*     On February 28, 2005, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
      $326,319,995, of which $12,067,388 expires in 2006, $27,376,921 expires in
      2007, $51,234,056 expires in 2008, $21,442,332 expires in 2009,
      $90,564,493 expires in 2010, $85,285,305 expires in 2011, $17,223,475
      expires in 2012 and $21,126,025 expires in 2013. This amount will be
      available to offset like amounts of any future taxable gains.
**    The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized losses is
      attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash sales, the

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and capital,
including the schedule of investments, of Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. as of
February 28, 2005, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. An audit includes consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of February 28, 2005, by correspondence with the
custodian and financial intermediaries; where replies were not received from
financial intermediaries, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. as of February 28, 2005, the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and its financial highlights for the
five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The following description of the Fund's Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan
(the "Plan") is sent to you annually as required by federal securities laws.

Pursuant to the Fund's Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock otherwise elects,
all dividend and capital gains distributions will be automatically reinvested by
The Bank of New York (the "Plan Agent"), as agent for shareholders in
administering the Plan, in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund.
Holders of Common Stock who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive
all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to the shareholder of
record (or, if the shares are held in street or other nominee name then to such
nominee) by The Bank of New York, as dividend paying agent. Such participants
may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive all distributions of
dividends and capital gains in cash by sending written instructions to The Bank
of New York, as dividend paying agent, at the address set forth below.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by written notice if received by the Plan
Agent not less than ten days prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
termination will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend
or distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares an income dividend or capital gains distribution
(collectively referred to as "dividends") payable either in shares or in cash,
non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock. The shares will be acquired by
the Plan Agent for the participant's account, depending upon the circumstances
described below, either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
authorized shares of Common Stock from the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii)
by purchase of outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open market
("open-market purchases") on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on
the payment date for the dividend, the net asset value per share of the Common
Stock is equal to or less than the market price per share of the Common Stock
plus estimated brokerage commissions (such conditions being referred to herein
as "market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly
issued shares on behalf of the participant. The number of newly issued shares of
Common Stock to be credited to the participant's account will be determined by
dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per share on
the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then
current market price per share on the date of issuance may not exceed 5%. If, on
the dividend payment date, the net asset value per share is greater than the
market value (such condition being referred to herein as "market discount"), the
Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the
participant in open-market purchases.

In the event of a market discount on the dividend payment date, the Plan Agent
will have until the last business day before the next date on which the shares
trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or in no event more than 30 days after the
dividend payment date (the "last purchase date") to invest the dividend amount
in shares acquired in open-market purchases. It is contemplated that the Fund
will pay monthly income dividends. Therefore, the period during which
open-market purchases can be made will exist only from the payment date on the
dividend through the date before the next "ex-dividend" date, which typically
will be approximately ten days. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its
open-market purchases, the market price of a share of Common Stock exceeds the
net asset value per share, the average per share purchase price paid by the Plan
Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisitions of fewer shares than if the dividend had been paid in newly issued
shares on the dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to open-market purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan Agent is
unable to invest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases during the
purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent will cease making open-market purchases and will
invest the uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at
the close of business on the last purchase date determined by dividing the
uninvested portion of the dividend by the net asset value per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnishes
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Plan Agent in non-certificated form in the name
of the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Agent will forward all
proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held
pursuant to the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees which hold shares
of others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan
on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the record
shareholders as representing the total amount registered in the record
shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the
Fund as a result of dividends or capital gains distributions payable either in
shares or in cash. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on such dividends.

Shareholders participating in the Plan may receive benefits not available to
shareholders not participating in the Plan. If the market price plus commissions
of the Fund's shares is above the net asset value, participants in the Plan will
receive shares of the Fund at less than they could otherwise purchase them and
will have shares with a cash value greater than the value of any cash
distribution they would have received on their shares. If the market price plus
commissions is below the net asset value, participants will receive
distributions in shares with a net asset value greater than the value of any
cash distribution they would have received on their shares. However, there may
be insufficient shares available in the market to make distributions in shares
at prices below the net asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem
shares, the price on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

The value of shares acquired pursuant to the Plan will generally be excluded
from gross income to the extent that the cash amount reinvested would be
excluded from gross income. If, when the Fund's shares are trading at a premium
over net asset value, the Fund issues shares pursuant to the Plan that have a
greater fair market value than the amount of cash reinvested, it is possible
that all or a portion of such discount (which may not exceed 5% of the fair
market value of the Fund's shares) could be viewed as a taxable distribution. If
the discount is viewed as a taxable distribution, it is also possible that the
taxable character of this discount would be allocable to all the shareholders,
including shareholders who do not participate in the Plan. Thus, shareholders
who do not participate in the Plan might be required to report as ordinary
income a portion of their distributions equal to their allocable share of the
discount.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right
to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
The Bank of New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY
10286-1258, Telephone: 800-432-8224.

         The nature of the services include assurance and related services
         reasonably related to the performance of the audit of financial
         statements not included in Audit Fees.

         (c) Tax Fees -           Fiscal Year Ending February 28, 2005 - $5,700

         planning.

         (d) All Other Fees -     Fiscal Year Ending February 28, 2005 - $0
                                  Fiscal Year Ending February 29, 2004 - $0

         (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has adopted
         policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services.
         Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided to the
         registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval by the
         Committee. The Committee also must approve other non-audit services
         provided to the registrant and those non-audit services provided to the
         registrant's affiliated service providers that relate directly to the
         operations and the financial reporting of the registrant. Certain of
         these non-audit services that the Committee believes are a) consistent
         with the SEC's auditor independence rules and b) routine and recurring
         services that will not impair the independence of the independent
         accountants may be approved by the Committee without consideration on a
         specific case-by-case basis ("general pre-approval"). However, such
         services will only be deemed pre-approved provided that any individual
         project does not exceed $5,000 attributable to the registrant or
         $50,000 for all of the registrants the Committee oversees. Any proposed
         services exceeding the pre-approved cost levels will require specific
         pre-approval by the Committee, as will any other services not subject
         to general pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services).
         The Committee is informed of each service approved subject to general
         pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board meeting.

         ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant
         to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible

Item 7 - Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
         Management Investment Companies -

         Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

         Each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees has delegated to Merrill Lynch
         Investment Managers, L.P. and/or Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the
         "Investment Adviser") authority to vote all proxies relating to the
         Fund's portfolio securities. The Investment Adviser has adopted
         policies and procedures ("Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the
         voting of proxies related to the portfolio securities held in the
         account of one or more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to
         these Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser's primary
         objective when voting proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely
         in the best interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in
         a manner that the Investment Adviser believes is most likely to enhance
         the economic value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
         Procedures are designed to ensure that that the Investment Adviser
         considers the interests of its clients, including the Funds, and not
         the interests of the Investment Adviser, when voting proxies and that
         real (or perceived) material conflicts that may arise between the
         Investment Adviser's interest and those of the Investment Adviser's
         clients are properly addressed and resolved.

         In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment
         Adviser has formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The
         Committee is comprised of the Investment Adviser's Chief Investment
         Officer (the "CIO"), one or more other senior investment professionals
         appointed by the CIO, portfolio managers and investment analysts
         appointed by the CIO and any other personnel the CIO deems appropriate.
         The Committee will also include two non-voting representatives from the
         Investment Adviser's Legal department appointed by the Investment
         Adviser's General Counsel. The Committee's membership shall be limited
         to full-time employees of the Investment Adviser. No person with any
         investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or research
         responsibilities for the Investment Adviser's affiliates may serve as a
         member of the Committee or participate in its decision making (except

<PAGE>

         to the extent such person is asked by the Committee to present
         information to the Committee, on the same basis as other interested
         knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the Investment Adviser might
         be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to vote the proxies of
         all clients, including a Fund, that have delegated proxy voting
         authority to the Investment Adviser and seeks to ensure that all votes
         are consistent with the best interests of those clients and are free
         from unwarranted and inappropriate influences. The Committee
         establishes general proxy voting policies for the Investment Adviser
         and is responsible for determining how those policies are applied to
         specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique structure,
         management, strategic options and, in certain circumstances, probable
         economic and other anticipated consequences of alternate actions. In so
         doing, the Committee may determine to vote a particular proxy in a
         manner contrary to its generally stated policies. In addition, the
         Committee will be responsible for ensuring that all reporting and
         recordkeeping requirements related to proxy voting are fulfilled.

         The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
         proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires a
         case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect not
         to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
         Investment Adviser believes that certain proxy voting issues require
         investment analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
         corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
         therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may elect
         to adopt a common position for the Investment Adviser on certain proxy
         votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit the
         portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to maximize
         economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell investment
         decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is expected that
         the Investment Adviser will generally seek to vote proxies over which
         the Investment Adviser exercises voting authority in a uniform manner
         for all the Investment Adviser's clients, the Committee, in conjunction
         with a Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
         circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

         To assist the Investment Adviser in voting proxies, the Committee has
         retained Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an
         independent adviser that specializes in providing a variety of
         fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional investment
         managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other
         institutional investors. The services provided to the Investment
         Adviser by ISS include in-depth research, voting recommendations
         (although the Investment Adviser is not obligated to follow such
         recommendations), vote execution, and recordkeeping. ISS will also
         assist the Fund in fulfilling its reporting and recordkeeping
         obligations under the Investment Company Act.

         The Investment Adviser's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
         circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
         instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Investment Adviser
         generally will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities
         that are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
         addition, the Investment Adviser will vote proxies related to
         securities of foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may
         elect not to vote at all in certain countries where the Committee
         determines that the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the
         benefits. The Committee may at any time override these general policies
         if it determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

From time to time, the Investment Adviser may be required to vote proxies in
respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (each, an
"Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Investment Adviser
(each, a "Client") is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the Investment
Adviser's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such conflicts
of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to the Proxy Voting
Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters involving Affiliates and
Clients. If, however, an issue representing a non-routine matter that is
material to an Affiliate or a widely known Client is involved such that the
Committee does not reasonably believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if
the particular proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes of ensuring
that an independent determination is reached, retain an independent fiduciary to
advise the Committee on how to vote or to cast votes on behalf of the Investment
Adviser's clients.

<PAGE>

         In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an independent
         fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an independent
         fiduciary, the powers of the Committee shall pass to a subcommittee,
         appointed by the CIO (with advice from the Secretary of the Committee),
         consisting solely of Committee members selected by the CIO. The CIO
         shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate, only persons
         whose job responsibilities do not include contact with the Client and
         whose job evaluations would not be affected by the Investment Adviser's
         relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such relationship).
         The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to vote all proxies on
         behalf of the Investment Adviser's clients or, if the proxy matter is,
         in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to defer to the
         applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the subcommittee
         determines to alter the Investment Adviser's normal voting guidelines
         or, on matters where the Investment Adviser's policy is case-by-case,
         does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting service
         or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to provide research
         or advice to the Investment Adviser on that matter, no proxies relating
         to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the Secretary's
         absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee concurs that the
         subcommittee's determination is consistent with the Investment
         Adviser's fiduciary duties

         In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Investment
         Adviser has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
         proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
         These policies are guidelines only, and the Investment Adviser may
         elect to vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
         guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
         interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at any
         time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended or
         deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present at a
         Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

         The Investment Adviser has adopted specific voting guidelines with
         respect to the following proxy issues:

o     Proposals related to the composition of the Board of Directors of issuers
      other than investment companies. As a general matter, the Committee
      believes that a company's Board of Directors (rather than shareholders) is
      most likely to have access to important, nonpublic information regarding a
      company's business and prospects, and is therefore best-positioned to set
      corporate policy and oversee management. The Committee, therefore,
      believes that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election
      of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
      represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of the
      corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder value over
      time. In individual cases, the Committee may look at a nominee's history
      of representing shareholder interests as a director of other companies or
      other factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent auditors. As
      a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate auditors have a
      responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders and provide an
      independent view on the propriety of financial reporting decisions of
      corporate management. While the Committee will generally defer to a
      corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the Committee may
      look at an auditors' history of representing shareholder interests as
      auditor of other companies, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

o     Proposals related to management compensation and employee benefits. As a
      general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an issuer's
      compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive compensation, but
      believes that compensation matters are normally best determined by an
      issuer's board of directors, rather than shareholders. Proposals to
      "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation practices or to set arbitrary
      restrictions on compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be
      supported.

o     Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for approval
      of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital structure. As a general
      matter, the Committee will support requests that enhance the rights of
      common shareholders and oppose requests that appear to be unreasonably
      dilutive.

<PAGE>

o     Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an issuer's
      charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee opposes poison pill
      provisions.

o     Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
      corporate meetings.

o     Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings of
      investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the Committee
      believes that a fund's Board of Directors (rather than its shareholders)
      is best-positioned to set fund policy and oversee management. However, the
      Committee opposes granting Boards of Directors authority over certain
      matters, such as changes to a fund's investment objective, that the
      Investment Company Act envisions will be approved directly by
      shareholders.

o     Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner that
      relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns. The
      Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings are
      inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and opposes
      shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or requesting
      release of information that would not help a shareholder evaluate an
      investment in the corporation as an economic matter. While the Committee
      is generally supportive of proposals to require corporate disclosure of
      matters that seem relevant and material to the economic interests of
      shareholders, the Committee is generally not supportive of proposals to
      require disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.

        disclosure controls and procedures to ensure material information
        relating to the registrant is made known to us by others particularly

        270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal half-year of the
        period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is

        control over financial reporting.

                  materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

      5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
