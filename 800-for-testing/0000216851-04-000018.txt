                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation's investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its
investment transactions are set forth in the Corporation's registration
statement.

Security Valuation--Investments in securities traded on national security
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions and Investment Income--Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and options
is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and distributions
to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income is
recognized on the accrual basis.

2.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities, including options, at June 30, 2004 was $381,146,354, and net
unrealized appreciation aggregated $225,498,363, of which the related gross
unrealized appreciation and depreciation were $238,194,052 and $12,695,689,
respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Corporation's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations.

3.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Corporation's investment decisions are made by a committee, and
recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2004 were $31,652,370 and
$34,228,421, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. The Corporation, as writer of an option, bears the risk of possible
illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security values. The
risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally
paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2004 can be
found on page 10.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2004 were as follows:

                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Corporation has an employee incentive stock option and stock appreciation
rights plan which provides for the issuance of options and stock appreciation
rights for the purchase of up to 895,522 shares of the Corporation's Common
Stock at 100% of the fair market value at date of grant. Options are exercisable
beginning not less than one year after the date of grant and extend and vest
over ten years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights are exercisable
beginning not less than two years after the date of grant and extend over the
period during which the option is exercisable. The stock appreciation rights
allow the holders to surrender their rights to exercise their options and
receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the difference between the option
price and the fair market value of the Common Stock at the date of surrender.

Under the plan, the exercise price of the options and related stock appreciation
rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gain paid by the
Corporation during subsequent years. At the beginning of 2004, there were
129,447 options outstanding at a weighted average exercise price of $18.35 per
share. During the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Corporation granted
options including stock appreciation rights for 19,241 shares of Common Stock
with an original weighted average exercise price of $22.86. During the six
months ended June 30, 2004, stock appreciation rights relating to 9,941 stock
option shares were exercised at a weighted average market price of $23.99 per
share and the stock options relating to these rights with a weighted average
exercise price of $13.06 per share were cancelled. At June 30, 2004, there were
outstanding exercisable options to purchase 52,264 common shares at
$10.83-$24.44 per share (weighted average price of $17.95) and unexercisable
options to purchase 86,483 common shares at $15.05-$24.44 per share (weighted
average price of $19.87). The weighted average remaining contractual life of
outstanding exercisable and unexercisable options was 5.25 years and 6.68 years,
respectively. The total compensation expense for stock options and stock
appreciation rights recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2004 was
$118,744. At June 30, 2004, there were 260,373 shares available for future
option grants.

5.  RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covers
all full-time employees with at least one year of service. Benefits are based on
length of service and compensation during the last five years of employment. The
Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plan those amounts that
can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts as the
Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to meet
benefits to be paid to plan participants. During the six months ended June 30,
2004, the Corporation contributed $590,000 to the plan. The Corporation does not
anticipate making additional contributions to the plan in 2004.

In addition, the Corporation has a nonqualified defined benefit plan which
provides eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the qualified
plan.

The following table aggregates the components of the plans' net periodic pension
cost for the six months ended June 30:

                                                                  June 30, 2004

former employees of the Corporation was $1,176,367. Aggregate remuneration paid
or accrued during the six months ended June 30, 2004 to directors and key
employees amounted to $607,413.

7.  PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts
for securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives
compensation in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the
investment of any cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues to
receive interest or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are secured at
all times by collateral of approximately 102% of the fair value of the
securities loaned plus accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of
securities loaned that may occur during the term of the loan will be for the
account of the Corporation. At June 30, 2004, the Corporation had securities on
loan of $38,176,460 and held collateral of $38,883,142, consisting of repurchase
agreements and commercial paper.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(hereafter referred to as the "Corporation") at June 30, 2004, and the results
of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights
for each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Corporation's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States), which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at June 30, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
