SEMIANNUAL REPORT
SEPTEMBER 30, 2005

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

November 15, 2005

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

We are pleased to present you with the semi-annual report for Insured Municipal
Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") for the six months ended September 30, 2005.

PERFORMANCE

Over the six-month period, the Fund returned 3.21% on a net asset value basis
and 6.25% on a market price basis. Over the same period, the Fund's peer group,
the Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) median posted net asset
value and market price returns of 3.79% and 7.22%, respectively. Finally, the
Fund's benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index (the "Index"),
returned 2.80%. (For more performance information, please refer to "Performance
at a Glance" on page 5.)

The Fund continued to use leverage during the period, which was 40% of total
assets as of September 30, 2005. While short-term rates rose over the period and
increased the Fund's borrowings costs, this leverage still had a positive effect
on the Fund's income during the reporting period, as the yields on the Fund's
longer-term bonds more than offset the borrowing costs. Leverage magnifies
returns on both the upside and on the downside, creating a wider range of
returns within the Fund's peer group.

AN INTERVIEW WITH PORTFOLIO MANAGER KEVIN MCINTYRE

Q.  HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.  The US economy faced a number of challenges during the reporting period,
    including record high energy prices, natural disasters, rising interest
    rates, and geopolitical events. Despite these issues, the economy proved to
    be surprisingly resilient. GDP grew at 3.3% in the second quarter, and
    advance estimates for third quarter growth came in at 3.8%, stronger than
    expected in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the spike in oil and
    gas prices.

Q.  HOW DID THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (THE "FED") REACT TO THESE ECONOMIC
    CONDITIONS?

A.  Given the strength of the economy, the Fed continued its tightening
    campaign, raising the federal funds rate (or "fed funds" rate)--the rate
    that banks charge one another for funds they borrow on an overnight
    basis--four times over the period, bringing the fed funds rate to 3.75%.
    Throughout this tightening campaign that started in June 2004, the Fed has
    made it clear that it expects to continue to raise rates at a "measured"
    pace to keep inflation under control and, toward the end of the period,
    seemed to become increasingly concerned about inflation. Accordingly, the
    Fed raised rates another 0.25%, bringing the fed funds rate to 4.0% on
    November 1, after the close of the reporting period.

Q:  FINALLY, HOW DID THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET PERFORM IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?

A:  Over the past six months, municipal bonds (munis) outperformed similarly
    dated Treasuries all along the yield curve. Overall, longer-dated securities
    were the top performers both for munis and Treasuries.

Q:  IN GENERAL TERMS, HOW DID YOU POSITION THE PORTFOLIO?

A:  Given our expectation that yields would continue to rise in concert with the
    Fed's tightening cycle, we maintained a defensive duration position.
    (Duration is a measure of sensitivity to interest rate changes.) Toward the
    end of the period, we went a little longer on duration than we had been for
    previous months, while still remaining defensive relative to the index,
    since we felt market conditions and the continued rising rate environment
    warranted it. In terms of positioning, we maintained a barbell strategy,
    holding relative over-weights to both short-term and longer-term securities,
    while maintaining an underweight position to the 2- to 8-year portion of the
    yield curve. Also, we were underweighted to the 20-year area versus our
    peers. This barbell positioning resulted in underperformance in both the
    10-15 and 20-year areas, as those bonds performed better than their
    short-term counterparts.

Q:  LET'S TALK ABOUT FUND SPECIFICS. YOU WERE RECENTLY GIVEN MORE FLEXIBILITY TO
    INVEST IN AMT BONDS. HOW HAVE YOU PUT THIS STRATEGY TO WORK FOR THE FUND?

A:  AMT bonds, those bonds subject to the alternative minimum tax for certain
    taxpayers, present us with an opportunity to add yield to the portfolio, and
    we now look for attractive AMT opportunities as part of our normal research.
    A couple of AMT bonds that we have added to the portfolio recently include
    Metropolitan Washington DC Airport Authority Bonds that mature in 2016 and
    yield 5.25%, and Hillsborough County for Tampa Port Authority bonds that
    mature at various times from 2016-2019 and yield 5.75%. Both of these

                                        2
<Page>

    bonds were attractively priced and structured, especially when compared with
    non-AMT bonds. The addition of these bonds boosted the portfolio's yield, as
    AMT bonds generally yield more than non-AMT bonds to compensate for the
    possibility that they may be less advantageous from a tax perspective for
    some investors.

Q:  EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE FUND ALSO WAS GIVEN THE ABILITY TO INVEST IN
    NON-INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS RATED AT LEAST BBB/BAA OR THE EQUIVALENT, UP TO
    A MAXIMUM OF 20% OF THE PORTFOLIO. HOW DID YOU PUT THIS FLEXIBILITY TO WORK?

A:  While the Fund continues to invest most of its assets in insured municipal
    bonds, it now does have the latitude to invest outside of the Aaa/AAA
    universe. Any of these new holdings must still be diversified and have
    investment grade ratings. With that said, the past six months have been a
    tough environment in which to find attractive opportunities. Because credit
    spreads (the yield difference between a given bond and a Treasury, which is
    considered risk-free) have been near historical lows, we couldn't justify
    the additional risk these bonds present for only a minor uptick in yield.
    However, if credit spreads widen in the future and we feel those bonds offer
    a yield that adequately compensates for taking that additional risk, we
    expect to selectively add those lower-rated bonds to the Fund's portfolio.

Q:  FROM A SECTOR STANDPOINT, WHAT WERE IMPORTANT POSITIONS FOR THE FUND?

A:  First, it's important to keep in mind that we attempt to maintain a
    well-diversified portfolio, and the Fund holds bonds in a number of
    different industry sectors and subsectors. However, our research leads us to
    focus on various sectors from time to time. Over the last six months, the
    power and water sectors stand out. They were attractive because they tend to
    have stronger revenue and earnings stability through various economic
    climates than other sectors, but are still priced comparably to other
    sectors. Conversely, we maintained the Fund's underweight to tobacco and
    hospital bonds, as we continued to have the same negative outlook we've had
    on these two sectors for quite some time.

Q:  WERE THERE ANY STATES OR REGIONS THAT WERE AN AREA OF FOCUS FOR THE FUND?

A:  From a regional standpoint, we focused on states that exhibited improved
    fiscal health and offered attractively valued municipal bonds. Offerings
    that we believe met that definition included long-term California bonds, a
    state whose fiscal situation has continued to improve since its 2003
    financial crisis, as well as tax-backed New Jersey debt. Finally, it's
    important to note that we had little exposure to hurricane-affected areas,
    and continue to closely monitor the credit quality of those Gulf states and
    municipalities.

Past performance does not predict future performance. The return and value of an
investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold, may be worth
more or less than their original cost. NAV return assumes, for illustration
only, that dividends were reinvested at the net asset value on the payable
dates. NAV and market price returns for periods of less than one year are
cumulative. Returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder
could pay on Fund distributions.

INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end
diversified management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to
achieve a high level of current income that is exempt from federal income tax,
consistent with the preservation of capital. There can be no assurance that the
Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

In the normal course of business the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of representations or that provide indemnification for certain
liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not
yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires the Fund's management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies:

VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--The Fund calculates its net asset value based on the
current market value, where available, for its portfolio securities. The Fund
normally obtains market values for its securities from independent pricing
sources and broker-dealers. Independent pricing sources may use last reported
sale prices, current market quotations or valuations from computerized "matrix"
systems that derive values based on comparable securities. A matrix system
incorporates parameters such as security quality, maturity and coupon, and/or
research and evaluations by its staff, including review of broker-dealer market
price quotations, if available, in determining the valuation of the portfolio
securities. If a market value is not available from an independent pricing
source for a particular security, that security is valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board"). Various factors may be reviewed in order to make a good
faith determination of a security's fair value. These factors include, but are
not limited to, the type and cost of the security; contractual or legal
restrictions on resale of the security; relevant financial or business
developments of the issuer; actively traded similar or related securities;
conversion or exchange rights on the security; related corporate actions; and
changes in overall market conditions. If events occur that materially affect the
value of securities (particularly non-U.S. securities) between the close of
trading in those securities and the close of regular trading on the New York
Stock

                                       22

Exchange, the securities are fair valued. The amortized cost method of
valuation, which approximates market value, generally is used to value
short-term debt instruments with sixty days or less remaining to maturity,
unless the Board determines that this does not represent fair value. Securities
traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market are valued at the last bid price
available on the valuation date prior to valuation.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME--Investment transactions are
recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses from investment
transactions are calculated using the identified cost method. Interest income is
recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized
as adjustments to interest income and the identified cost of investments.

FUTURES CONTRACTS--Upon entering into a financial futures contract, the Fund is
required to deposit in a segregated account with its custodian, in the name of
the futures broker through which the transaction was effected, an amount of cash
and/or municipal obligations equal to a certain percentage of the contract
amount. This amount is known as the "initial margin". Subsequent payments, known
as "variation margin" are made or received by the Fund each day, depending on
the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying financial futures
contracts. Such variation margin is recorded for financial statement purposes on
a daily basis as unrealized gain or loss until the financial futures contract is
closed, at which time the net gain or loss is reclassified to realized gain or
loss on futures. Variation margin calls could be substantial in the event of
adverse price movements.

Using financial futures contracts involves various market risks. If the Fund was
unable to liquidate a futures position due to the absence of a liquid secondary
market or the imposition of price limits, it could incur substantial losses. The
Fund would continue to be subject to market risk with respect to the position.
In addition, the Fund would continue to be required to make variation margin
payments and might be required to maintain the position being hedged or to
maintain cash or securities in a segregated account. Furthermore, certain
characteristics of the futures market might increase the risk that movements in
the prices of the financial futures contracts might not correlate perfectly with
movements in the prices of the investments being hedged, including temporary
price distortion.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends to common
shareholders at a level rate that over time will result in the distribution of
all of the Fund's net investment income remaining after the payment of dividends
on any outstanding auction preferred shares. The dividend rate on the common
stock is adjusted as necessary to reflect the earnings rate of the Fund.

                                       23
<Page>

Dividends and distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Dividends to auction preferred shareholders are accrued daily.
The amount of dividends from net investment income and distributions from net
realized capital gains is determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. These "book/tax" differences are either considered temporary or
permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal
tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.

CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Fund follows an investment policy of investing primarily in municipal
obligations of various states. Economic changes affecting those states and
certain of their public bodies and municipalities may affect the ability of the
issuers within those states to pay interest on, or repay principal of, municipal
obligations held by the Fund.

INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND ADMINISTRATOR

The Board has approved an investment advisory and administration contract
("Advisory Contract") with UBS Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global
AM"), under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and administrator
of the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset management
subsidiary of UBS AG, an internationally diversified organization with
headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland and operations in many areas of the
financial services industry. In accordance with the Advisory Contract, the Fund
pays UBS Global AM an investment advisory and administration fee, which is
accrued weekly and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 0.90% of the Fund's
average weekly net assets applicable to holders of common and auction preferred
shares. UBS Global AM has agreed to waive 0.30% of the advisory and
administration fee, so that the Fund's effective fee is 0.60% of average weekly
net assets applicable to holders of common and auction preferred shares. This
waiver will continue indefinitely unless the Board agrees to any change. At
September 30, 2005, the Fund owed UBS Global AM $258,555, which is composed of
$387,832 of investment advisory and administration fees less fees waived of
$129,277. For the six months ended September 30, 2005, UBS Global AM waived
$787,813 of investment advisory and administration fees from the Fund.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING COMPENSATION TO AFFILIATE OF A BOARD MEMBER

Effective March 1, 2005, Professor Meyer Feldberg accepted the position of
senior advisor to Morgan Stanley, resulting in him becoming an interested
director of

                                       24
<Page>

the Fund. The Fund has been informed that Professor Feldberg's role at Morgan
Stanley does not involve matters directly affecting any UBS funds. Fund
transactions are executed through Morgan Stanley based on that firm's ability to
provide best execution of the transactions. During the six months ended
September 30, 2005, the Fund purchased and sold certain securities (e.g., fixed
income securities) in principal trades with Morgan Stanley having an aggregate
value of $82,449,007. Morgan Stanley received compensation in connection with
these trades, which may have been in the form of a "mark-up" or "mark-down" of
the price of the securities, a fee from the issuer for maintaining a commercial
paper program, or some other form of compensation. Although the precise amount
of this compensation is not generally known by UBS Global AM, UBS Global AM
believes that under normal circumstances it represents a small portion of the
total value of the transactions. In addition, Morgan Stanley may participate as
a broker-dealer in auctions for the Fund's Auction Preferred Shares and receive
compensation therefor. Amounts received by Morgan Stanley, if any, will vary
depending upon that firm's participation in an auction, and such amounts are
calculated and paid by the auction agent from money provided by the Fund.

AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 800 shares of auction preferred shares Series A, 800 shares
of auction preferred shares Series B, 800 shares of auction preferred shares
Series C, 600 shares of auction preferred shares Series D, 600 shares of auction
preferred shares Series E and 600 shares of auction preferred shares Series F
which are referred to herein collectively as the "APS." All shares of each
series of APS have liquidation preference of $50,000 per share plus an amount
equal to accumulated but unpaid dividends upon liquidation.

Dividends, which are cumulative, are generally reset every 7 days for each
Series of APS. Dividend rates ranged from 1.890% to 2.875% for the six months
ended September 30, 2005.

The Fund is subject to certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The APS are entitled to one vote per share and, unless otherwise required by
law, will vote with holders of common stock as a single class, except that the
APS will vote separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law. The
holders of the APS have the right to elect two directors of the Fund.

                                       25
<Page>

The redemption of the Fund's APS is outside of the control of the Fund because
it is redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the
control of the Fund.

PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the six months ended September 30, 2005, aggregate purchases and sales of
portfolio securities, excluding short-term securities, were $161,007,263 and
$141,094,305, respectively.

FEDERAL TAX STATUS

The Fund intends to distribute substantially all of its tax-exempt income and
any taxable income and to comply with the other requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income, net
realized capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, the Fund intends not
to be subject to a federal excise tax.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended March 31,
2005 was as follows:

(1)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a $10,000 purchase of common
     stock at the current market price on the first day of each period reported
     and a sale at the current market price on the last day of each period
     reported, and assuming reinvestment of dividends and other distributions to
     common shareholders at prices obtained under the Fund's Dividend
     Reinvestment Plan. Total investment return does not reflect brokerage
     commissions and has not been annualized for the period less than one year.
     Returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder could pay
     on Fund distributions.

GENERAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

THE FUND

Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") is a diversified, closed-end

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Board has established a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") under
which all common shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names, or
in the name of UBS Financial Services Inc. or its nominee, will have all
dividends and other distributions on their shares of common stock automatically
reinvested in additional shares of common stock, unless such common shareholders
elect to receive cash. Common shareholders who elect to hold their shares in the
name of another broker or nominee should contact such broker or nominee to
determine whether, or how, they may participate in the Plan. The ability of such
shareholders to participate in the Plan may change if their shares are
transferred into the name of another broker or nominee.

A common shareholder may elect not to participate in the Plan or may terminate
participation in the Plan at any time without penalty, and common shareholders
who have previously terminated participation in the Plan may rejoin it at any
time. Changes in elections must be made in writing to the Fund's

                                       31
<Page>

transfer agent and should include the shareholder's name and address as they
appear on the share certificate or in the transfer agent's records. An election
to terminate participation in the Plan, until such election is changed, will be
deemed an election by a common shareholder to take all subsequent distributions
in cash. An election will be effective only for distributions declared and
having a record date at least ten days after the date on which the election is
received.

Additional shares of common stock acquired under the Plan will be purchased in
the open market, on the NYSE or otherwise, at prices that may be higher or lower
than the net asset value per share of the common stock at the time of the
purchase. The number of shares of common stock purchased with each dividend will
be equal to the result obtained by dividing the amount of the dividend payable
to a particular shareholder by the average price per share (including applicable
brokerage commissions) that the transfer agent was able to obtain in the open
market. The Fund will not issue any new shares of common stock in connection
with the Plan. There currently is no charge to participants for reinvesting
dividends or other distributions. The transfer agent's fees for handling the
reinvestment of distributions will be paid by the Fund. However, each
participant pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect
to the transfer agent's open market purchases of common stock in connection with
the reinvestment of distributions. The automatic reinvestment of dividends and
other distributions in shares of common stock does not relieve participants of
any income tax that may be payable on such distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan with respect to any
dividend or other distribution if notice of the change is sent to Plan
participants at least 30 days before the record date for such distribution. The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by the transfer agent by at least 30
days' written notice to all Plan participants. Additional information regarding
the Plan may be obtained from, and all correspondence concerning the Plan should
be directed to, the transfer agent at PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027, Providence,
Rhode Island 02940-3027. For further information regarding the Plan, you may
also contact the transfer agent directly at 1-800-331 1710.

BOARD APPROVAL OF ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

BACKGROUND

At a meeting of the board of Insured Municipal Income Fund ("Fund") on July 20,
2005, the members of the board, including the directors who are not "interested
persons" of the Fund ("Independent Directors") as defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, considered and approved the continuance of the
Advisory and Administration Agreement for the Fund. In preparing for the
meeting, the board members had requested and received information from UBS
Global Asset Management (US) Inc. ("UBS Global AM") to assist them, including
performance and expense information for other investment companies with similar
investment objectives to the Fund. The board received and considered a variety
of information about UBS Global AM, as well as the advisory and administrative
arrangements for the Fund. The Independent Directors discussed the materials
initially provided by management prior to the scheduled board meeting in a
session with their independent legal counsel and requested, and received from
management, supplemental materials to assist them in their consideration of the
Advisory and Administration Agreement. Subsequently, the Chairman of the board
and independent legal counsel to the Independent Directors met with management
representatives to discuss generally how information would be provided at the
board meeting. The Independent Directors also met for several hours the evening
before the board meeting and met again after management's presentation was
completed to review the disclosure that had been made to them at the meeting. At
all of these sessions the Independent Directors met in session with their
independent legal counsel. The Independent Directors also received a memorandum
from their independent legal counsel discussing the duties of board members in
considering approval of advisory and administration agreements. In its
consideration of the approval of the Advisory and Administration Agreement, the
board, including the Independent Directors, considered the following factors:

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF THE SERVICES UNDER THE ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION
AGREEMENT

The board received and considered information regarding the nature, extent and
quality of management services provided to the Fund by UBS Global AM under the
Advisory and Administration Agreement during the past year. The board also
received a description of the administrative and other services rendered to the
Fund and its shareholders by UBS Global AM. The board noted that information
received at regular meetings throughout the year related to the services
rendered by UBS Global AM concerning the management of the Fund's affairs and
UBS Global AM's role in coordinating providers of other

                                       33
<Page>

services to the Fund, including custody, accounting and transfer agency
services. The board's evaluation of the services provided by UBS Global AM took
into account the board's knowledge and familiarity gained as board members of
funds in the UBS New York fund complex, including the scope and quality of UBS
Global AM's investment management and other capabilities and the quality of its
administrative and other services. The board observed that the scope of services
provided by UBS Global AM had expanded over time as a result of regulatory and
other developments, including maintaining and monitoring its own and the Fund's
expanded compliance programs.

The board had available to it the qualifications, backgrounds and
responsibilities of the Fund's senior personnel and the portfolio management
team primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund
and recognized that these persons report to the board regularly, some at every
board meeting. The board also considered, based on its knowledge of UBS Global
AM and its affiliates, the financial resources available to UBS Global AM and
its parent organization, UBS AG.

The board reviewed how transactions in Fund assets are effected. In conducting
its review, the board had available UBS Global AM's brokerage policies and
practices, the standards applied in seeking best execution, UBS Global AM's soft
dollar policies and practices, the use of a broker affiliated with UBS Global AM
and the existence of quality controls applicable to brokerage allocation
procedures. In addition, management also reported to the board on, among other
things, its disaster recovery plans and portfolio manager compensation plan.

The board concluded that, overall, it was satisfied with the nature, extent and
quality of services provided, and expected to be provided, to the Fund under the
Advisory and Administration Agreement.

FUND PERFORMANCE

The board received and considered performance information of the Fund compared
to other funds (the "Performance Universe") selected by Lipper, Inc. ("Lipper"),
an independent provider of investment company data, over the one-, three-, five-
and ten-year periods, ended May 31, 2005 and since inception. The board was
provided with a description of the methodology Lipper used to determine the
similarity of the Fund with the funds included in the Performance Universe. The
board also noted that it had received information throughout the year at
periodic intervals with respect to the Fund's performance.

The comparative Lipper information showed that the Fund's performance as
compared against the Performance Universe was consistently below average

                                       34
<Page>

for the comparative periods. Specifically, the Fund's performance was in the
fourth and fifth quintile for all comparative periods. The board in its review
noted that management explained that the Fund had consistently underperformed
due in large part to its conservative duration, higher overall credit quality
and an aversion to significant exposure to securities subject to the alternative
minimum tax ("AMT"). In addition, the board noted several changes made in recent
years that should provide the portfolio management team with increased
flexibility over the long-term. The changes included the following: (1)
increased ability to invest in securities having a maturity of ten years or
less, (2) increased ability to use derivatives to hedge unwanted duration
exposure while preserving security selection opportunities, (3) increasing the
amount of leverage to take advantage of a continued steepness in the yield
curve, (4) potential increased AMT exposure, and (5) modifying investment
policies to permit investment of up to twenty percent (20%) of the Fund in
investment grade instruments that are not insured. Based on its review and facts
stated above, the board concluded that the Fund's investment performance was
satisfactory.

MANAGEMENT FEES AND EXPENSE RATIO

The board reviewed and considered the contractual advisory and administration
fee (the "Contractual Management Fee") payable by the Fund to UBS Global AM in
light of the nature, extent and quality of the advisory and administrative
services provided by UBS Global AM. The board also reviewed and considered the
actual fee rate (the "Actual Management Fee") paid by the Fund.

Additionally, the board received and considered information comparing the Fund's
Contractual Management Fee, Actual Management Fee and overall expenses with
those of funds in a group of funds selected and provided by Lipper (the "Expense
Group").

In connection with its consideration of the Fund's management fees, the board
also received information on an affiliate of UBS Global AM's standard
institutional account fees for accounts of a similar investment type to the
Fund. The board noted that these fees were lower than the Contractual Management
Fee and Actual Management Fee for the Fund, but also noted management's
explanation that comparisons with such accounts may be of limited relevance
given the different structures and regulatory requirements of mutual funds
versus such accounts, the differences in the levels of services required by
mutual funds and such accounts and the memorandum provided by the Fund's legal
counsel discussing court decisions regarding the limited usefulness of such
comparisons.

                                       35
<Page>

The comparative Lipper information showed that the Fund's Contractual Management
Fee and Actual Management Fee were in the fifth quintile in its Expense Group
(i.e., eight out of eight for the periods included in the Lipper report). The
board noted that UBS Global AM currently has a fee waiver in place whereby it
waives 30 basis points (0.30%) from its Contractual Management Fee and that the
fee waiver will continue indefinitely unless the board agrees to a change in the
waiver. In addition, the board also noted that the Fund's total expenses were
the highest out of the eight funds in its Expense Group. The board noted that
the Fund's high Actual Total Expenses was the result of the Fund's high Actual
Management Fee and its high custodian fee. Management noted that the Fund's
custodian fees appear to be higher than those of other funds in its Expense
Group because accounting costs are also included in the Fund's custodian fees,
which may not be the case for some of its peers in the Fund's Expense Group.
Management also noted that it had increased its fee waiver by one-half (from
0.20% to 0.30%) during the course of the past year but that the impact of the
increased waiver was not fully reflected in the Lipper data. The Board
considered that the fee was more acceptable once the fee waiver was taken into
account. Management noted that the Fund's Actual Management Fee was higher than
its peers, if only by less than one-quarter of one percent, primarily because of
the higher degree of leverage of the Fund. If the Actual Management Fees in the
peer group were adjusted for the relative degrees of leverage to facilitate a
more meaningful comparison, the Fund's Actual Management Fee would be more
consistent with the peer median. Management added that it would attempt to
negotiate a reduction in the Fund's custodian fees.

Taking all of the above into consideration, the board determined that the
Contractual Management Fee was reasonable in light of the nature, extent and
quality of the services provided to the Fund under the Advisory and
Administration Agreement.

ADVISOR PROFITABILITY

The board received and considered a profitability analysis of UBS Global AM and
its affiliates in providing services to the Fund. The board also received
profitability information with respect to the UBS New York fund complex as a
whole. In addition, the board received information with respect to UBS Global
AM's allocation methodologies used in preparing this profitability data. UBS
Global AM's profitability was considered not excessive in light of the nature,
extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund.

                                       36
<Page>

ECONOMIES OF SCALE

The board received and considered information from management regarding whether
it has achieved economies of scale with respect to the management of the Fund,
whether the Fund has appropriately benefited from any economies of scale, and
whether there is potential realization of further economies of scale. The board
considered whether economies of scale in the provision of services to the Fund
were being passed along to shareholders. The board also considered whether
alternative fee structures (such as breakpoints) would be more appropriate or
reasonable taking into consideration economies of scale or other efficiencies.

In conducting its review, the board noted that the Fund's Contractual Management
Fee did not contain any breakpoints. Further, the board noted that advisory
agreements of closed-end funds usually do not contain breakpoints. Management
informed the board that the Fund, as a closed-end investment company, was not
expected to materially increase in size; thus, UBS Global AM would not benefit
from economies of scale. The Board members considered whether economies of scale
could be realized because UBS Global AM advises other similar funds, and, based
on their experience, the board accepted UBS Global AM's explanation that
significant economies of scale would not be realized because of the nature of
the market in which the Fund invests did not provide significant savings.

OTHER BENEFITS TO UBS GLOBAL AM

The board considered other benefits received by UBS Global AM and its affiliates
as a result of its relationship with the Fund, including the opportunity to
offer additional products and services to Fund shareholders.

In light of the costs of providing investment management, administrative and
other services to the Fund and UBS Global AM's ongoing commitment to the Fund,
the profits and other ancillary benefits that UBS Global AM and its affiliates
received were considered reasonable.

In light of all of the foregoing, the board approved the Advisory and
Administration Agreement to continue for another year.

In making its decision, the board identified no single factor as being
determinative in approving the Advisory and Administration Agreement. The
Independent Directors were advised by separate independent legal counsel
throughout the entire process. The board discussed the proposed continuance of
the Advisory and Administration Agreement in a private session with their
independent legal counsel at which no representatives of UBS Global AM were
present.

               disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

               known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
               the period in which this report is being prepared;

               accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

          (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure

               control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
               fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
               materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
               affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
               reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
               which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
