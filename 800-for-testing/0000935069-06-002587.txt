- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.       ORGANIZATION

         UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund") was organized as a limited liability
         company  under the laws of Delaware on September  4, 2002.  The Fund is
         registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
         "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,  non-diversified,  management  investment
         company.   The  Fund's   investment   objective   is  to  seek  capital
         appreciation over the long term. The Fund is a multi-manager  fund that
         seeks to achieve its  objective by deploying  its assets among a select
         group of portfolio  managers who  primarily  employ  long/short  equity
         strategies,  including those involving foreign issuers. Generally, such
         portfolio   managers   conduct  their   investment   programs   through
         unregistered  investment funds (collectively,  the "Investment Funds"),
         in which the Fund invests as a limited  partner,  member or shareholder
         along with other investors.  The Fund commenced  operations on February
         1, 2003.

         The  Fund's  Board  of   Directors   (the   "Directors")   has  overall
         responsibility  to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund,
         including the exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish policies
         regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.
         The  Directors  have engaged UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the
         "Adviser"  and,  when  providing   services  under  the  Administration
         Agreement, the "Administrator"),  a Delaware limited liability company,
         to provide  investment  advice  regarding  the  selection of Investment
         Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

         The Adviser is an indirect  wholly owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,
         Inc.,  which is a wholly owned  subsidiary of UBS AG, and is registered
         as an investment adviser under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as
         amended.

         Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors
         may be  accepted at such times as the  Adviser  may  determine  and are
         generally  accepted monthly.  The Fund reserves the right to reject any
         application for interests in the Fund.

         The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant
         to written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such
         times and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their
         complete and exclusive discretion.  Members can only transfer or assign
         their  membership  interests  (i) by  operation  of law pursuant to the
         death, bankruptcy,  insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii) with
         the written  approval of the Directors,  which may be withheld in their
         sole and absolute discretion.


2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
         Adviser as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal  period in
         accordance  with the valuation  principles set forth below or as may be
         determined  from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the
         Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to
         the terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and


                                                                               5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         offering   memoranda,   as  appropriate.   The  Fund's  investments  in
         Investment  Funds are carried at fair value as determined by the Fund's
         pro rata  interest  in the net  assets  of each  Investment  Fund.  All
         valuations  utilize financial  information  supplied by each Investment
         Fund  and are  net of  management  and  performance  incentive  fees or
         allocations  payable to the Investment  Funds'  managers or pursuant to
         the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The Fund's  valuation  procedures
         require the Adviser to consider all relevant  information  available at
         the time the Fund values its  portfolio.  The Adviser  and/or the Board
         will consider such  information and consider whether it is appropriate,
         in light of all relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its
         net asset  value as  reported  or whether  to adjust  such  value.  The
         underlying  investments  of each  Investment  Fund are accounted for at
         fair value as described in each Investment Fund's financial  statements
         (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

         Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in
         the form of cash or securities, are first applied as a reduction of the
         investment's cost.

         B. INCOME RECOGNITION

         Interest  income is recorded on the accrual  basis.  Realized gains and
         losses  from  Investment  Fund   transactions  are  calculated  on  the
         identified cost basis.

         C. FUND COSTS

         The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but
         not  limited  to,  the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to
         portfolio  transactions  and  positions for the Fund's  account;  legal
         fees;  accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing
         the Fund's net asset value; costs of insurance;  registration expenses;
         certain organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related
         expenses; expenses of meetings of Directors and Members; all costs with
         respect to  communications  to  Members;  and other  types of  expenses
         approved by the Directors.  Syndication costs are charged to capital as
         incurred.

         D. INCOME TAXES

         No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes
         has been  provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax.  Each
         Member is  individually  required  to report on its own tax  return its
         distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

                                                                               6

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                                                     (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank, NA
         account that pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost plus
         accrued  interest,  which is  included in  interest  receivable  on the
         Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         F. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

         From time to time the Fund may enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
         connection  with such  transactions  it is the Fund's  policy  that its
         custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities,  the
         fair value of which  exceeds  the  principal  amount of the  repurchase
         transaction,  including accrued  interest,  at all times. If the seller
         defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines, realization of
         the  collateral  by the Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of June 30,
         2006 there were no open repurchase agreements.

         G. USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Fund's financial statements are
         reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from these
         estimates.

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         The Adviser provides  investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant
         to an Investment  Manager  Agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement,  the
         Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the  "Investment  Management Fee")
         at the annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund's net assets,  excluding assets
         attributable to the Adviser and the  Administrator.  The  Administrator
         provides certain administrative services to the Fund, including,  among
         other things,  providing  office space and other support  services.  In
         consideration  for such  services,  the Fund pays the  Administrator  a
         monthly fee (the "Administrator Fee") at an annual rate of 0.30% of the
         Fund's net assets, excluding assets attributable to the Administrator's
         and  the  Adviser's  capital  account.  The  Administrator  Fee and the
         Investment  Management Fee will be paid to the Administrator out of the
         Fund's  assets and  debited  against  the  Members'  capital  accounts,
         excluding  net  assets  attributable  to the  Administrator's  and  the
         Adviser's capital account.  A portion of the Investment  Management Fee
         and the Administrator Fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

         UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
         UBS Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without
         special  compensation  from  the  Fund,  and will  bear  its own  costs
         associated with its activities as placement  agent.  Placement fees, if
         any,  charged on  contributions  are debited  against the  contribution
         amounts to arrive at a net subscription  amount. The placement fee does
         not constitute assets of the Fund.

                                                                               7

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

         The net  increase  (or  decrease)  in  Members'  capital  derived  from
         operations (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of
         all Members on a pro-rata basis,  other than the Investment  Management
         Fee and the  Administrator  Fee which are  similarly  allocated  to all
         Members other than the Adviser or Administrator as described above.

         In order to  achieve a more  equitable  distribution  of the  impact of
         certain initial  organization  and offering costs,  the Fund has either
         credited to or debited against the Members' capital accounts the sum of
         such initial  costs based on each  individual  Member's  percentage  of
         capital in the Fund. The reallocation of these costs will occur for the
         first twelve months after the initial closing date of the Fund.

         Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a
         fee for each meeting attended. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund
         for all reasonable out of pocket  expenses.  Total amounts  expensed by
         the Fund  related to  Directors  for the period from January 1, 2006 to
         June 30, 2006 were $14,410 which is included in miscellaneous expense.

4. ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

         PFPC  Trust  Company  (an  affiliate  of PNC  Bank,  NA)  serves as the
         custodian (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides custodial
         services for the Fund.

         PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as Accounting and
         Investor  Servicing  Agent to the Fund  and in that  capacity  provides
         certain  administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax and Member
         related services. PFPC Inc. receives a monthly fee primarily based upon
         (i) the  average  net assets of the Fund  subject to a minimum  monthly
         fee, and (ii) the  aggregate  net assets of the Fund and certain  other
         investment  funds  sponsored  or advised by UBS  Americas,  Inc. or its
         affiliates.  Additionally,  the Fund  reimburses  certain out of pocket
         expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

5. CREDIT FACILITY

         Effective July 1, 2005 the Fund,  along with other UBS sponsored funds,
         entered into a  $150,000,000  committed,  unsecured  revolving  line of
         credit with Harris Trust and Savings Bank.  Under the most  restrictive
         arrangement, the Fund may borrow an amount that combined with the other
         borrowings  of the Fund  would not exceed  20% of its net  assets.  The
         Fund's borrowing  capacity is also limited to the portion of the unused
         line of credit at any point in time.  The Fund is only liable under the
         line of credit to the  extent of its own  borrowing  there  under.  The
         interest  rate on the borrowing is based on the Federal Funds rate plus
         150  basis  points  per  annum.  The  expiration  date of  such  credit
         agreements is June 30, 2006. The committed facility also requires a fee
         to be paid by the Fund, on a pro rata basis, based on the amount of the
         aggregate commitment which has not been utilized of 25 basis points per
         annum. For the period from January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2006, the Fund's
         average  interest rate paid on  borrowings  was 5.39% per annum and the
         average  borrowings  outstanding were $2,563,536.  Interest expense for
         the period was $68,522 of which $16,486 was payable at period end.

                                                                               8

6. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases and sales of Investment  Funds for the period from
         January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2006 amounted to $162,500,000  and $91,720,
         respectively.

         The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
         items of  taxable  income  allocated  to the Fund  from the  Investment
         Funds.  The  allocated  taxable  income is  reported to the Fund by the
         Investment Funds on Schedules K-1.

7.       INVESTMENTS

         As of June 30, 2006, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none
         of which were related  parties.  The Fund's  investments are summarized
         below based on the  investment  objectives  of the specific  Investment
         Funds at June 30, 2006.

         INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE                   COST          FAIR VALUE

         Long/Short Equity                  $550,500,000     $682,624,348

         The agreements  related to investments in Investment  Funds provide for
         compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management
         fees of between 1% and 2.5% (per  annum) of net assets and  performance
         incentive fees or allocations  ranging from 16.5% to 25% of net profits
         earned.  The Investment  Funds provide for periodic  redemptions,  with
         lock up provisions of up to two years from initial investment. Detailed
         information  about the Investment  Funds'  portfolios is not available.
         Some of the  underlying  Funds have side pockets.  Therefore,  the Fund
         cannot fully redeem unless there is a realizable event.

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

         In the normal  course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the
         Fund invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
         investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but
         are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
         contracts for differences, and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in
         these Investment Funds is limited to the value of these  investments as
         reported by the Fund.

9.       INDEMNIFICATION

         In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts
         or  agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future
         events  could  occur  that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions
         against the Fund. Based on its history and experience, management feels
         that the likelihood of such an event is remote.

                                                                               9

              a   Ratio of total expenses to average net assets does not include
                  the impact of expenses for incentive  allocations or incentive
                  fees related to the underlying Investment Funds.
              *   Annualized.
             **   Total return  assumes a purchase of an interest in the Fund at
                  the beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund interest on
                  the last day of the  period  noted  and does not  reflect  the
                  deduction of placement fees, if any, incurred when subscribing
                  to the Fund.  Total  returns  for a period of less than a full
                  year are not  annualized.  An individual  member's  ratios and
                  return may vary from the above  based on the timing of capital
                  transactions.
            ***   The average net assets used in the above ratios are calculated
                  by adding any withdrawals  payable effective at the end of the
                  period to the net assets for such period.

11. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

         Effective July 1, 2006, the Fund, along with other UBS sponsored funds,

         expiration date of such credit agreement is July 31, 2007.
