President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

While investors were greeted with a challenging market environment for the first
several weeks of 2016, the U.S. market generated modest single-digit returns for
both stocks and bonds through September 30, 2016 (the Bloomberg Barclays
Aggregate Bond Index was up by 5.8% through September 30, 2016, and the Standard
& Poor's 500 Index was up by 7.8%). Yet, it is becoming increasingly clear that
the investment landscape is undergoing significant change. For the past eight
years, global central banks have been the dominant force in the markets by
maintaining government bond yields at close to zero in an effort to stimulate
economic growth. With little room to lower rates further, however, central banks
may be losing their effectiveness. Many economies around the world are
experiencing slow growth as they face a variety of challenges, including the
shifting geopolitics driving "Brexit" - the United Kingdom's pending exit from
the European Union - as well as related movements in Europe, limited
productivity gains, aging populations, and transitioning economic models in
China and other emerging markets. In the United States, gross domestic product
(GDP) grew at a rate of approximately 1.2% in the first half of 2016, but GDP
growth registered a strong uptick in the third quarter of the year, driven
primarily by U.S. consumers.

Investors currently face a difficult environment. Government bond yields, as
noted earlier, had been near zero for most of the year and offered minimal
opportunity to produce income. However, recent developments such as the Federal
Reserve's decision to increase the Federal funds rate before the end of 2016
have driven yields slightly higher. The central bank-driven bull market in
riskier assets has pushed up valuations towards historic highs in the equity and
investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond markets. Central banks have
pledged to move gradually to normalize interest-rate policies as the global
economy recovers, but it may take many years for this historic credit cycle to
unwind. Politics may also influence markets or investor sentiment given the
current global political landscape. Donald Trump's victory in the November U.S.
presidential election seems to have sparked a late-year market rally, given the
pro-growth proposals he promoted on the campaign trail, but it is unclear just
how many of his policy initiatives will be implemented. In addition, continued
challenges with Brexit and other geopolitical issues have the potential to
increase market volatility going forward. Against this backdrop, investors are
likely to face ongoing challenges when it comes to finding opportunities for
both income and capital appreciation, and while much has been made of passive
investing, we believe all investment decisions are active choices.

Portfolio Management Discussion | 11/30/16

Floating-rate bank loans staged a brisk rally over the final nine months of the
12-month period ended November 30, 2016, as investors grew more confident in the
U.S. economic outlook. In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses
the factors that affected the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during
the 12-month period. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice president and a portfolio
manager at Pioneer, is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q    How did the Trust perform during the 12-month period ended November 30,
     2016?

A    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 8.31% at net asset value and 15.92% at
     market price during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2016, while the
     Trust's linked benchmark returned 8.36%*. The Trust's linked benchmark
     combines returns of the Trust's current benchmark, the Standard &
     Poor's/Loan Syndications & Trading Association Leveraged Loan Index, and
     the Trust's former benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans
     Index. Unlike the Trust, the linked benchmark does not use leverage. While
     the use of leverage increases investment opportunity, it also increases
     investment risk. During the same 12-month period, the average return (at
     market price) of the 22 closed end funds in Lipper's Loan Participation
     Funds category (which may or may not be leveraged), was 18.97%, and the
     average return (at market price) of the 27 closed end funds in
     Morningstar's Bank Loan Funds category (which may or may not be leveraged),
     was 19.20%.

     The shares of the Trust were selling at a 5.76% discount to net asset value
     on November 30, 2016.

     The Trust's standard, 30-day SEC yield was 4.12% on November 30, 2016**.

Q    How would you describe the investment environment for bank loans during the
     12-month period ended November 30, 2016?

A    In the early part of the 12-month period, market sentiment was relatively
     pessimistic with regard to the health of both the domestic and global
     economies. As the period progressed, however, investors grew increasingly
     optimistic that the economic outlook was improving. As the economic

*    The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Bloomberg Barclays
     Index) was the Trust's benchmark from inception through 9/30/16, when the
     Bloomberg Barclays Index ceased. As of 10/1/16, the Trust's benchmark is
     the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the S&P/LSTA Index). Both the Bloomberg
     Barclays Index and the S&P/LSTA Index provide broad and comprehensive total
     return metrics of the U.S. universe of syndicated term loans.

**   The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized formula that is based on the
     hypothetical annualized earning power (investment income only) of the
     Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

     outlook brightened, floating-rate bank loans and other credit-sensitive
     investments rallied, overcoming generally negative returns in the early
     weeks of the period to deliver healthy performance over the full 12 months.
     During the rally, bank loans with lower credit quality ratings and higher
     yields generally outperformed higher-quality instruments, a scenario
     consistent with results of other sectors of the fixed-income market.

     During the early weeks of the period, which began on December 1, 2015, bank
     loans and other credit-sensitive fixed-income sectors produced negative
     results as investors worried about weakening oil and commodity prices, data
     pointing to stubbornly sluggish economic growth in the United States, and
     evidence of softening economic activity overseas. That all changed in early
     February 2016, however, when the prices for oil and other commodities
     bottomed and then began strengthening, the value of the U.S. dollar peaked,
     and new evidence emerged of gathering economic strength in the United
     States. The resulting rally in higher-yielding, more credit-sensitive
     investments, including bank loans, continued nearly unabated for the next
     eight months. A two-day sell-off in late June caused by the unexpected news
     that British citizens had voted to exit ("Brexit") the European Union
     briefly interrupted the hot streak, but the market quickly regained its
     footing even before the end of the second calendar quarter on June 30.

     The rally in credit-sensitive securities did finally begin to lose some
     momentum in November 2016, the final month of the period, as the market
     began to assess the possible economic fallout from the U.S. presidential
     election, which, like Brexit five months earlier, produced a surprising
     result with Donald Trump's victory. Bank loans still produced positive
     performance for the month of November, however, and generated a 7.76%
     return over the full 12-month period. Meanwhile, investor confidence
     received a boost from the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) report for the
     third quarter, which showed a significant upturn from the second quarter's
     GDP data. In the third quarter, U.S. GDP grew at a rate exceeding 3%, more
     than double the 1.4% rate in the second quarter. This announcement,
     combined with evidence of continued gains in domestic employment and
     improvements in wage growth, encouraged market confidence that the U.S.
     Federal Reserve System (the Fed) - in line with earlier expectations -
     would raise short-term interest rates in December 2016, approximately one
     year after beginning its tightening cycle with a small hike in the Federal
     funds rate in December 2015.

Q    Which of your investment decisions had the biggest effects on the Trust's
     benchmark-relative performance during the 12-month period ended November
     30, 2016?

A    The Trust participated in the rally that began in February 2016, although
     benchmark-relative performance was negatively affected by the generally
     higher-quality composition of the holdings in the Trust's portfolio as
     compared with the components of the S&P/LSTA Index, as lower-quality loans
     outperformed higher-quality loans during the period. However,
     benchmark-relative performance, inclusive of leverage, was solid during the
     period. The use of leverage, or borrowed funds, through a credit facility
     increases risk and has the effect of amplifying the size of market swings
     on the portfolio. Just as the use of leverage can exaggerate negative
     results during market downturns - as was the case during the first three
     months of the Trust's fiscal year when prices of higher-yielding securities
     declined - leverage can also enhance gains when prices of high-yield
     securities rise, as they did over the final nine months of the period.

     In addition, positive security selection results and the portfolio's
     moderate underweight in business equipment and services loans helped the
     Trust's benchmark-relative performance during the period, as did a moderate
     underweighting of loans to retailers. However, the portfolio's moderate
     underweight in loans to the oil and gas industry, during a period that saw
     the group outperform due to rallying oil prices, detracted from the Trust's
     benchmark-relative results.

     Security selection results within the portfolio's holdings of oil and gas
     industry loans also detracted from the Trust's benchmark-relative
     performance, as did a moderate underweight to loans in the information
     technology (IT) sector, though security selection within IT made a positive
     contribution to the Trust's benchmark-relative returns.

     With regard to individual investments, portfolio holdings that contributed
     positively to the Trust's benchmark-relative performance during the period
     included loans to Jonah Energy, an independent natural gas producer,
     Skillsoft, a software company specializing in programs for corporate human
     resources and training applications, and Fortesque, a mining company. In
     addition, holdings of loans to Affinion, a marketing services firm
     specializing in programs targeted to members of specific affinity groups,
     and to Scientific Games International, a producer of gambling and lottery
     equipment, aided the Trust's benchmark-relative returns during the period.

     Individual portfolio holdings that detracted from the Trust's benchmark-
     relative results during the period included loans to Dixie Electric, Targus
     Group, Medical Card Systems, CSM Bakery, and Community Health. Dixie
     provides electrical services to oil field operators. Targus is a producer
     of

6 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16
<PAGE>

     protective cases and other accessories for electronic devices. Medical Card
     Systems is a health insurance company operating in Puerto Rico. CSM
     produces ingredients for the baking industry, and Community Health is a
     hospital-operating firm.

Q    How did the level of leverage in the Trust change over the 12-month period
     ended November 30, 2016?

A    The Trust employs leverage through a credit agreement. (See Note 7 to the
     financial statements).

     At the end of the 12-month period on November 30, 2016, 31.7% of the
     Trust's total managed assets were financed by leverage (or borrowed funds),
     compared with 33.1% of the Trust's total managed assets financed by
     leverage at the start of the period on December 1, 2015. During the
     12-month period, the Trust reduced borrowing from the credit facility by a
     total of $7 million, to $143 million as of November 30, 2016. Due to a
     decline in prices of bank loans in the first three months of the period, a
     reduction in the overall borrowing on the credit line was necessary in
     order to maintain the asset coverage requirements specified by the credit
     agreement. The percentage of the Trust's managed assets financed by
     leverage decreased during the period due to the reduction of borrowings.

Q    Did the Trust invest in any derivative securities during the 12-month
     period ended November 30, 2016? If so, did the investments have an effect
     on performance?

A    The Trust had a small exposure to Markit CDX (a high-yield, index-based
     credit-default swap) during the 12-month period, as a means to give the
     portfolio greater access to the high-yield market, while maintaining
     liquidity. The investment did not have a material impact on the Trust's
     performance.

Q    What factors affected the Trust's distributions to shareholders during the
     12-month period ended November 30, 2016?

A    The Trust's distributions were stable during the period. Shareholders
     should be aware, however, that several factors could affect future
     distributions. As older loans with higher yields are called back to be
     refinanced at lower rates, newer loans in the Trust's portfolio may pay
     less current income to the Trust.

     Potentially offsetting these influences is the prospect that short-term
     interest rates will begin increasing due to tightening of monetary policy
     by the Fed. If there are multiple rate increases by the Fed over the next
     several

                        Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16 7
<PAGE>

     months, the income paid by floating-rate loans may also start increasing,
     which could result in greater current income for the Trust, as rates could
     exceed the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) floors in the portfolio.

Q    What is your investment outlook?

A    We think the prospects for investments in floating-rate bank loans are
     good, especially in an expanding domestic economy, and with loan default
     rates at well below long-term averages.

     The recent announcement by the U.S. Labor Department that GDP growth
     accelerated to greater than 3% in the third quarter of 2016 points to a
     strengthening economy. Moreover, President-Elect Trump's policy proposals
     during the campaign included his expressed desire to boost government
     spending on infrastructure. If such spending occurs, that could stimulate
     further economic growth and improve the prospects for credit-linked debt,
     including bank loans.

     In December 2016, right after the end of the 12-month period, the Fed
     increased the Federal funds rate for the first time in a year and for just
     the second time in eight years. Strong economic data reports lend support
     to the likelihood that the Fed will follow-up its December 2016 rate hike
     with further increases. We expect the Fed to enact possibly two more
     interest-rate increases during 2017. Such a development could lead to
     rising LIBOR rates, and that, in turn, could result in higher dividends*
     paid by floating-rate loans.

     Investors should be aware, however, that while the yield potential for bank
     loans may improve, the potential for significant capital appreciation of
     bank-loan investments appears limited, given that more than half the
     floating-rate loans in the S&P/LSTA Index currently trade at prices above
     par (face) value.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 13-42 for a full listing of
Trust securities.

All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal.
In the past several years, financial markets have experienced increased
volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity, and heightened
uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen, or spread.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency
exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to attempt
to increase the Trust's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered
speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. Using derivatives can
increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when the market prices,
interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves behave in a way not
anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can increase price
fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities which may be less liquid or
illiquid. Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of
their value at times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the
market price of illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of more
liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and investment
of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to
take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage creates
significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital
appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage will not
be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
return for shareowners.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment
portfolio or take other actions at what might be inopportune times in the
market. Such actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners
over time, which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the
Trust's shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit us.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.
There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds
are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently
trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per share is total assets less total
liabilities, which include preferred shares, or borrowings, as applicable,
divided by the number of shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained through open-market purchases under
the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and,
unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. The
indices do not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

***  The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Bloomberg Barclays
     Index) was the Trust's benchmark from inception through 9/30/16, when the
     Bloomberg Barclays Index ceased. As of 10/1/16, the Trust's benchmark is
     the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the S&P/LSTA Index). Both the Bloomberg
     Barclays Index and the S&P/LSTA Index provide broad and comprehensive total
     return metrics of the U.S. universe of syndicated term loans.

Notes to Financial Statements | 11/30/16

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The investment
objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income and the
Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the
extent consistent with its investment objective of high current income.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) that require the management
of the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income,
expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

The Trust is an investment company and follows investment company accounting and
reporting guidance under U.S. GAAP. The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial
statements:

A.   Security Valuation

     The net asset value of the Trust is computed once daily, on each day the
     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open, as of the close of regular trading
     on the NYSE.

     Fixed income securities are valued by using prices supplied by independent
     pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices, market
     events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
     maturities and ratings, or may use a pricing matrix or other fair value
     methods or techniques to provide an estimated value of the security or
     instrument. A pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on the
     basis of current market prices for other debt securities, historical
     trading patterns in the market for fixed income securities and/or other
     factors. Non-U.S. debt securities that are listed on an exchange will be
     valued at the bid price obtained from an independent third party pricing
     service. When independent third party pricing services are unable to supply
     prices, or when prices or market quotations are considered to be
     unreliable, the value of that security may be determined using quotations
     from one or more broker-dealers.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16 49
<PAGE>

     Loan interests are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the
     Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked
     prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing
     Corporation, an independent third party pricing service. If price
     information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation, or if the price
     information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be obtained
     from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable price
     quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing
     service, broker quotes will be solicited.

     Event-linked bonds or catastrophe bonds are valued at the bid price
     obtained from an independent third party pricing service. Other insurance
     linked securities (including sidecars, collateralized reinsurance and
     industry loss warranties) may be valued at the bid price obtained from an
     independent pricing service, or through a third party using a pricing
     matrix, insurance industry valuation models, or other fair value methods or
     techniques to provide an estimated value of the instrument.

     Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are valued by using the
     last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Equity
     securities that have not traded on the date of valuation, or securities for
     which sale prices are not available, generally are valued using the mean
     between the last bid and asked prices or, if both last bid and asked prices
     are not available, at the last quoted bid price. Last sale and bid and
     asked prices are provided by independent third party pricing services. In
     the case of equity securities not traded on an exchange, prices are
     typically determined by independent third party pricing services using a
     variety of techniques and methods.

     The value of foreign securities is translated into U.S. dollars based on
     foreign currency exchange rate quotations supplied by a third party pricing
     source. Trading in non-U.S. equity securities is substantially completed
     each day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of
     such securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares
     are determined as of such times. The Trust may use a fair value model
     developed by an independent pricing service to value non-U.S. equity
     securities.

     Swap contracts, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors (other than
     centrally cleared swap contracts) are valued at the dealer quotations
     obtained from reputable International Swap Dealers Association members.
     Centrally cleared swaps are valued at the daily settlement price provided
     by the central clearing counterparty.

     Shares of open-end registered investment companies (including money market
     mutual funds) are valued at such funds' net asset value. Repurchase
     agreements are valued at par. Cash may include overnight time deposits at
     approved financial institutions.

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16
<PAGE>

     Securities or loan interests for which independent pricing services or
     broker-dealers are unable to supply prices or for which market prices
     and/or quotations are not readily available or are considered to be
     unreliable are valued by a fair valuation team comprised of certain
     personnel of Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM), the Trust's
     investment adviser and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A.
     (UniCredit), pursuant to procedures adopted by the Trust's Board of
     Trustees. PIM's fair valuation team uses fair value methods approved by the
     Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees. PIM's fair valuation team is
     responsible for monitoring developments that may impact fair valued
     securities and for discussing and assessing fair values on an ongoing
     basis, and at least quarterly, with the Valuation Committee of the Board of
     Trustees.

     Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may
     include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
     market conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value
     methods if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after the
     close of the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior to
     the determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a significant
     event might include political or economic news, corporate restructurings,
     natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts. Thus, the valuation
     of the Trust's securities may differ significantly from exchange prices and
     such differences could be material.

     At November 30, 2016, three securities were valued using fair value methods
     (in addition to securities valued using prices supplied by independent
     pricing services, broker-dealers or using a third party insurance pricing
     model) representing 0.27% of net assets. The value of these fair valued
     securities are $822,456.

B.   Investment Income and Transactions

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
     dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
     passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
     data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Interest income, including
     interest on income bearing cash accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis.
     Dividend and interest income are reported net of unrecoverable foreign
     taxes withheld at the applicable country rates.

     Discounts and premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted
     or amortized, respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective
     yield to maturity basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the
     cost basis of the security. Premiums and discounts related to certain
     mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the
     monthly paydowns.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16 51
<PAGE>

     Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Gains and losses on
     sales of investments are calculated on the identified cost method for both
     financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.   Foreign Currency Translation

     The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
     denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
     current exchange rates.

     Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
     represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
     currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
     between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually
     received. Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
     rates on investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from
     the effects of changes in the market price of those securities but are
     included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

D.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

     The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
     the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
     future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
     exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation
     are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records
     realized gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by entry into a
     closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may
     arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of
     counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated
     movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
     During the year ended November 30, 2016, the Trust did not enter into any
     forward foreign currency contracts.

E.   Federal Income Taxes

     It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
     all of its net taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to
     its shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. As
     of November 30, 2016, the Trust did not accrue any interest or penalties
     with respect to uncertain tax positions, which if applicable, would be
     recorded as an income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. Tax
     returns filed within the prior three years remain subject to examination by
     federal and state tax authorities.

52 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16
<PAGE>

     The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
     shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
     which may differ from U.S. GAAP. Distributions in excess of net investment
     income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions for financial
     statement and tax purposes. Capital accounts within the financial
     statements are adjusted for permanent book/tax differences to reflect tax
     character, but are not adjusted for temporary differences.

     At November 30, 2016, The Trust reclassified $27,976,877 to decrease
     paid-in capital, $1,185,635 to decrease undistributed net investment income
     and $29,162,512 to decrease accumulated net realized loss on investments to
     reflect permanent book/tax differences. These adjustments have no impact on
     the net assets or results of operations.

     At November 30, 2016, the Trust was permitted to carry forward $1,309,699
     of short-term capital losses and $30,753,104 of long-term capital losses
     without limitation. Additionally, at November 30, 2016, the Trust had a net
     capital loss carry forward of $92,625,503 of which the following amounts
     will expire between 2016 and 2019 if not utilized: $62,461,978 in 2017,
     $11,415,660 in 2018, and $18,747,865 in 2019. Since unlimited losses are
     required to be used first, loss carry forwards that are subject to
     expiration may be more likely to expire unused.

     The Trust has elected to defer $1,562,106 of long-term capital losses
     recognized between June 1, 2016 and November 30, 2016 to its fiscal year
     ending November 30, 2017.

     The tax character of distributions paid to shareowners during the years
     ended November 30, 2016 and November 30, 2015 were as follows:

     The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
     primarily attributable to the realization for tax purposes of unrealized
     gains on investments in passive foreign investment companies, the book/tax
     differences in the accrual of income on securities in default, the
     difference between book and tax amortization methods and discounts on fixed
     income securities.

F.   Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS)

     The Trust invests in event-linked bonds. Event-linked bonds are floating
     rate debt obligations for which the return of principal and the payment of
     interest are contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger"
     event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. The
     trigger event's magnitude may be based on losses to a company or industry,
     industry indexes or readings of scientific instruments, or may be based on
     specified actual losses. If a trigger event occurs, as defined within the
     terms of an event-linked bond, the Trust may lose a portion or all of its
     accrued interest and/or principal invested in such event-linked bond. The
     Trust is entitled to receive principal and interest payments so long as no
     trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude specified by the
     instrument. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked bonds
     may expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
     (credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
     adverse tax consequences.

     The Trust's investments in ILS may include special purpose vehicles
     ("SPVs") or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a
     reinsurer's catastrophe-oriented business, known as quota share instruments
     (sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars), or to provide reinsurance
     relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a
     collateralized instrument, known as collateralized reinsurance. Structured
     reinsurance investments also may include industry loss warranties ("ILWs").
     A traditional ILW takes the form of a bilateral reinsurance contract, but
     there are also products that take the form of derivatives, collateralized
     structures, or exchange traded instruments.

     Structured reinsurance investments, including quota share instruments,
     collateralized reinsurance investments and ILWs generally are subject to
     the same risks as event-linked bonds. In addition, where the instruments
     are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance contracts, the Trust
     has limited transparency into the individual underlying contracts and
     therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and sound underwriting
     practices of the issuer. Accordingly, it may be more difficult for PIM to
     fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of the Trust's structured
     reinsurance investments and therefore the Trust's assets are placed at
     greater risk of loss than if PIM had more complete information. Structured
     reinsurance instruments generally will be considered illiquid securities by
     the Trust. These securities may be

54 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16
<PAGE>

     difficult to purchase, sell or unwind. Illiquid securities also may be
     difficult to value. If the Trust is forced to sell an illiquid asset, the
     Trust may be forced to sell at a loss.

G.   Risks

     Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the
     Trust's original offering prospectus, with additional information included
     in the Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to
     those documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the
     Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are
     interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any
     economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting
     those industries and sectors.

     The value of securities held by the Trust may go up or down, sometimes
     rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real or
     perceived adverse economic, political or regulatory conditions, inflation,
     changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse
     investor sentiment. In the past several years, financial markets have
     experienced increased volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity
     and heightened uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen or
     spread.

     The Trust invests in below investment grade (high yield) debt securities,
     floating rate loans and event-linked bonds sometimes referred to as
     "catastrophe" bonds or "insurance-linked" bonds. The Trust may invest in
     securities and other obligations of any credit quality, including those
     that are rated below investment grade, or are unrated but are determined by
     the investment adviser to be of equivalent credit quality. Below investment
     grade securities are commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are
     considered speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay
     interest and repay principal. Below investment grade securities, including
     floating rate loans, involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater
     price volatility, and are less liquid and more difficult to value,
     especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher
     rated debt securities. Certain securities in which the Trust invests,
     including floating rate loans, once sold, may not settle for an extended
     period (for example, several weeks or even longer). The Trust will not
     receive its sale proceeds until that time, which may constrain the Trust's
     ability to meet its obligations. The Trust may invest in securities of
     issuers that are in default or that are in bankruptcy. The value of
     collateral, if any, securing a floating rate loan can decline or may be
     insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations or may be difficult to
     liquidate. No active trading market may exist for many floating rate loans,
     and many loans are subject to restrictions on resale. Any secondary market
     may be subject to irregular trading activity and extended settlement
     periods. The Trust's investments in

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16 55
<PAGE>

     certain foreign markets or countries with limited developing markets may
     subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a developed market.
     These risks include disruptive political or economic conditions and the
     possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency exchange
     restrictions.

     Interest rates in the U.S. recently have been historically low, so the
     Trust faces a heightened risk that interest rates may rise. A general rise
     in interest rates may cause investors to move out of fixed income
     securities on a large scale, which could adversely affect the price and
     liquidity of fixed income securities.

H.   Repurchase Agreements

     Repurchase agreements are arrangements under which the Trust purchases
     securities from a broker-dealer or a bank, called the counterparty, upon
     the agreement of the counterparty to repurchase the securities from the
     Trust at a later date, and at a specific price, which is typically higher
     than the purchase price paid by the Trust. The securities purchased serve
     as the Trust's collateral for the obligation of the counterparty to
     repurchase the securities. The value of the collateral, including accrued
     interest, is required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price.
     The collateral for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the
     customer-only account of the Trust's custodian or a subcustodian of the
     Trust. PIM is responsible for determining that the value of the collateral
     remains at least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of a default
     by the counterparty, the Trust is entitled to sell the securities, but the
     Trust may not be able to sell them for the price at which they were
     purchased, thus causing a loss to the Trust. Additionally, if the
     counterparty becomes insolvent, there is some risk that the Trust will not
     have a right to the securities, or the immediate right to sell the
     securities. Open repurchase agreements as of November 30, 2016 are
     disclosed in the Trust's Schedule of Investments.

I.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
     automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
     Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
     distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional shares of
     the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
     Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
     capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely
     voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by
     notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for
     shareowners in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to
     any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be
     effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other
     distribution.

56 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16
<PAGE>

     If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
     other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
     the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
     the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A
     firm or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in shares of the
     Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

     Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on shares payable in cash,
     participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares acquired by
     the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
     authorized shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares
     on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for
     any dividend, the net asset value per share is equal to or less than the
     market price per share plus estimated brokerage trading fees (market
     premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
     shares. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to each account
     will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net
     asset value per share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the
     maximum discount from the then current market price per share on the date
     of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend,
     the net asset value per share is greater than the market value (market
     discount), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares
     acquired in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges with
     respect to newly issued shares. However, each participant will pay a pro
     rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan
     Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve
     shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be due on
     dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a
     brokerage account may be able to transfer the shares to another broker and
     continue to participate in the Plan.

J.   Credit Default Swap Agreements

     A credit default swap is a contract between a buyer of protection and a
     seller of protection against a pre-defined credit event on an underlying
     reference obligation, which may be a single security or a basket or index
     of securities. The Trust may buy or sell credit default swap contracts to
     seek to increase the Trust's income, or to attempt to hedge the risk of
     default on portfolio securities. A credit default swap index is used to
     hedge risk or take a position on a basket of credit entities or indices. As
     a seller of protection, the Trust would be required to pay the notional (or
     other agreed-upon) value of the referenced debt obligation to the
     counterparty in the event of a default by a U.S. or foreign corporate
     issuer of a debt obligation, which would likely result in a loss to the
     Trust. In return, the Trust would receive from the counterparty a periodic
     stream of payments during the term of the contract

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16 57
<PAGE>

     provided that no event of default occurred. The maximum exposure of loss to
     the seller would be the notional value of the credit default swaps
     outstanding. If no default occurs, the Trust would keep the stream of
     payments and would have no payment obligation. The Trust may also buy
     credit default swap contracts in order to hedge against the risk of default
     of debt securities, in which case the Trust would function as the
     counterparty referenced above.

     When the Trust enters into a credit default swap contract, the protection
     buyer makes an upfront or periodic payment to the protection seller in
     exchange for the right to receive a contingent payment. An upfront payment
     made by the Trust, as the protection buyer, is recorded as an asset in the
     Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Periodic payments received or paid by
     the Trust are recorded as realized gains or losses in the Statement of
     Operations.

     Credit default swap contracts are marked-to-market daily using valuations
     supplied by independent sources and the change in value, if any, is
     recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of
     Assets and Liabilities. Payments received or made as a result of a credit
     event or upon termination of the contract are recognized, net of the
     appropriate amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses in
     the Statement of Operations.

     Credit default swap contracts involving the sale of protection may involve
     greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the referenced debt
     instrument directly. Credit default swap contracts are subject to general
     market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the
     Trust is a protection buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its
     investment. If the Trust is a protection seller and a credit event occurs,
     the value of the referenced debt instrument received by the Trust, together
     with the periodic payments received, may be less than the amount the Trust
     pays to the protection buyer, resulting in a loss to the Trust.

     Certain swap contracts that are cleared through a central clearinghouse are
     referred to as centrally cleared swaps. All payments made or received by
     the Trust are pursuant to a centrally cleared swap contract with the
     central clearing party rather than the original counterparty. Upon entering
     into a centrally cleared swap contract, the Trust is required to make an
     initial margin deposit, either in cash or in securities. The daily change
     in value on open centrally cleared contracts is recorded as variation
     margin on centrally cleared swaps on the Statement of Assets and
     Liabilities.

     The amount of cash deposited with the broker as collateral at November 30,
     2016, and is included in "Restricted cash" in the Statement of Assets and
     Liabilities, was $200,000.

58 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16
<PAGE>

     Open credit default swap contracts at November 30, 2016 are listed in the
     Schedule of Investments. The average market value of swap contracts open
     during the year ended November 30, 2016 was $89,423.

2. Management Agreement

PIM manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's
Advisory Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of
the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall not
include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation,
borrowing through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities), (ii)
the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or
(iii) any other means. For the year ended November 30, 2016, the net management
fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent
to 1.03% of the Trust's average daily net assets.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At November 30,
2016, $379,131 was payable to PIM related to management costs, administrative
costs and certain other services is included in "Due to affiliates" and
"Administration fee" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

3. Transfer Agent

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (AST) serves as the transfer agent with
respect to the Trust's shares. The Trust pays AST an annual fee, as is agreed to
from time to time by the Trust and AST, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimbursed the transfer agent for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the transfer agent related to shareowner communications activities
such as proxy and statement mailings and outgoing calls.

4. Additional Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Trust's use of derivatives subjects it to the following risks:

Interest rate risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of interest-bearing
securities due to changes in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.

Credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer of a financial instrument to
make further principal or interest payments on an obligation or commitment that
it has to the Trust.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16 59
<PAGE>

Foreign exchange rate risk relates to fluctuations in the value of an asset or
liability due to changes in currency exchange rates.

Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as
a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest
rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether caused by factors specific to an
individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all instruments
traded in a market or market segment.

Commodity risk relates to the risk that the value of a commodity or commodity
index will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in the commodities market
and factors specific to a particular industry or commodity.

instruments for accounting disclosure purposes) by risk exposure at November 30,

5. Unfunded Loan Commitments

The Trust may enter into unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded loan commitments
may be partially or wholly unfunded. During the contractual period, the Trust is
obligated to provide funding to the borrower upon demand. A fee is earned by the
Trust on the unfunded commitment and is recorded as interest income in the
Statement of Operations.

As of November 30, 2016, the Trust had the following unfunded loan commitments
outstanding:

7. Credit Agreement

Effective November 26, 2013, the Trust entered into a Revolving Credit Facility
(the Credit Agreement) with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of
$160,000,000. The Credit Agreement was established in conjunction with the
redemption of all the Trust's auction market preferred shares. Effective
November 23, 2016, the Trust extended the maturity of the Credit Agreement for a
364 day period.

At November 30, 2016, the Trust had borrowings outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaling $143,450,000. The interest rate charged at November 30, 2016
was 1.38%. During the year ended November 30, 2016, the average daily balance
was $144,279,268 at an average interest rate of 1.33%. Interest expense of
$1,924,262 in connection with the Credit Agreement is included in the Statement
of Operations. The fair value of the outstanding balance of the Credit Agreement
at November 30, 2016 approximates its carrying value.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16 61
<PAGE>

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Asset coverage is calculated by
subtracting the Trust's total liabilities not including any bank loans and
senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such amount by the
principal amount of the borrowing outstanding.

8. Subsequent Event

A monthly dividend was declared on December 2, 2016 from undistributed and
accumulated net investment income of $0.0600 per share payable December 19,
2016, to shareowners of record on December 14, 2016.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Trustees and the Shareowners of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust"), as of
November 30, 2016, and the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
three years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits. The financial highlights for the years ended November 30,
2013, and 2012, were audited by other auditors. Those auditors expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial highlights in
their report dated January 24, 2014.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Trust
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of November 30, 2016, by correspondence with the
custodian, brokers and agent banks; where replies were not received from brokers
and agent banks, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust as of November 30, 2016, the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the three years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

During the period, there have been no material changes in the Trust's investment
objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which has not been
approved by the shareowners. During the period, there have been no changes in
the principal risk factors associated with investment in the Trust. There were
no changes in the persons who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Trust's portfolio.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its shares
in the open market.

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (the "Adviser"), the Trust's investment
adviser, is currently an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of UniCredit. On
December 12, 2016, UniCredit announced that it has entered into a binding
agreement for the sale of its Pioneer Investments business, which includes the
Adviser, to Amundi (the "Transaction"). Amundi is headquartered in Paris,
France, and, as of September 30, 2016, had more than $1.1 trillion in assets
under management worldwide. The closing of the Transaction is expected to happen
in 2017, subject to certain regulatory and antitrust approvals, and other
conditions.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the closing of the Transaction will
cause the Trust's current investment advisory agreement with the Adviser to
terminate. Accordingly, the Trust's Board of Trustees will be asked to approve a
new investment advisory agreement for the Trust. If approved by the Board, the
Trust's new investment advisory agreement will be submitted to the shareholders
of the Trust for their approval.

Approval of Investment Advisory Agreement

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM) serves as the investment adviser to
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) pursuant to an investment advisory
agreement between PIM and the Trust. In order for PIM to remain the investment
adviser of the Trust, the Trustees of the Trust must determine annually whether
to renew the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

The contract review process began in January 2016 as the Trustees of the Trust
agreed on, among other things, an overall approach and timeline for the process.
Contract review materials were provided to the Trustees in March 2016 and May
2016. In addition, the Trustees reviewed and discussed the Trust's performance
at regularly scheduled meetings throughout the year and took into account other
information related to the Trust provided to the Trustees at regularly scheduled
meetings in connection with the review of the Trust's investment advisory
agreement.

In March 2016, the Trustees, among other things, discussed the memorandum
provided by Trust counsel that summarized the legal standards and other
considerations that are relevant to the Trustees in their deliberations
regarding the renewal of the investment advisory agreement, and reviewed and
discussed the qualifications of the investment management teams, as well as the
level of investment by the Trust's portfolio manager in the Trust. In May 2016,
the Trustees, among other things, reviewed the Trust's management fee and total
expense ratios, the financial statements of PIM and its parent companies, the
profitability analyses provided by PIM, and possible economies of scale. The
Trustees also reviewed the profitability of the institutional business of PIM
and PIM's affiliate, Pioneer Institutional Asset Management, Inc. (together with
PIM, "Pioneer"), as compared to that of PIM's fund management business, and
considered the differences between the fees and expenses of the Trust and the
fees and expenses of Pioneer's institutional accounts, as well as the different
services provided by PIM to the Trust and by Pioneer to the institutional
accounts. The Trustees further considered contract review materials in July and
September 2016.

At a meeting held on September 13, 2016, based on their evaluation of the
information provided by PIM and third parties, the Trustees of the Trust,
including the Independent Trustees voting separately, unanimously approved the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for another year. In approving the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement, the Trustees considered various
factors that they determined were relevant, including the factors described
below. The Trustees did not identify any single factor as the controlling factor
in determining to approve the renewal of the agreement.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services

The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services that had
been provided by PIM to the Trust, taking into account the investment objective
and strategy of the Trust. The Trustees also reviewed PIM's investment approach
for the Trust and its research process. The Trustees considered the resources of
PIM and the personnel of PIM who provide investment management services to the
Trust. They also reviewed the amount of non-Trust assets managed by the
portfolio manager of the Trust. The Trustees considered the non-investment
resources and personnel of PIM involved in PIM's services to the Trust,
including PIM's compliance and legal resources and personnel. The Trustees noted
the substantial attention and high priority given by PIM's senior management to
the Pioneer fund complex.

The Trustees considered that PIM supervises and monitors the performance of the
Trust's service providers and provides the Trust with personnel (including Trust
officers) and other resources that are necessary for the Trust's business
management and operations. The Trustees also considered that, as administrator,
PIM is responsible for the administration of the Trust's business and other
affairs. The Trustees considered the fees paid to PIM for the provision of
administration services.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services that had been provided by PIM to the Trust were
satisfactory and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory agreement.

Performance of the Trust

In considering the Trust's performance, the Trustees regularly review and
discuss throughout the year data prepared by PIM and information comparing the
Trust's performance with the performance of its peer group of funds as
classified by each of Morningstar, Inc. (Morningstar) and Lipper, and with the
performance of the Trust's benchmark index. They also discuss the Trust's
performance with PIM on a regular basis. The Trustees' regular reviews and
discussions were factored into the Trustees' deliberations concerning the
renewal of the advisory agreement.

Management Fee and Expenses

The Trustees considered information showing the fees and expenses of the Trust
in comparison to the management fees and the expense ratios of a peer group of
funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the Independent Trustees
for this purpose using data provided by Strategic Insight Mutual Fund Research
and Consulting, LLC (Strategic Insight), an independent third party. In all
quintile rankings referred to below, first quintile is most favorable to the
Trust's shareowners.

<PAGE>

The Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee (based on managed
assets) for the most recent fiscal year was in the first quintile relative to
the management fees paid by other funds in its Strategic Insight peer group for
the comparable period. The Trustees considered that the expense ratio (based on
managed assets) of the Trust's common shares for the most recent fiscal year was
in the first quintile relative to its Strategic Insight peer group for the
comparable period.

The Trustees reviewed management fees charged by Pioneer to institutional and
other clients, including publicly offered European funds sponsored by affiliates
of Pioneer, unaffiliated U.S. registered investment companies (in a sub-advisory
capacity), and unaffiliated foreign and domestic separate accounts. The Trustees
also considered PIM's costs in providing services to the Trust and Pioneer's
costs in providing services to the other clients and considered the differences
in management fees and profit margins for Trust and non-Trust services. In
evaluating the fees associated with Pioneer's client accounts, the Trustees took
into account the respective demands, resources and complexity associated with
the Trust and client accounts. The Trustees noted that, in some instances, the
fee rates for those clients were lower than the management fee for the Trust and
considered that, under the investment advisory agreement with the Trust, PIM
performs additional services for the Trust that it does not provide to those
other clients or services that are broader in scope, including oversight of the
Trust's other service providers and activities related to compliance and the
extensive regulatory and tax regimes to which the Trust is subject. The Trustees
also considered the different entrepreneurial risks associated with PIM's
management of the Trust and Pioneer's management of the other client accounts.

The Trustees concluded that the management fee payable by the Trust to PIM was
reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services provided by PIM
to the Trust.

Profitability

The Trustees considered information provided by PIM regarding the profitability
of PIM with respect to the advisory services provided by PIM to the Trust,
including the methodology used by PIM in allocating certain of its costs to the
management of the Trust. The Trustees also considered PIM's profit margin in
connection with the overall operation of the Trust. They further reviewed the
financial results, including the profit margins, realized by PIM and its
affiliates from non-fund businesses. The Trustees considered PIM's profit
margins with respect to the Trust in comparison to the limited industry data
available and noted that the profitability of any adviser was affected by

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/16 67
<PAGE>

numerous factors, including its organizational structure and method for
allocating expenses. The Trustees concluded that PIM's profitability with
respect to the management of the Trust was not unreasonable.

Economies of Scale

The Trustees considered the extent to which PIM may realize economies of scale
or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the Trust. Since the Trust is a
closed-end fund that has not raised additional capital, the Trustees concluded
that economies of scale were not a relevant consideration in the renewal of the
investment advisory agreement.

Other Benefits

The Trustees considered the other benefits to PIM from its relationship with the
Trust. The Trustees considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
Trust, other than under the investment advisory agreement, for services provided
by PIM and its affiliates. The Trustees further considered the revenues and
profitability of PIM's businesses other than the fund business. Pioneer is the
principal U.S. asset management business of Pioneer Global Asset Management, the
worldwide asset management business of UniCredit Group, which manages over $150
billion in assets (including the Funds). Pioneer and the Funds receive
reciprocal intangible benefits from the relationship, including mutual brand
recognition and, for the Funds, direct and indirect access to the resources of a
large global asset manager. The Trustees concluded that any such benefits
received by Pioneer as a result of its relationship with the Funds were
reasonable and their consideration of the advisory agreement between the Trust
and PIM and the fees thereunder were unaffected by Pioneer's possible receipt of
any such intangible benefits.

Conclusion

After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors, the
Trustees, including all of the Independent Trustees, concluded that the
investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust, including the fees
payable thereunder, was fair and reasonable and voted to approve the proposed
renewal of the investment advisory agreement for the Trust.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                 firm, the scope of the Audit

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered
into on or after May 6, 2003, the effective date of the
new SEC pre-approval rules, the Trust's audit
committee is required to pre-approve services to
affiliates defined by SEC rules to the extent that the
services are determined to have a direct impact on the
operations or financial reporting of the Trust.  For the
years ended Novemnber 30 2016 and 2015, there were no
services provided to an affiliate that required the
Trust's audit committee pre-approval.



(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountants engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrants accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrants
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The aggregate non-audit fees for the Trust were $9,904
payable to Deloitte & Touche LLP for the year ended
November 30, 2016 and $9,876 for the year ended November 30, 2015.


(h) Disclose whether the registrants audit committee of the board of trustees

investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Fund's audit committee of the Board of Trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit
services that were rendered to the Affiliates (as
defined) that were not pre- approved pursuant to
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

(a) If the registrant is a listed issuer as defined in Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3), state whether

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of
                       Pioneer Investment Management, Inc.

                            VERSION DATED July, 2004

                                    Overview

   Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer") is a fiduciary that owes
   each of its client's duties of care and loyalty with respect to all
   services undertaken on the client's behalf, including proxy voting. When
   Pioneer has been delegated proxy-voting authority for a client, the duty of
   care requires Pioneer to monitor corporate events and to vote the proxies.
   To satisfy its duty of loyalty, Pioneer must place its client's interests
   ahead of its own and must cast proxy votes in a manner consistent with the
   best interest of its clients. Pioneer will vote all proxies presented in a
   timely manner.

   The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are designed to complement
   Pioneer's investment policies and procedures regarding its general
   responsibility to monitor the performance and/or corporate events of
   companies that are issuers of securities held in accounts managed by
   Pioneer. Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies summarize Pioneer's position on a
   number of issues solicited by companies held by Pioneer's clients. The
   policies are guidelines that provide a general indication on how Pioneer
   would vote but do not include all potential voting scenarios.

   Pioneer's Proxy Voting Procedures detail monitoring of voting, exception
   votes, and review of conflicts of interest and ensure that case-by-case
   votes are handled within the context of the overall guidelines (i.e. best
   interest of client). The overriding goal is that all proxies for US and
   non-US companies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance
   with Pioneer's policies or specific client instructions. All shares in a
   company held by Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a
   client has given us specific voting instructions on an issue or has not
   delegated authority to us or the Proxy Voting Oversight Group determines
   that the circumstances justify a different approach.

   Pioneer does not delegate the authority to vote proxies relating to its
   clients to any of its affiliates, which include other subsidiaries of
   UniCredito.

   Any questions about these policies and procedures should be directed to the
   Proxy Coordinator.

                             Proxy Voting Procedures

   Proxy Voting Service
   Pioneer has engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
   voting of proxies. The proxy voting service works with custodians to ensure
   that all proxy materials are received by the custodians and are processed
   in a timely fashion. To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service
   votes all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting policies established
   by Pioneer. The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
   Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
   where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
   particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
   guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis. The
   proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
   attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
   appear to involve unusual or controversial issues. Pioneer reserves the
   right to attend a meeting in person and may do so when it determines that
   the company or the matters to be voted on at the meeting are strategically
   important to its clients.

   Proxy Coordinator
   Pioneer's Director of Investment Operations (the "Proxy Coordinator")
   coordinates the voting, procedures and reporting of proxies on behalf of
   Pioneer's clients. The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy
   voting service and, in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy
   voting service, will solicit voting recommendations and instructions from
   the Director of Portfolio Management US or, to the extent applicable,
   investment sub-advisers. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for ensuring
   that these questions and referrals are responded to in a timely fashion and
   for transmitting appropriate voting instructions to the proxy voting
   service. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for verifying with the
   Compliance Department whether Pioneer's voting power is subject to any
   limitations or guidelines issued by the client (or in the case of an
   employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries).

   Referral Items
   From time to time, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
   the Proxy Coordinator that are described by Pioneer's policy as to be voted
   on a case-by-case basis, that are not covered by Pioneer's guidelines or
   where Pioneer's guidelines may be unclear with respect to the matter to be
   voted on. Under such certain circumstances, the Proxy Coordinator will seek
   a written voting recommendation from the Director of Portfolio Management
   US. Any such recommendation will include: (i) the manner in which the
   proxies should be voted; (ii) the rationale underlying any such decision;
   and (iii) the disclosure of any contacts or communications made between
   Pioneer and any outside parties concerning the proxy proposal prior to the
   time that the voting instructions are provided. In addition, the Proxy
   Coordinator will ask the Compliance Department to review the question for
   any actual or apparent conflicts of interest as described below under
   "Conflicts of

                                       2
<PAGE>

   Interest." The Compliance Department will provide a "Conflicts of Interest
   Report," applying the criteria set forth below under "Conflicts of
   Interest," to the Proxy Coordinator summarizing the results of its review.
   In the absence of a conflict of interest, the Proxy Coordinator will vote
   in accordance with the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US.

   If the matter presents a conflict of interest for Pioneer, then the Proxy
   Coordinator will refer the matter to the Proxy Voting Oversight Group for a
   decision. In general, when a conflict of interest is present, Pioneer will
   vote according to the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US where such recommendation would go against Pioneer's interest
   or where the conflict is deemed to be immaterial. Pioneer will vote
   according to the recommendation of its proxy voting service when the
   conflict is deemed to be material and the Pioneer's internal vote
   recommendation would favor Pioneer's interest, unless a client specifically
   requests Pioneer to do otherwise. When making the final determination as to
   how to vote a proxy, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will review the
   report from the Director of Portfolio Management US and the Conflicts of
   Interest Report issued by the Compliance Department.

   Conflicts of Interest
   A conflict of interest occurs when Pioneer's interests interfere, or appear
   to interfere with the interests of Pioneer's clients. Occasionally, Pioneer
   may have a conflict that can affect how its votes proxies. The conflict may
   be actual or perceived and may exist when the matter to be voted on
   concerns:

       o      An affiliate of Pioneer,  such as another company  belonging to
              the UniCredito  Italiano  S.p.A.  banking group (a "UniCredito
              Affiliate");

       o      An issuer of a security for which Pioneer acts as a sponsor,
              advisor, manager, custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or
              other similar capacity (including those securities specifically
              declared by PGAM to present a conflict of interest for Pioneer);

       o      An issuer of a security for which UniCredito has informed Pioneer
              that a UniCredito Affiliate acts as a sponsor, advisor, manager,
              custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or other similar
              capacity; or

       o      A person with whom Pioneer (or any of its affiliates) has an
              existing, material contract or business relationship that was not
              entered into in the ordinary course of Pioneer's business.

       o      Pioneer will abstain from voting with respect to companies
              directly or indirectly owned by UniCredito Italiano Group, unless
              otherwise directed by a client. In addition, Pioneer will inform
              PGAM Global Compliance and the PGAM Independent Directors before
              exercising such rights.

   Any associate involved in the proxy voting process with knowledge of any
   apparent or actual conflict of interest must disclose such conflict to the
   Proxy Coordinator and the Compliance Department. The Compliance Department
   will review each item referred to Pioneer to determine whether an actual or
   potential conflict of interest with Pioneer exists in connection with the
   proposal(s) to be voted upon. The review will be conducted by comparing the
   apparent parties affected by the proxy proposal being

                                       3
<PAGE>

   voted upon against the Compliance Department's internal list of interested
   persons and, for any matches found, evaluating the anticipated magnitude
   and possible probability of any conflict of interest being present. For
   each referral item, the determination regarding the presence or absence of
   any actual or potential conflict of interest will be documented in a
   Conflicts of Interest Report to the Proxy Coordinator.

   Securities Lending
   In conjunction with industry standards Proxies are not available to be
   voted when the shares are out on loan through either Pioneer's lending
   program or a client's managed security lending program. However, Pioneer
   will reserve the right to recall lent securities so that they may be voted
   according to the Pioneer's instructions. If a portfolio manager would like
   to vote a block of previously lent shares, the Proxy Coordinator will work
   with the portfolio manager and Investment Operations to recall the
   security, to the extent possible, to facilitate the vote on the entire
   block of shares.

   Share-Blocking

   "Share-blocking" is a market practice whereby shares are sent to a
   custodian (which may be different than the account custodian) for record
   keeping and voting at the general meeting. The shares are unavailable for
   sale or delivery until the end of the blocking period (typically the day
   after general meeting date).

   Pioneer will vote in those countries with "share-blocking." In the event a
   manager would like to sell a security with "share-blocking", the Proxy
   Coordinator will work with the Portfolio Manager and Investment Operations
   Department to recall the shares (as allowable within the market time-frame
   and practices) and/or communicate with executing brokerage firm. A list of
   countries with "share-blocking" is available from the Investment Operations
   Department upon request.

   Record Keeping
   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that Pioneer's proxy voting service:

       o   Retains a copy of the proxy statement received (unless the proxy
           statement is available from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
           Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system);

       o   Retains a record of the vote cast;

       o   Prepares Form N-PX for filing on behalf of each client that is a
           registered investment company; and

       o   Is able to promptly provide Pioneer with a copy of the voting
           record upon its request.

                                       4
<PAGE>

   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that for those votes that may require
   additional documentation (i.e. conflicts of interest, exception votes and
   case-by-case votes) the following records are maintained:

       o    A record memorializing the basis for each referral vote cast;

       o    A copy of any document created by Pioneer that was material in
            making the decision on how to vote the subject proxy; and

       o    A copy of any conflict notice, conflict consent or any other
            written communication (including emails or other electronic
            communications) to or from the client (or in the case of an
            employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries)
            regarding the subject proxy vote cast by, or the vote
            recommendation of, Pioneer.

       o    Pioneer shall maintain the above records in the client's file for a
            period not less than ten (10) years.

     Disclosure
     Pioneer shall take reasonable measures to inform its clients of the process
     or procedures clients must follow to obtain information regarding how
     Pioneer voted with respect to assets held in their accounts. In addition,
     Pioneer shall describe to clients its proxy voting policies and procedures
     and will furnish a copy of its proxy voting policies and procedures upon
     request. This information may be provided to clients through Pioneer's Form
     ADV (Part II) disclosure, by separate notice to the client, or through
     Pioneer's website.

     Proxy Voting Oversight Group
     The members of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group are Pioneer's: Director of
     Portfolio Management US, Head of Investment Operations, and Director of
     Compliance. Other members of Pioneer will be invited to attend meetings and
     otherwise participate as necessary. The Head of Investment Operations will
     chair the Proxy Voting Oversight Group.

     The Proxy Voting Oversight Group is responsible for developing, evaluating,
     and changing (when necessary) Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies and
     Procedures. The group meets at least annually to evaluate and review these
     policies and procedures and the services of its third-party proxy voting
     service. In addition, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will meet as
     necessary to vote on referral items and address other business as
     necessary.

     Amendments
     Pioneer may not amend its Proxy Voting Policies And Procedures without the
     prior approval of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group and its corporate
     parent, Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A

                                       5

   Proxy Voting Policies
   Pioneer's sole concern in voting proxies is the economic effect of the
   proposal on the value of portfolio holdings, considering both the short-
   and long-term impact. In many instances, Pioneer believes that supporting
   the company's strategy and voting "for" management's proposals builds
   portfolio value. In other cases, however, proposals set forth by management
   may have a negative effect on that value, while some shareholder proposals
   may hold the best prospects for enhancing it. Pioneer monitors developments
   in the proxy-voting arena and will revise this policy as needed.

   All proxies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance with the
   specific policies listed below. All shares in a company held by
   Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a client has given us
   specific voting instructions on an issue or has not delegated authority to
   us. Proxy voting issues will be reviewed by Pioneer's Proxy Voting
   Oversight Group, which consists of the Director of Portfolio Management US,
   the Director of Investment Operations (the Proxy Coordinator), and the
   Director of Compliance.

   Pioneer has established Proxy Voting Procedures for identifying and
   reviewing conflicts of interest that may arise in the voting of proxies.

   Clients may request, at any time, a report on proxy votes for securities
   held in their portfolios and Pioneer is happy to discuss our proxy votes
   with company management. Pioneer retains a proxy voting service to provide
   research on proxy issues and to process proxy votes.

Administrative
   While administrative items appear infrequently in U.S. issuer proxies, they
   are quite common in non-U.S. proxies.

   We will generally support these and similar management proposals:

       o    Corporate name change.

       o    A change of corporate headquarters.

       o    Stock exchange listing.

       o    Establishment of time and place of annual meeting.

       o    Adjournment or postponement of annual meeting.

       o    Acceptance/approval of financial statements.

       o    Approval of dividend payments, dividend reinvestment plans and other
            dividend-related proposals.

       o    Approval of minutes and other formalities.

                                       6
<PAGE>

       o    Authorization of the transferring of reserves and allocation of
            income.

       o    Amendments to authorized signatories.

       o    Approval of accounting method changes or change in fiscal year-end.

       o    Acceptance of labor agreements.

       o    Appointment of internal auditors.

   Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case basis on other routine business;
   however, Pioneer will oppose any routine business proposal if insufficient
   information is presented in advance to allow Pioneer to judge the merit of
   the proposal. Pioneer has also instructed its proxy voting service to
   inform Pioneer of its analysis of any administrative items inconsistent, in
   its view, with supporting the value of Pioneer portfolio holdings so that
   Pioneer may consider and vote on those items on a case-by-case basis.

Auditors
     We normally vote for proposals to:

       o    Ratify the auditors. We will consider a vote against if we are
            concerned about the auditors' independence or their past work for
            the company. Specifically, we will oppose the ratification of
            auditors and withhold votes from audit committee members if
            non-audit fees paid by the company to the auditing firm exceed the
            sum of audit fees plus audit-related fees plus permissible tax
            fees according to the disclosure categories proposed by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission.

       o    Restore shareholder rights to ratify the auditors.

     We will normally oppose proposals that require companies to:

       o    Seek bids from other auditors.

       o    Rotate auditing firms, except where the rotation is statutorily
            required or where rotation would demonstrably strengthen financial
            disclosure.

       o    Indemnify auditors.

       o    Prohibit auditors from engaging in non-audit services for the
            company.

     Board of Directors
     On issues related to the board of directors, Pioneer normally supports
     management. We will, however, consider a vote against management in
     instances where corporate performance has been very poor or where the board
     appears to lack independence.

                                       7

     General Board Issues
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Audit, compensation and nominating committees composed of
            independent directors exclusively.

       o    Indemnification for directors for actions taken in good faith in
            accordance with the business judgment rule. We will vote against
            proposals for broader indemnification.

       o    Changes in board size that appear to have a legitimate business
            purpose and are not primarily for anti-takeover reasons.

       o    Election of an honorary director.

     We will vote against:

       o    Minimum stock ownership by directors.

       o    Term limits for directors. Companies benefit from experienced
            directors, and shareholder control is better achieved through
            annual votes.

       o    Requirements for union or special interest representation on the
            board.

       o    Requirements to provide two candidates for each board seat.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Separate chairman and CEO positions. We will consider voting with
            shareholders on these issues in cases of poor corporate
            performance.

     Elections of Directors
     In uncontested elections of directors we will vote against:

       o    Individual directors with absenteeism above 25% without valid
            reason. We support proposals that require disclosure of director
            attendance.

       o    Insider directors and affiliated outsiders who sit on the audit,
            compensation, stock option or nominating committees. For the
            purposes of our policy, we accept the definition of affiliated
            directors provided by our proxy voting service.

     We will also vote against:

       o    Directors who have failed to act on a takeover offer where the
            majority of shareholders have tendered their shares.

       o    Directors who appear to lack independence or are associated with
            very poor corporate performance.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Re-election of directors who have implemented or renewed a
            dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill (a "dead-hand poison
            pill" is a shareholder rights plan that may be altered only by
            incumbent or "dead " directors. These plans prevent a potential
            acquirer from disabling a poison pill by obtaining control of the
            board through a proxy vote).

       o    Contested election of directors.

       o    Prior to phase-in required by SEC, we would consider supporting
            election of a majority of independent directors in cases of poor
            performance.

       o    Mandatory retirement policies.

       o    Directors who have ignored a shareholder proposal that has been
            approved by shareholders for two consecutive years.

     Takeover-Related Measures
     Pioneer is generally opposed to proposals that may discourage takeover
     attempts. We believe that the potential for a takeover helps ensure that
     corporate performance remains high.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Cumulative voting.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to call special meetings.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to act by written consent.

       o    Restrictions on the ability to make greenmail payments.

       o    Submitting rights plans to shareholder vote.

       o    Rescinding shareholder rights plans ("poison pills").

       o    Opting out of the following state takeover statutes:

     o Control share acquisition statutes, which deny large holders voting
       rights on holdings over a specified threshold.

     o Control share cash-out provisions, which require large holders to
       acquire shares from other holders.

     o Freeze-out provisions, which impose a waiting period on large
       holders before they can attempt to gain control.

     o Stakeholder laws, which permit directors to consider interests of
       non-shareholder constituencies.

                                       9
<PAGE>

     o Disgorgement provisions, which require acquirers to disgorge profits
       on purchases made before gaining control.

     o Fair price provisions.

     o Authorization of shareholder rights plans.

     o Labor protection provisions.

     o Mandatory classified boards.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Fair price provisions. We will vote against provisions requiring
            supermajority votes to approve takeovers. We will also consider
            voting against proposals that require a supermajority vote to
            repeal or amend the provision. Finally, we will consider the
            mechanism used to determine the fair price; we are generally
            opposed to complicated formulas or requirements to pay a premium.

       o    Opting out of state takeover statutes regarding fair price
            provisions. We will use the criteria used for fair price
            provisions in general to determine our vote on this issue.

       o    Proposals that allow shareholders to nominate directors.

     We will vote against:

       o    Classified boards, except in the case of closed-end mutual funds.

       o    Limiting shareholder ability to remove or appoint directors. We
            will support proposals to restore shareholder authority in this
            area. We will review on a case-by-case basis proposals that
            authorize the board to make interim appointments.

       o    Classes of shares with unequal voting rights.

       o    Supermajority vote requirements.

       o    Severance packages ("golden" and "tin" parachutes). We will support
            proposals to put these packages to shareholder vote.

       o    Reimbursement of dissident proxy solicitation expenses. While we
            ordinarily support measures that encourage takeover bids, we
            believe that management should have full control over corporate
            funds.

       o    Extension of advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals.

       o    Granting board authority normally retained by shareholders (e.g.,
            amend charter, set board size).

       o    Shareholder rights plans ("poison pills"). These plans generally
            allow shareholders to buy additional shares at a below-market
            price in the event of a change in control and may deter some bids.

                                       10
<PAGE>

     Capital Structure
     Managements need considerable flexibility in determining the company's
     financial structure, and Pioneer normally supports managements' proposals
     in this area. We will, however, reject proposals that impose high barriers
     to potential takeovers.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Changes in par value.

       o    Reverse splits, if accompanied by a reduction in number of shares.

       o    Share repurchase programs, if all shareholders may participate on
            equal terms.

       o    Bond issuance.

       o    Increases in "ordinary" preferred stock.

       o    Proposals to have blank-check common stock placements (other than
            shares issued in the normal course of business) submitted for
            shareholder approval.

       o    Cancellation of company treasury shares.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Reverse splits not accompanied by a reduction in number of shares,
            considering the risk of delisting.

       o    Increase in authorized common stock. We will make a determination
            considering, among other factors:

     o Number of shares currently available for issuance;

     o Size of requested increase (we would normally approve increases of up to
       100% of current authorization);

     o Proposed use of the additional shares; and

     o Potential consequences of a failure to increase the number of shares
       outstanding (e.g., delisting or bankruptcy).

       o    Blank-check preferred. We will normally oppose issuance of a new
            class of blank-check preferred, but may approve an increase in a
            class already outstanding if the company has demonstrated that it
            uses this flexibility appropriately.

       o    Proposals to submit private placements to shareholder vote.

       o    Other financing plans.

     We will vote against preemptive rights that we believe limit a company's
financing flexibility.

                                      11

     Compensation
     Pioneer supports compensation plans that link pay to shareholder returns
     and believes that management has the best understanding of the level of
     compensation needed to attract and retain qualified people. At the same
     time, stock-related compensation plans have a significant economic impact
     and a direct effect on the balance sheet. Therefore, while we do not want
     to micromanage a company's compensation programs, we will place limits on
     the potential dilution these plans may impose.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    401(k) benefit plans.

       o    Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), as long as shares
            allocated to ESOPs are less than 5% of outstanding shares. Larger
            blocks of stock in ESOPs can serve as a takeover defense. We will
            support proposals to submit ESOPs to shareholder vote.

       o    Various issues related to the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act
            of 1993 (OBRA), including:

     o Amendments to performance plans to conform with OBRA;

     o Caps on annual grants or amendments of administrative features;

     o Adding performance goals; and

     o Cash or cash-and-stock bonus plans.

       o    Establish a process to link pay, including stock-option grants, to
            performance, leaving specifics of implementation to the company.

       o    Require that option repricings be submitted to shareholders.

       o    Require the expensing of stock-option awards.

       o    Require reporting of executive retirement benefits (deferred
            compensation, split-dollar life insurance, SERPs, and pension
            benefits).

       o    Employee stock purchase plans where the purchase price is equal to
            at least 85% of the market price, where the offering period is no
            greater than 27 months and where potential dilution (as defined
            below) is no greater than 10%.

                                       12
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Executive and director stock-related compensation plans. We will
            consider the following factors when reviewing these plans:

       o    The program must be of a reasonable size. We will approve plans
            where the combined employee and director plans together would
            generate less than 15% dilution. We will reject plans with 15% or
            more potential dilution.

            Dilution = (A + B + C) / (A + B + C + D), where

            A = Shares reserved for plan/amendment,

            B = Shares available under continuing plans,

            C = Shares granted but unexercised and

            D = Shares outstanding.

       o    The plan must not:

            o   Explicitly permit unlimited option repricing authority or that
                have repriced in the past without shareholder approval.

            o   Be a self-replenishing "evergreen" plan, plans that grant
                discount options and tax offset payments.

     o We are generally in favor of proposals that increase participation beyond
       executives.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt rigorous
       vesting provisions for stock option plans such as those that vest
       incrementally over, at least, a three- or four-year period with a pro
       rata portion of the shares becoming exercisable on an annual basis
       following grant date.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to disclose their
       window period policies for stock transactions. Window period policies
       ensure that employees do not exercise options based on insider
       information contemporaneous with quarterly earnings releases and other
       material corporate announcements.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt stock holding
       periods for their executives.

       o    All other employee stock purchase plans.

       o    All other compensation-related proposals, including deferred
            compensation plans, employment agreements, loan guarantee programs
            and retirement plans.

       o    All other proposals regarding stock compensation plans, including
            extending the life of a plan, changing vesting restrictions,
            repricing options, lengthening exercise periods or accelerating
            distribution of awards and pyramiding and cashless exercise
            programs.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     We will vote against:

       o    Pensions for non-employee directors. We believe these retirement
            plans reduce director objectivity.

       o    Elimination of stock option plans.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Limits on executive and director pay.

       o    Stock in lieu of cash compensation for directors.

     Corporate Governance
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Confidential Voting.

       o    Equal access provisions, which allow shareholders to contribute
            their opinion to proxy materials.

       o    Proposals requiring directors to disclose their ownership of shares
            in the company.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Change in the state of incorporation. We will support
            reincorporations supported by valid business reasons. We will
            oppose those that appear to be solely for the purpose of
            strengthening takeover defenses.

       o    Bundled proposals. We will evaluate the overall impact of the
            proposal.

       o    Adopting or amending the charter, bylaws or articles of association.

       o    Shareholder appraisal rights, which allow shareholders to demand
            judicial review of an acquisition price.

     We will vote against:

       o    Shareholder advisory committees. While management should solicit
            shareholder input, we prefer to leave the method of doing so to
            management's discretion.

       o    Limitations on stock ownership or voting rights.

       o    Reduction in share ownership disclosure guidelines.

                                       14
<PAGE>

     Mergers and Restructurings
     Pioneer will vote on the following and similar issues on a case-by-case
     basis:

       o    Mergers and acquisitions.

       o    Corporate restructurings, including spin-offs, liquidations, asset
            sales, joint ventures, conversions to holding company and
            conversions to self-managed REIT structure.

       o    Debt restructurings.

       o    Conversion of securities.

       o    Issuance of shares to facilitate a merger.

       o    Private placements, warrants, convertible debentures.

       o    Proposals requiring management to inform shareholders of merger
            opportunities.

     We will normally vote against shareholder proposals requiring that the
     company be put up for sale.

     Mutual Funds
     Many of our portfolios may invest in shares of closed-end mutual funds or
     exchange-traded funds. The non-corporate structure of these investments
     raises several unique proxy voting issues.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Establishment of new classes or series of shares.

       o    Establishment of a master-feeder structure.

     Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case on:

       o    Changes in investment policy. We will normally support changes
            that do not affect the investment objective or overall risk level
            of the fund. We will examine more fundamental changes on a
            case-by-case basis.

       o    Approval of new or amended advisory contracts.

       o    Changes from closed-end to open-end format.

       o    Authorization for, or increase in, preferred shares.

       o    Disposition of assets, termination, liquidation, or mergers.

       o    Classified boards of closed-end mutual funds, but will typically
            support such proposals.

                                       15
<PAGE>

     Social Issues
     Pioneer will abstain on stockholder proposals calling for greater
     disclosure of corporate activities with regard to social issues. "Social
     Issues" may generally be described as shareholder proposals for a company
     to:

       o    Conduct studies regarding certain issues of public concern and
            interest;

       o    Study the feasibility of the company taking certain actions with
            regard to such issues; or

       o    Take specific action, including ceasing certain behavior and
            adopting company standards and principles, in relation to issues
            of public concern and interest.

     We believe these issues are important and should receive management
     attention.

     Pioneer will vote against proposals calling for substantial changes in the
     company's business or activities. We will also normally vote against
     proposals with regard to contributions, believing that management should
     control the routine disbursement of funds.

                                       16

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
When a portfolio manager is responsible for the management of more than one
account, the potential arises for the portfolio manager to favor one account
over another. The principal types of potential conflicts of interest that may
arise are discussed below. For the reasons outlined below, Pioneer does not
believe that any material conflicts are likely to arise out of a portfolio
manager's responsibility for the management of the fund as well as one or more
other accounts. Although Pioneer has adopted procedures that it believes are
reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the federal securities
laws and to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest to affect its
portfolio management decisions, there can be no assurance that all conflicts
will be identified or that all procedures will be effective in mitigating the
potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of such conflicts of interest
are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager has a financial incentive
to favor one account over another. Pioneer has structured its compensation
arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit such potential for conflicts
of interest. See "Compensation of Portfolio Managers" below.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in allocating new
  investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial public
  offerings and private placements. If, for example, an initial public
  offering that was expected to appreciate in value significantly shortly
  after the offering was allocated to a single account, that account may be
  expected to have better investment performance than other accounts that did
  not receive an allocation of the initial public offering. Generally,
  investments for which there is limited availability are allocated based upon
  a range of factors including available cash and consistency with the
  accounts' investment objectives and policies. This allocation methodology
  necessarily involves some subjective elements but is intended over time to
  treat each client in an equitable and fair manner. Generally, the investment
  opportunity is allocated among participating accounts on a pro rata


                                       0
<PAGE>

 basis. Although Pioneer believes that its practices are reasonably designed to
 treat each client in an equitable and fair manner, there may be instances
 where a fund may not participate, or may participate to a lesser degree than
 other clients, in the allocation of an investment opportunity.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in the order in
  which trades for the accounts are placed. If a portfolio manager determines
  to purchase a security for more than one account in an aggregate amount that
  may influence the market price of the security, accounts that purchased or
  sold the security first may receive a more favorable price than accounts
  that made subsequent transactions. The less liquid the market for the
  security or the greater the percentage that the proposed aggregate purchases
  or sales represent of average daily trading volume, the greater the
  potential for accounts that make subsequent purchases or sales to receive a
  less favorable price. When a portfolio manager intends to trade the same
  security on the same day for more than one account, the trades typically are
  "bunched," which means that the trades for the individual accounts are
  aggregated and each account receives the same price. There are some types of
  accounts as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons
  (such as directed brokerage arrangements). Circumstances may also arise
  where the trader believes that bunching the orders may not result in the
  best possible price. Where those accounts or circumstances are involved,
  Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result in as favorable
  a price as possible for such client.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager's
  compensation is tied to the performance of that account to a greater degree
  than other accounts managed by the portfolio manager. If, for example, the
  portfolio manager receives a bonus based upon the performance of certain
  accounts relative to a benchmark while other accounts are disregarded for
  this purpose, the portfolio manager will have a financial incentive to seek
  to have the accounts that determine the portfolio manager's bonus achieve
  the best possible performance to the possible detriment of other accounts.
  Similarly, if Pioneer receives a performance-based advisory fee, the
  portfolio manager may favor that account, whether or not the performance of
  that account directly determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager has a
  beneficial interest in the account, in order to benefit a large client or to
  compensate a client that had poor returns. For example, if the portfolio
  manager held an interest in an investment partnership that was one of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager, the portfolio manager would have
  an economic incentive to favor the account in which the portfolio manager
  held an interest.

o If the different accounts have materially and potentially conflicting
  investment objectives or strategies, a conflict of interest could arise. For
  example, if a portfolio manager purchases a security for one account and
  sells the same security for another account, such trading pattern may
  disadvantage either the account that is long or short. In making portfolio
  manager assignments, Pioneer seeks to avoid such potentially conflicting
  situations. However, where a portfolio manager is responsible for accounts
  with differing investment objectives and policies, it is possible that the
  portfolio manager will conclude that it is in the best interest of one
  account to sell a portfolio security while another account continues to hold
  or increase the holding in such security.


COMPENSATION OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER
Pioneer has adopted a system of compensation for portfolio managers that seeks
to align the financial interests of the portfolio managers with those of
shareholders of the accounts (including Pioneer funds) the portfolio managers
manage, as well as with the financial performance of Pioneer. The compensation
program for all Pioneer portfolio managers includes a base salary (determined
by the rank and tenure of the employee) and an annual bonus program, as well as
customary benefits that are offered generally to all full-time employees. Base
compensation is fixed and normally reevaluated on an annual basis. Pioneer
seeks to set base compensation at market rates, taking into account the
experience and responsibilities of the portfolio manager. The bonus plan is
intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation that is
tied to the portfolio manager achieving superior investment performance and
align the interests of


                                       1
<PAGE>

the investment professional with those of shareholders, as well as with the
financial performance of Pioneer. Any bonus under the plan is completely
discretionary, with a maximum annual bonus that may be in excess of base
salary. The annual bonus is based upon a combination of the following factors:

o QUANTITATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The quantitative investment performance
  calculation is based on pre-tax investment performance of all of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the fund and any
  other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a one-year period (20%
  weighting) and four-year period (80% weighting), measured for periods ending
  on December 31. The accounts, which include the fund, are ranked against a
  group of mutual funds with similar investment objectives and investment
  focus (60%) and a broad-based securities market index measuring the
  performance of the same type of securities in which the accounts invest
  (40%), which, in the case of the fund, is the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
  High Yield Master II Index. As a result of these two benchmarks, the
  performance of the portfolio manager for compensation purposes is measured
  against the criteria that are relevant to the portfolio manager's
  competitive universe.

o QUALITATIVE PERFORMANCE. The qualitative performance component with respect
  to all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager includes objectives,
  such as effectiveness in the areas of teamwork, leadership, communications
  and marketing, that are mutually established and evaluated by each portfolio
  manager and management.

o PIONEER RESULTS AND BUSINESS LINE RESULTS. Pioneer's financial performance,
  as well as the investment performance of its investment management group,
  affect a portfolio manager's actual bonus by a leverage factor of plus or
  minus (+/-) a predetermined percentage.

The quantitative and qualitative performance components comprise 80% and 20%,
respectively, of the overall bonus calculation (on a pre-adjustment basis). A
portion of the annual bonus is deferred for a specified period and may be
invested in one or more Pioneer funds.

Certain portfolio managers participate in other programs designed to reward and
retain key contributors. Senior executives or other key employees are granted
performance units based on the stock price performance of UniCredit and the
financial performance of Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., which are
affiliates of Pioneer. Portfolio managers also may participate in a deferred
compensation program, whereby deferred amounts are invested in one or more
Pioneer funds.

ITEM 9. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT
INVESTMENT COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company,
in the following tabular format, provide the information specified in
paragraph (b) of this Item with respect to any purchase made by or on
behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser, as defined in
Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of
shares or other units of any class of the registrant's equity securities
that is registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781).

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases
made by or on behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser
as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the Exchange Act), of shares of the registrants equity
securities that are registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.



ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Describe any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors, where
those changes were implemented after the registrant last provided
disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of
Regulation S-R(17 CFR 229.407)(as required by Item 22(b)(15))
of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item.


There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the
shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of
directors since the registrant last provided disclosure in response
to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-R of Schedule 14(A)
in its definitive proxy statement, or this item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive and
principal financials officers, or persons performing similar functions,
regarding the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-3(c))) as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report
that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph,
based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule
30a-3(b) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30(a)-3(b) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).

The registrant's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have
concluded that the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective based
on the evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days of the
filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose any change in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act (17CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that
occured during the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

There were no significant changes in the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the second
fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant intends to
satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an exhibit.



(2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2(a) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-2(a)) , exactly as set forth below:

Filed herewith.

                                CODE OF ETHICS

                                      FOR

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

   Fund Distributor, Inc. overlap or conflict with the provisions of the this
   Code, they are superseded by this Code.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

   A Senior Officer's responsibilities under this Code are limited to Fund
   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,
   matters in which the Senior Officer routinely participates, and matters with
   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.

   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
