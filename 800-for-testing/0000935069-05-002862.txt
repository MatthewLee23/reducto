1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC and the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC
(collectively the "Funds" and individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of
Delaware as limited liability companies. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment companies. Each of the Funds is a
fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital appreciation by allocating their assets
among a select group of private investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds)
("Portfolio Funds") that utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies
specific for each Fund to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the
Investment Manager to the Funds.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market neutral
strategies.

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by Members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.


                                                                              14

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current market exchange and the differences
could be material to the financial statements. The use of different factors or
estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair
value.

C. Fund Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

                                                                              15

<PAGE>

              Notes to Financial Statements (continued) (unaudited)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to be treated as a partnership for Federal income tax
purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit relating
to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss. Accordingly, no
provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the accompanying financial
statements.

E.  Distribution Policy

Each Fund has no present intention of making periodic distributions of its net
investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and frequency
of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of the
Board.

F.  Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G.  Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Funds treat all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three
months as cash equivalents.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.
The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.50% of each Fund's average monthly net assets, through
December 31, 2003. Effective January 1, 2004, the Investment Manager has
contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to limit the Funds' other
expenses at 0.25% of each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May
31, 2006.

                                                                              16

<PAGE>

              Notes to Financial Statements (continued) (unaudited)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Investment Manager may also be paid an annual performance-based incentive
fee outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of up to 0.12%, subject to certain fee
minimums, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain out-of-pocket
expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian, a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act receives an annual retainer of $25,000 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $2,500 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee receives an additional annual
retainer of $1,500. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interest in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

                                                                              17

<PAGE>

              Notes to Financial Statements (continued) (unaudited)

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Funds invest primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques, including
leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a
high percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to
achieve a potentially greater investment return. As a result, the Portfolio
Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political, and regulatory
developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may
experience increased volatility of the Portfolio Funds' net asset value. The
Funds invest in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk.

Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Funds, including
risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Funds, risks relating to
compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of
Interests.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

             Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements (unaudited)

The Board of each Fund unanimously approved the continuance of each Fund's
Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Investment Manager at a meeting held
in person on July 13, 2005.

In approving each Advisory Agreement each Fund's Board of Managers, including
the Independent Board Members, considered the nature, quality and scope of the
services provided by the Investment Manager, the performance, fees and expenses
of each Fund compared to other similar investment companies, the Investment
Manager's expenses in providing the services, the profitability of the
Investment Manager and its affiliated companies and other benefits they derive
from their relationship with each Fund and the extent to which economies of
scale are shared with each Fund. The Independent Board Members reviewed reports
from third parties and management about the foregoing factors and changes, if
any, in such items since the Board Members' deliberations in connection with the
initial approval of each Advisory Agreement. In particular, the Independent
Board Members noted that the proposed Management Fee was lower than the
management fee for most investment companies similar to the Funds.

The Independent Board Members noted their confidence in the capability and
integrity of the senior management and staff of the Investment Manager and the
financial strength of the Investment Manager. The Independent Board Members
weighed the foregoing factors in light of the advice given to them by legal
counsel to the Fund as to the law applicable to the review of investment
advisory contracts. Based upon its review, each Fund's Board of Managers,
including all of the Independent Board Members, determined, in the exercise of
its business judgment, that approval of the Advisory Agreement with respect to
each Fund was in the best interests of each Fund and its Members.

during the period in which this report is being prepared;

operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial information; and
