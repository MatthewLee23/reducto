(a) The aggregate cost of investments in Portfolio Funds for tax purposes was
approximately $481,710,687. Net unrealized depreciation on investments for tax
purposes was $23,424,960 consisting of $25,141,589 of gross unrealized
appreciation, and $48,566,549 of gross unrealized depreciation.

(b) The Portfolio Fund instituted a liquidity restructuring plan effective July
1, 2009 by offering a new share class (the "Q2 Shares") that is subject to more
restrictive liquidity. The Q2 Shares are redeemable on a non-calendar quarter
basis subject to a 2.5% fund-level gate (restriction on redemptions), with
additional liquidity available at a discount to NAV. The Fund submitted a full
redemption request to this Portfolio Fund for the November 30, 2009 redemption
date and is expected to receive approximately 4% of the requested redemption
amount for the above referenced redemption date.

(c) The Portfolio Fund is liquidating its assets and is in the process of
returning capital to its partners. Due to the liquidation, the Portfolio Fund
has suspended redemptions. As of the date of this report, the Portfolio Fund has
not distributed any proceeds to its limited partners since the liquidation date,
and does not anticipate distributing any proceeds in 2009. The full liquidation
is expected to take from two to four years following the date of this report.

(d) As of September 30, 2009, approximately 11% of the Fund's non-side-pocketed
investment with the Portfolio Fund remained in a special purpose vehicle ("SPV")
which was created for the March 31, 2009 redemptions. $206,123 reflected as a
fair value for GCP II SPV II on the Schedule of Investments represents the
Fund's investment in SPV. SPV is expected to be fully liquidated within the next
two years.

(e) The Portfolio Fund transferred all of its assets held in a non-segregated
form (securities held in a non-cash account) at Lehman Brothers International
(53% of the Portfolio Fund's 9/30/08 NAV) into a segregated account held by the
Portfolio Fund. The funds held in the segregated account were not available for
redemption as of the date of this report.

(f) The Portfolio Fund is liquidating its assets and is in the process of
returning capital to its partners. Due to the liquidation, the Portfolio Fund
has suspended redemptions. Cash distributions will be made to the partners on a
pro-rata basis as the Portfolio Fund's assets are liquidated.

(g) The Portfolio Fund applied a 6% reserve holdback to the December 31, 2008
and future redemptions to provide for possible contingent liabilities related to
insolvency of Lehman Brothers Holdings and its affiliates. The reserve holdback
has not been released as of the date of this report and is only applicable to
the partners who were in the Portfolio Fund as of September 30, 2008. The Fund
has not submitted any redemption requests to the Portfolio Fund as of the date
of this report.

                               September 30, 2009

(h) The Portfolio Fund imposed a gate (restriction) on the June 30, 2009
redemptions and provided for redemptions up to 15% of the Portfolio Fund's net
assets through cash distributions. Based on the gate, the partners received
approximately 20% of the requested redemption amount through cash distributions.
The next eligible liquidity date for this Portfolio Fund is December 31, 2009.
It is unknown, as of the date of this report, whether the Portfolio Fund intends
to impose a restriction on its December 31, 2009 redemptions. The Fund did not
submit a redemption request to the Portfolio Fund for the June 30, 2009 and
December 31, 2009 redemption dates.

(i) As of September 30, 2009, approximately 34% of the Fund's non-side-pocketed
capital ("main portfolio") remained in a special liquidating vehicle ("SLV")
created on December 31, 2008 in response to significant redemption requests. As
the assets held in SLV are monetized, the proceeds will be distributed in cash
to the redeeming partners, and re-allocated to the main portfolio for the
non-redeeming partners.

(j) The Portfolio Fund transferred approximately 3% of the requested redemption
amounts for the September 30, 2009 redemption date to a liquidating vehicle. The
Fund submitted a full redemption request to the Portfolio Fund for the September
30, 2009 redemption date. $56,696 reflected as a fair value on the Schedule of
Investments represents the Fund's investment in the liquidating vehicle.

(k) The Portfolio Fund suspended withdrawals in the fourth quarter of 2008.
Subsequent to the date of this report, the Portfolio Fund announced it will lift
the suspension of redemptions effective November 30, 2009. The Fund submitted a
full redemption request to the Portfolio Fund for the March 31, 2009 redemption
date and is expected to be paid in accordance with the Portfolio Fund's offering
documents, which include a 1/16th investor level gate, once the redemption
suspension is lifted.

(l) Approximately 13% of the limited partners' capital requested for redemption
effective December 31, 2008 remains in a special purpose vehicle ("SPV") created
to provide for an orderly liquidation of those assets. The Fund did not submit a
redemption request to the Portfolio Fund and, therefore, was not subject to the
aforementioned SPV.

(m) As a result of significant redemption requests, the Portfolio Fund
implemented a reorganization plan in 2008 which included an option to continue
participation in the Portfolio Fund and a liquidation option. The Fund selected
the liquidation option. Under the terms of the liquidation option, the Fund
receives cash distributions as the Portfolio Fund's assets are liquidated. The
Fund is expected to receive the majority of its remaining capital by December
31, 2009.

(n) The Portfolio Fund has restricted redemption rights by transferring the
instruments with an illiquid profile into a side pocket investment as of
December 31, 2008. As of the date of this report, approximately 14% of the
Fund's investment in the Portfolio Fund remains in the side pocket.

(o) The Portfolio Fund imposed a restriction (gate) on the June 30, 2009 and
September 30, 2009 redemption dates and provided for redemptions up to 10% of
the Portfolio Fund's net assets through cash distributions. The Fund submitted a
full redemption request to the Portfolio Fund for the June 30, 2009 redemption
date and received approximately 15% of its capital in July 2009. The Fund did
not submit a redemption request to this Portfolio Fund for the September 30,
2009 redemption date. Subsequent to the date of this report, the Portfolio Fund
issued a restructuring plan which gave all limited partners the opportunity to
remain in the existing fund, move into a liquidating vehicle or move into a new
fund with an investor level gate and improved fees. The reorganization plan was
approved by limited partners and became effective on October 31, 2009. The Fund
selected to transfer its capital to the new fund.

(p) As a result of significant redemption requests, the Portfolio Fund created a
liquidating trust for the partners who requested March 31, 2009 redemption. The
liquidation trust was to provide for an orderly liquidation of its assets. As of
the date of this report, the liquidating trust represented approximately 40% of
the Portfolio Fund's net assets. The Fund has not submitted any redemption
requests to this Portfolio Fund as of the date of this report.

The below ratios are calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses
as applicable by the average of total monthly members' capital. Total return
amounts are calculated by geometrically linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.

1.  ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end  management  investment company and
is  operating  as a  diversified  investment  company.  The Fund has many of the
features of a private  investment fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests")  are
offered  only in  private  placements  to persons  (i) who are both  "accredited
investors" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and "qualified clients"
under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and
(ii) who meet other investor  eligibility  criteria established by the Fund. The
primary  investment  objectives  of the Fund  are to  provide  investors  (i) an
attractive,  long-term rate of return, on an absolute as well as a risk-adjusted
basis,  (ii) low performance  volatility and (iii) minimal  correlation with the
equity  and  fixed  income   markets.   The  Fund   employs  a   multi-strategy,
multi-manager  investment  strategy  premised  on the risk  control  benefits of
diversification  and the value of a hedged investment  approach.  The Fund seeks
diversification by investing in partnerships and other investment  vehicles (the
"Portfolio  Funds") that (i) pursue  non-traditional  investment  strategies and
(ii) are expected to exhibit a low degree of performance  correlation,  not only
with broad market indices but also with each other.  These  Portfolio  Funds are
managed by selected investment managers  ("Investment  Managers") who specialize
in the chosen  strategies.  As of September  30, 2009,  the Fund  invested in 51
Portfolio Funds. There can be no assurance that the investment  objective of the
Fund will be achieved.

Banc of America  Investment  Advisors,  Inc. (the  "Adviser") is the  investment
adviser to the Fund.  The Adviser is registered  as an investment  adviser under
the Advisers Act. The Adviser is an indirect wholly-owned  subsidiary of Bank of
America  Corporation   ("BAC").  The  Adviser  has  retained  Grosvenor  Capital
Management,  L.P.  ("Grosvenor" or the  "Subadviser") as subadviser to the Fund.
The Adviser and the  Subadviser  have been  designated  as special  members (the
"Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser  and the  Board of  Directors  (the  "Board")  of the  Fund.  The  Board
exercises the same powers,  authorities  and  responsibilities  on behalf of the
Fund as are customarily  exercised by directors of a typical  investment company
registered under the 1940 Act and organized as a corporation.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a.  USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires  management
to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

b.  CODIFICATION

In June 2009, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued FASB
Accounting  Standards   Codification  (the  "Codification")  as  the  source  of
authoritative  accounting  principles  recognized  by the FASB to be  applied by
nongovernmental   entities  in  the  preparation  of  financial   statements  in
conformity  with GAAP.  All guidance  contained in the  Codification  carries an
equal level of authority. On the effective date, the Codification superseded all
then-existing   non-SEC   accounting   and   reporting   standards.   All  other
nongrandfathered  non-SEC accounting literature not included in the Codification
will become  nonauthoritative.  The  Codification  is  effective  for  financial
statements  issued for interim and annual  periods  ending after  September  15,
2009.  The Fund has updated all of its  disclosures  to be  consistent  with the
Codification and has determined that the  implementation of the Codification did
not have a significant impact on its financial results.

c.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The Fund's  investments are valued by the Adviser as of the close of business on
the last business day of each month in accordance  with policies and  procedures
approved by the Board. The Fund's  investments in Portfolio Funds may be subject
to limitations  on  redemptions,  including the  assessment of early  redemption
fees. In addition,  market quotations for such interests are not available. As a
result,  the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds are valued at fair value,
which  normally  will be the  value  determined  by the  Portfolio  managers  or
administrators of the Portfolio Funds, subject to a determination by the Adviser
that such value  represents the fair value of the investment.  Such value of the
Fund's   interest  in  a  Portfolio   Fund   generally   represents  the  Fund's
proportionate  share of the net assets of the Portfolio  Fund.  The value of the
Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds is generally  increased by  additional
contributions  to the Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from
the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by  withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net
losses from the Portfolio Funds.

The Fund, the Adviser and the Subadviser rely upon audited and unaudited reports
and estimates  prepared by or for the Portfolio  Fund and any other  information
that  they  may  receive  from the  Portfolio  Fund,  which  may be  subject  to
adjustment by the  Portfolio  Fund or its manager or  administrator.  The values
assigned to the Fund's  investments in Portfolio Funds may not represent amounts
that  would   ultimately  be  realized,   as  such  amounts   depend  on  future
circumstances  and  cannot be  determined  until the  liquidation  of the Fund's
interest in a Portfolio  Fund.  The estimated  value of the Fund's  interests in
Portfolio  Funds  may  differ   significantly   from  the  value  received  upon
liquidation.  The  Fund,  the  Adviser  and the  Subadviser  will not be able to
confirm  independently the accuracy of the valuations  provided by the Portfolio
Funds or their managers or administrators.

c.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

Portfolio  Funds,  or  their  managers  or   administrator,   generally  use  an
independent  pricing source to value the funds'  securities.  Securities with no
readily  available  market value are initially  valued at cost,  with subsequent
adjustments to values, which reflect either meaningful third-party  transactions
in the private market, or fair value deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Fund or
its manager or administrator. In such instances,  consideration will be given to
the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, the amount that the
Portfolio  Funds  would  reasonably  expect  to  realize  upon  the  sale of the
securities  and other  factors  deemed  relevant by the  Portfolio  Funds or its
manager or administrator.

Some of the  Portfolio  Funds may  invest  all or a portion  of their  assets in
illiquid  securities  and  may  hold  all  or a  portion  of  these  investments
separately from the rest of their portfolio.  These separate baskets of illiquid
securities  (the "side  pockets") may be subject to  restrictions on liquidation
that  are  stricter  than  the  liquidity  restrictions  applicable  to  general
interests in the Portfolio Fund. If the Fund liquidates its interest from such a
Portfolio  Fund, it may be required to maintain the side pocket  investments for
an extended  period of time and retain its interests in the  Portfolio  Fund. In
instances,  where such a  Portfolio  Fund  closes its  operations,  the Fund may
receive  an `in kind'  distribution  and fully  remove  its  interests  from the
Portfolio Fund. The value of the side pockets may fluctuate significantly. As of
September 30, 2009, the Fund's  investments in side pockets  represented 2.5% of
the Fund's net assets.

In general,  most of the Portfolio  Funds in which the Fund invests  provide for
periodic withdrawals of capital ranging from monthly to bi-annually and, in some
cases, have lock up provisions under which the Fund may not withdraw capital for
a specified period after the date of its contribution,  which may be up to three
years.  The governing  documents of Portfolio Funds  generally  provide that the
Portfolio Fund may suspend,  limit or delay the right of its investors,  such as
the  Fund,  to  withdraw  capital.  Refer to the  Schedule  of  Investments  for
disclosure of redemption restrictions imposed as of September 30, 2009.

d.  INVESTMENTS

The Fund's  investments  are reported at fair value which is defined below.  The
Board and the Valuation Committee have approved procedures pursuant to which the
Fund  values  its  investment  in  Portfolio  Funds  subject  to the  review and
supervision  of the Board and  Valuation  Committee.  In  accordance  with these
procedures,  fair  value  of  investments  in the  Portfolio  Funds  takes  into
consideration  all  available  information  and other factors that the Board and
Valuation  Committee  deems  pertinent.   Generally,  the  Board  and  Valuation
Committee  will use  valuations  reported  to the Fund by the  managers of these
Portfolio  Funds as an input,  and the Fund,  Board or Valuation  Committee  may
reasonably determine that additional factors should be considered and reflected.
The value of the Fund's  investments  determined using the Fund's procedures may
differ from the value  reported by the Portfolio  Fund.  Because of the inherent
uncertainty of valuations,  however,  estimated values may differ  significantly
from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments
existed, and the differences could be material.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

d.  INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

GAAP  provides  for a fair  value  hierarchy  that  prioritizes  the  inputs  to
valuation  techniques used to measure fair value.  The objective of a fair value
measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly   transaction  between  market
participants  at the  measurement  date (an exit price).  Accordingly,  the fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for  identical  assets or  liabilities  (level 1  measurements)  and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).  The three levels
of the fair value hierarchy under GAAP are as follows:

o        Level 1 -- Unadjusted  quoted prices in active  markets for  identical,
         unrestricted  assets or  liabilities  that the Fund has the  ability to
         access at the measurement date;
o        Level 2 -- Quoted  prices  which are not  considered  to be active,  or
         inputs  that  are  observable   (either  directly  or  indirectly)  for
         substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
o        Level 3 --  Prices,  inputs  or  modeling  techniques  which  are  both
         significant to the fair value  measurement and unobservable  (supported
         by little or no market activity).

Inputs broadly refer to the  assumptions  that market  participants  use to make
valuation  decisions,  including  assumptions  about risk. The Adviser generally
uses the  value  reported  by the  Portfolio  Fund as the  primary  input to its
valuation;  however  adjustments  to the  reported  value  may be made  based on
various factors,  including, but not limited to, whether such reported value was
determined  in  accordance  with the GAAP  provisions  applicable  to investment
companies,  the  attributes  of the  interest  held,  including  the  rights and
obligations, and any restrictions or illiquidity on such interests, and the fair
value of the fund's investment portfolio or other assets and liabilities.

An  individual  fund's  level  within the fair value  hierarchy  is based on the
lowest  level of any input that is  significant  to the fair value  measurement.
However, the determination of what constitutes "observable" requires significant
judgment by the Adviser. The Adviser considers observable data to be that market
data which is readily available,  regularly distributed or updated, reliable and
verifiable, not proprietary,  provided by multiple, independent sources that are
actively  involved in the relevant market.  The  categorization of a fund within
the hierarchy is based upon the pricing  transparency  of that fund and does not
necessarily correspond to the Adviser's perceived risk of that fund.

Substantially  all of the  Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds  have  been
classified  within level 3, and the Fund generally does not hold any investments
that could be classified  as level 1 or level 2, as  observable  prices for such
investments are typically not available.  Assumptions used by the Fund, Board or
Valuation  Committee  due to the lack of  observable  inputs  may  significantly
impact  the  resulting  fair  value  and,  therefore,   the  Fund's  results  of
operations.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

e.  SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Purchases of investments in Portfolio  Funds are recorded as of the first day of
legal ownership of a Portfolio Fund and sales of Portfolio Funds are recorded as
of the last day of legal  ownership  or  participation.  Purchases  and sales of
other securities are accounted for on the trade-date  basis.  Realized gains and
losses are recorded at the time of disposition  of the respective  investment on
an average cost basis.

f.  INCOME RECOGNITION

Investment income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the average cost basis.

g.  INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax return  their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

The  Fund  has  determined  that  there  is  no  tax  liability  resulting  from
unrecognized  tax benefits  relating to uncertain  income tax positions taken or
expected to be taken on the tax return for the year ended  December 31, 2008. No
income tax returns are currently under  examination.  The statute of limitations
on the Fund's U.S. Federal tax returns remains open for the years ended December
31, 2005 through  December 31, 2008.  The statute of  limitations  on the Fund's
state and local tax  returns may remain open for an  additional  year  depending
upon the jurisdiction.

h.  CASH

Cash represents cash and cash equivalents held at PFPC Trust Company, the Fund's
custodian,  and includes  overnight  deposits in money market mutual  funds.  At
September 30, 2009, a total of $22,127,241 in cash was held at the custodian. Of
that  amount,  $2,600,043  was  held  in a  segregated  account  related  to the
holdbacks on Members' withdrawals from the Fund.

i.  FUTURES

The Fund's use of futures is primarily for tactical  hedging  purposes.  Initial
margin  deposits of cash and  securities  are made upon  entering  into  futures
contracts.  The contracts are marked to market monthly and the resulting changes
in value are  accounted  for as unrealized  gains and losses.  Variation  margin
payments are paid or received, depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses
are incurred.  When the contract is closed,  the Fund records a realized gain or
loss equal to the difference  between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing
transaction and the amount invested in the contract.

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)


2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

i.  FUTURES (CONTINUED)

Risks of entering into futures contracts include the possibility that there will
be an  imperfect  price  correlation  between  the  futures  and the  underlying
securities.  Second,  it is  possible  that  a lack  of  liquidity  for  futures
contracts  could exist in the  secondary  market,  resulting  in an inability to
close a  position  prior to its  maturity  date.  Third,  the  futures  contract
involves  risk that the Fund could lose more than the  original  margin  deposit
required to initiate a futures transaction.

The risk exists that losses  could exceed  amounts  disclosed on the schedule of
investments  or  statement  of assets  and  liabilities.  For the  period  ended
September 30, 2009, the Fund did not enter into any futures contracts.

j.  OPTIONS CONTRACTS

An option gives the owner the right,  but not the  obligation,  to buy or sell a
specified  item at a fixed price during a specified  period for a  nonrefundable
fee (the  "premium").  The  maximum  loss to the buyer is limited to the premium
originally  paid.  The  premiums  paid for the  purchase  of these  options  are
included in the  statement of assets,  liabilities  and  members'  capital as an
investment  and  subsequently  marked-to-market  to  reflect  the  value  of the
options, with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included in the statement
of operations.

As a writer  of  options,  the Fund  receives  a  premium  and bears the risk of
unfavorable  changes  in the  prices  of the  securities  or  index  instruments
underlying  the  options.  Premiums  received  from writing put and call options
which have not expired are presented in the liabilities section of the statement
of assets,  liabilities and members'  capital and  subsequently  adjusted to the
current  market  value of the options  written,  but not less than zero.  If the
current  market value of an option exceeds the premium  received,  the excess is
recorded as an  unrealized  loss and,  conversely,  if the  premium  exceeds the
current market value, the excess, to the extent of premium received, is recorded
as an  unrealized  gain.  The risk  exists  that  losses  could  exceed  amounts
disclosed on the schedule of investments or statement of assets and liabilities.
For the period ended  September 30, 2009, the Fund did not purchase or write any
options contracts.

3.  MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)


3.  MEMBERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period,  before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions  thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital  contributions  made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

The Board, from time to time and in its complete and exclusive  discretion,  may
determine to repurchase Interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  Interests  from Members at June 30,
2009.  The  Interests  redeemed  pursuant  to  such  tenders  are  shown  in the
Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for Interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject  any  application  for  Interest  in the  Fund.  Monies  accepted  for
investment in the Fund are held in escrow,  by PNC Global  Investment  Servicing
(U.S.), Inc. ("PNC"),  formerly known as PFPC, Inc., and deposited in a separate
non-interest  bearing  account  pending the next closing date. The monies in the
escrow account are invested in the Fund on that closing date.

Effective  September  1, 2008,  Interests  of the Fund placed by Banc of America
Investment  Services,  Inc.  are subject to a sales load (the  "Sales  Load") of
1.25% of the investment  amount on investments of less than $500,000.  The Sales
Load is applicable only to investors who make their first investment in the Fund
on or after  October  1,  2008.  The  Sales  Load may be  waived by the Fund for
certain types of investors. There was no Sales Load charged for the period ended
September 30, 2009.

4.  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees up
to 3% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations of
up to 20% of net  profits  earned.  The Fund bears all the  expenses  of its own
operations,  including,  but not  limited  to  legal,  audit,  fund  accounting,
registration,  and blue sky filing fees. With respect to the Fund's  investments
in Portfolio  Funds,  the Fund bears its ratable share of each Portfolio  Fund's
expenses  and also is subject  to its share of the  management  and  performance
fees, if any, charged by each Portfolio Fund. The Fund's share of management and
performance  fees  charged by such  entities  is in addition to fees paid by the
Fund to the Advisor and is not reflected as Fund expenses.  The Portfolio  Funds
generally provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with
lock up  provisions  of up to two years  from  initial  investment.  Most of the
Portfolio  Funds have the  contractual  discretion  to restrict  or  temporarily
suspend  redemptions in certain  circumstances.  Some Portfolio Funds may charge
redemption fees. Such provisions may restrict

the  Fund's  ability  to  respond to  changing  market  conditions.  None of the
Portfolio Funds are expected to make distributions  (e.g.,  dividend payments to
investors).

For the period  ended  September  30,  2009,  aggregate  purchases  and sales of
Portfolio Funds amounted to $64,991,186 and $31,352,730, respectively.

5.  CAPITAL COMMITMENTS OF THE FUND TO PORTFOLIO FUNDS

As of September  30, 2009,  the Fund had an unfunded  investment  commitment  to
Blackstone Real Estate Special Situations Fund, LP in the amount of $508,631.

6.  MANAGEMENT FEE

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management  fee, paid monthly in arrears,  equal to an annual rate
of 1.0% of the Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund before taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and  Subadviser,  the Adviser pays 45% of the management fee
that it  receives  from  the  Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser  is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

7.  INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for
such  Incentive  Period  over (b) the  greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the  balance  in the  Member's  Loss
Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

A Member's "Loss  Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period is zero and for
each Incentive Period  thereafter is equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward as
of  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased  or
decreased,  but not below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between
the net  losses  over  net  profits  allocated  to the  Member  for the  current
Incentive Period.  The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive
if its Interest as of the beginning of that

7.  INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

Incentive  Period  (adjusted  appropriately  for any  additional  contributions)
earned a rate of return equal to the one-year U.S.  Treasury note, as determined
on the first  day of each  calendar  quarter  and reset on the first day of each
calendar quarter. The Hurdle Rate Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period
to Incentive Period. The one-year U.S. Treasury note rates for June 30, 2009 and
September 30, 2009 were .5394% and .5482% per annum,  respectively.  On June 30,
2009,  an  incentive  allocation  of $651 was  realized.  Additional  capital of
$239,446  would have been  reallocable  to the Special  Members had the Members'
measurement period for incentive allocation closed on September 30, 2009.

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Member during the Incentive  Period prior to such  repurchase,  and the Member's
opening  capital  account  balance and Loss  Carryforward as of the beginning of
such Incentive Period, will be allocated between the two Interests in proportion
to the portion of the Member's Interest that is repurchased.

8.  ADMINISTRATION, REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER EXPENSES

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the Fund. PNC
serves as  administrator  and accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity
provides certain  accounting,  record keeping,  investor related  services,  and
regulatory administrative services. The Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian
and the administrator  based primarily upon month-end Members' capital,  subject
to a monthly minimum fee.

9.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Each Board member who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by
the 1940 Act,  (the  "Independent  Directors"),  receives an annual  retainer of
$6,000 plus a fee of $1,000 for each meeting  attended.  Any Board member who is
an  "interested  person"  does not receive any annual fee or other fees from the
Fund.  Board  members are  reimbursed by the Fund for  reasonable  out-of-pocket
expenses.

The affiliates of the Adviser may have banking, underwriting, lending, brokerage
or other  business  relationships  with the  Portfolio  Funds in which  the Fund
invests and with the companies in which the Portfolio Funds invest.

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
    CREDIT RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
invested in such limited partnerships,  limited liability companies, options and
futures contracts.

Because the Fund is a  closed-end  investment  company,  its  Interests  are not
redeemable  at the option of Members and are not  exchangeable  for interests of
any other fund. Although the Board in its discretion may cause the Fund to offer
from time to time to repurchase Interests at the members' capital account value,
the Interests are considerably  less liquid than shares of funds that trade on a
stock exchange or shares of open-end investment  companies.  With respect to any
tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase amount will be
determined  by the  Board in its  discretion  and  such  repurchase  amount  may
represent only a small portion of the Fund's outstanding Interests.  Because the
Fund's  investments in Portfolio Funds  themselves have limited  liquidity,  the
Fund may not be able to fund significant repurchases.

Members whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase also bear the risk that the
Fund's members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they
submit their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

Some Portfolio Funds have suspended or restricted  redemptions,  which increases
the liquidity  risk for the Fund.  Liquidity risk is the risk that the Fund will
encounter   difficulty  in  meeting   obligations   associated   with  financial
liabilities.  Among other things  liquidity could be impaired by an inability to
access  secured  and/or  unsecured  sources of  financing,  an inability to sell
assets  or  unforeseen  outflows  of  cash.  This  situation  may  arise  due to
circumstances outside of the Fund's control, such as a general market disruption
or an operational problem affecting the Fund or third parties. Also, the ability
to sell assets may be impaired if other market  participants are seeking to sell
similar assets at the same time.

The Fund's investments in Portfolio Funds can be redeemed on a limited basis. As
a result,  the Fund may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments
in the Portfolio Funds in order to meet liquidity requirements, or to respond to
specific events such as deterioration in the  creditworthiness  of any Portfolio
Fund.

11.  CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be remote.

12.  LITIGATION EVENT

The events described below have not directly  impacted the Fund or had any known
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

On February 9, 2005,  certain  affiliates  of the Adviser,  including the former
investment adviser to the Fund,  entered into Assurances of Discontinuance  with
the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlements") and consented to
the entry of  cease-and-desist  orders by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") (the "SEC  Orders") in  connection  with matters  relating to mutual
fund  trading.  Copies of the SEC Orders  are  available  on the SEC  website at
http://www.sec.gov.  Copies of the NYAG Settlements are available as part of the
Bank of America Corporation Form 8-K filing of February 10, 2005.

In  connection  with the events that  resulted in the NYAG  Settlements  and SEC
Orders,  various  parties filed suit against certain  Columbia Funds  (including
former Nations Funds), the Trustees of the Columbia Funds (including Trustees of
the former Nations Funds),  FleetBoston Financial Corporation (the former parent
of the Adviser) and certain of its  affiliated  entities  and/or Bank of America
Corporation  and  certain  of its  affiliated  entities.  More  than 300  cases,
including  those filed against  entities  unaffiliated  with the Columbia Funds,
their Boards,  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  and its affiliated  entities
and/or Bank of America Corporation and its affiliated entities, were transferred
to a  multi-district  proceeding in the Federal  District  Court in Maryland for
consolidated  or  coordinated  pretrial  proceedings.  The parties  have reached
settlements  with respect to the claims in the actions  concerning  the Columbia
Funds. All such settlements are subject to court approval.

13.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On May 28, 2009, the FASB issued  amendments to general  standards on accounting
for and  disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before
financial  statements  are  issued  or  are  available  to be  issued.  Although
containing  new  terminology,  the standard is based on the same  principles  as
those that  currently  exist in the  auditing  standards.  The Fund  adopted the
standard as of September 30, 2009 and determined that it did not have a material
impact on its financial statements.  The standard, which includes a new required
disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated  subsequent events,
is addressed in Note 14 of these financial statements.

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)


13.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Effective September 30, 2009, the Fund adopted the authoritative  guidance under
GAAP on  determining  fair value when the volume and level of  activity  for the
asset or liability have  significantly  decreased and  identifying  transactions
that are not orderly. The guidance requires some new disclosures with respect to
a) inputs and valuation  techniques  and b)  definition of "major  category" for
securities. The Fund determined that the adaptation of the guidance did not have
a  material  impact  on its  financial  statements.  Refer  to Note 2d of  these
financial statements for any additional information on the Fund's investments in
Portfolio Funds.

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Fund has  evaluated  all  events  subsequent  to the  balance  sheet date of
September 30, 2009, through November 30, 2009, which is the date these financial
statements are issued, and have noted the following:

Subsequent to September 30, 2009 the Fund received  additional  contributions of
$1,880,000.

On  October  2,  2009,  the Fund  announced  a tender  offer to  purchase  up to
$50,000,000  of  outstanding  Interests  from  Members.  The net asset  value of
Interests  will be calculated  for this purpose on December 31, 2009. The tender
offer expired on October 30, 2009.

A special  meeting of Members of the Fund was held on  November  19, 2009 at the
offices of the Fund, One Bryant Park, New York, New York 10036.  The meeting was
held to (1) elect Alan Brott, John C. Hover II, Victor F. Imbimbo,  Jr., Stephen
V.  Murphy and Thomas G.  Yellin as members of the Board and (2)  approve a Plan
and  Agreement  of  Reorganization  and  Merger  to  implement  a  master/feeder
investment structure. Each proposal was approved by a requisite number of votes.
The reorganization of the Fund to implement a master/feeder investment structure
is expected to occur as soon as reasonably  practicable on or about December 31,
2009.




The Fund files its complete schedule of portfolio  holdings with the SEC for the
first and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q within sixty days after
the end of the period.  The Fund's Form N-Q is  available  on the SEC website at
HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV,  and may be reviewed and copied at the SEC Public  Reference
Room in Washington,  D.C.  Information on the operation of the Public  Reference
Room may be obtained by calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

Effective  September 28, 2009, Mr. David R. Bailin  resigned as the President of
the Fund.  On November  23,  2009,  Mr.  Steven L. Suss,  the current  Principle
Financial  Officer and Treasurer of the Fund,  was appointed as the President of
the Fund and will perform in all three functions.


BOARD ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ADVISORY AND SUBADVISORY AGREEMENTS

At a meeting  held on  September  25,  2009,  the Board of Directors of Columbia
Management  Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund"),  which consists only of
Directors  who are not  "interested  persons"  of the  Fund (as  defined  in the
Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended),  approved the  continuation of the
Fund's  management  agreement (the "Management  Agreement") with Banc of America
Investment   Advisors,   Inc.  ("BAIA")  and  the  subadvisory   agreement  (the
"Subadvisory  Agreement"  and,  together  with  the  Management  Agreement,  the
"Advisory  Agreements")  with  BAIA  and  Grosvenor  Capital  Management,   L.P.
("Grosvenor")  for an additional  one-year period ending on October 31, 2010. At
that meeting, the Board considered information and factors that it believed were
relevant to the interests of the Fund's investors,  and during its deliberations
consulted with its independent legal counsel and with Fund counsel. In addition,
at most of its other meetings  throughout the year, the Board considers  matters
bearing on the Advisory Agreements.

The Directors received and reviewed all materials that they or their independent
legal  counsel  believed to be  reasonably  necessary  to evaluate  the Advisory
Agreements and determine whether to approve their continuation.  Those materials
included,  among other items, (i) a report prepared by BAIA comparing the Fund's
investment  performance to the performance of a universe of registered  funds of
hedge funds compiled by an independent  third party,  including funds managed by
third  parties and another  registered  fund managed by an  investment  advisory
affiliate  of BAIA (the "Third  Party-Identified  Peer  Group"),  and the Fund's
performance  benchmark;  (ii) a report  prepared  by BAIA  comparing  the Fund's
advisory fees and other  expenses,  including  information  comparing the Fund's
expenses to those of the Third  Party-Identified  Peer Group;  (iii) information
about  the  profitability  of the  Management  Agreement  to BAIA and  potential
"fall-out" or ancillary  benefits that BAIA and its  affiliates may receive as a
result of their  relationships  with the  Fund;  and (iv)  information  obtained
through BAIA's and  Grosvenor's  response to a letter prepared at the request of
the Directors by their independent legal counsel requesting certain  information
in connection with the renewal of the Fund's Advisory Agreements. The Board also
considered other information such as (i) BAIA's financial results and BAIA's and
Grosvenor's  financial  condition;  and (ii)  BAIA's and  Grosvenor's  resources
devoted  to,  and their  respective  records  of  compliance  with,  the  Fund's
investment   policies  and   restrictions,   policies  on  personal   securities
transactions  and  other  compliance  policies.   Throughout  the  process,  the
Directors  had the  opportunity  to ask  questions  of, and  request  additional
materials from, BAIA and Grosvenor and to consult with their  independent  legal
counsel.  The Board also  referred to  information  about the Fund's  investment
process that it received from Grosvenor's  investment  professionals at previous
meetings throughout the year.

In considering  whether to approve the continuation of the Advisory  Agreements,
the  Directors  did not identify any single  factor as  determinative,  and each
weighed various factors as he deemed appropriate.

                Supplemental information (unaudited) (continued)


BOARD ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ADVISORY AND SUBADVISORY AGREEMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Directors considered the following matters in connection with their approval
of the continuation of the Advisory Agreements:

NATURE,  EXTENT AND QUALITY OF THE SERVICES  PROVIDED.  The Board considered the
nature,  quality  and  extent  of the  advisory  services  provided  by BAIA and
Grosvenor under the Advisory  Agreements.  It considered the investment approach
Grosvenor employs,  Grosvenor's research capabilities,  the nature of BAIA's and
Grosvenor's  experience  and  resources,  the  experience  of relevant  BAIA and
Grosvenor  personnel,  and  BAIA's  and  Grosvenor's  resources,  practices  and
procedures designed to address regulatory compliance matters.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board reviewed the Fund's investment performance and
the performance of the funds in the Third Party-Identified Peer Group. The Board
reviewed the factors that Grosvenor identified as contributing to performance.

EXPENSE INFORMATION,  PROFITABILITY AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board considered
the fees payable  under the Fund's  Advisory  Agreements  and the fact that BAIA
pays  Grosvenor's  subadvisory  fees out of the advisory fees that BAIA receives
from the Fund.  The Board also  considered the incentive  allocation  payable to
Grosvenor and BAIA. The Board reviewed the Fund's fees and expenses and the fees
and expenses of other comparable registered funds of hedge funds included in the
Third  Party-Identified  Peer  Group.  The  Board  also  considered  information
regarding  the advisory  fees paid by a similar  registered  fund of hedge funds
managed by BAIA that was included in the Third  Party-Identified Peer Group. The
Board noted BAIA's  stated  justification  for the advisory  fees charged to the
Fund, which included information about performance and services.

The Board  reviewed the actual  dollar amount of fees paid to BAIA and Grosvenor
under the Advisory Agreements and BAIA's expenses in providing its services and,
in this context,  considered the fact that BAIA or its affiliates  provide other
services to the Fund and its investors and receive  payment for these  services.
The Board also  considered  so-called  "fall-out"  benefits to BAIA, such as any
incremental  increase  to its  reputation  derived  from  serving as  investment
adviser to the Fund.

In addition,  the Board considered  possible  economies of scale with respect to
the  management  of the Fund that  might be  realized  at  different  Fund asset
levels. In this regard,  the Board considered the Fund's existing and reasonably
foreseeable asset levels and information relating to BAIA's costs.

OTHER  CONSIDERATIONS.  The Board  also  considered  the  terms of the  Advisory
Agreements, including the applicable standard of care, and the structure of, and
the  method  used to  determine,  the  compensation  of BAIA's  and  Grosvenor's
portfolio  managers.  In addition,  the Board considered the extent to which the
Fund operated in accordance  with its  investment  objectives  and its record of
compliance with its investment restrictions,  and the compliance programs of the
Fund, BAIA and Grosvenor.

BOARD ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ADVISORY AND SUBADVISORY AGREEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Based on these considerations and following deliberation and discussion, in open
session with representatives of BAIA and Grosvenor and in executive session with
independent legal counsel,  the Directors  concluded that (i) BAIA and Grosvenor
had the capabilities,  resources and personnel necessary to fulfill their duties
under the Advisory  Agreements;  (ii) the scope and quality of services provided
under  the  Advisory  Agreements  are  consistent  with the  Fund's  operational
requirements;  (iii)  the  advisory  fees  paid to  BAIA  under  the  Management
Agreement as well as the incentive allocation payable to BAIA were reasonable in
light of the services  that BAIA  provides and the costs that BAIA incurs;  (iv)
the subadvisory  fees paid to Grosvenor under the Subadvisory  Agreement as well
as the incentive allocation payable to Grosvenor were reasonable in light of the
services that Grosvenor provides; (v) BAIA's profitability in providing advisory
services  to the Fund  was  reasonable;  and (vi)  there  was no  potential  for
economies  of scale to be realized by BAIA and  Grosvenor  in managing  the Fund
given the  current  asset size of the Fund,  although  there was  potential  for
economies of scale to be realized by BAIA and Grosvenor in the future should the
Fund continue to experience  significant asset growth. Based on their evaluation
of all  factors  that  they  deemed  to be  material,  including  those  factors
described  above, and assisted by the advice of independent  legal counsel,  the
Directors approved the continuance of the Advisory Agreements.

     information  included  in  this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
     respects the financial  condition,  results of  operations,  changes in net

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined

     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     (a)  Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or caused such
          disclosure   controls  and   procedures  to  be  designed   under  our
          supervision,  to ensure  that  material  information  relating  to the

          us by others within those entities,  particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  Designed such internal  control over  financial  reporting,  or caused
          such internal  control over  financial  reporting to be designed under
          our  supervision,   to  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
          reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     (c)  Evaluated the  effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure  controls

          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this  report  based on such
          evaluation; and

          control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during the second
          fiscal  quarter  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant  deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are
          reasonably  likely to  adversely  affect the  registrant's  ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
          control over financial reporting.
