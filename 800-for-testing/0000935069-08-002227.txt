SHAREHOLDER MEETING - FINAL RESULTS

     The Annual Meeting of Shareholders was held on May 19, 2008 at the
Greenwich Library in Greenwich, Connecticut. At that meeting, common and
preferred shareholders, voting together as a single class, voted in favor of
Proposal 1 to elect Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr. and Salvatore J. Zizza as Directors
of the Fund. A total of 124,272,022 votes and 124,607,183 votes were cast in
favor of each Director and a total of 3,584,339 votes and 3,249,178 votes were
withheld for each Director, respectively. In addition, preferred shareholders,
voting as a separate class, elected Anthony J. Colavita as a Director of the
Fund. A total of 5,918,389 votes were cast in favor of this Director and a total
of 193,408 votes were withheld for this Director. Mario J. Gabelli, Thomas E.
Bratter, James P. Conn, Arthur V. Ferrara and Anthony R. Pustorino continue to
serve in their capacities as Directors of the Fund.

     The Annual Meeting was adjourned to June 9, 2008 solely in regards to
Proposal 2, which concerned an amendment to the fundamental investment
restriction regarding borrowing, due to insufficient shareholder votes. The
reconvened meeting held on June 9, 2008 was adjourned with respect to Proposal 2
to June 30, 2008 and subsequently to July 15, 2008. On that date, common and
preferred shareholders, voting together as a single class, and preferred
shareholders, voting as a separate class, voted on Proposal 2. A total of
93,305,721 votes and 3,875,264 votes were cast in favor of the proposal,
6,242,574 votes and 321,785 votes were cast against the proposal, and 4,093,988
votes and 318,971 votes abstained, respectively. The requisite shareholder vote
was not obtained with respect to Proposal 2. The meeting was concluded after the
tabulation of the shareholder votes.

                         THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION. The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. (the "Equity Trust") is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Maryland
corporation on May 20, 1986 and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), whose primary objective is long-term growth
of capital. Investment operations commenced on August 21, 1986.

     The Equity Trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in equity
securities under normal market conditions (the "80% Policy"). The 80% Policy may
be changed without shareholder approval. The Equity Trust will provide
shareholders with notice at least 60 days prior to the implementation of any
changes in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION. Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's official closing price as of the close of business on the
day the securities are being valued. If there were no sales that day, the
security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or, if
there were no asked prices quoted on that day, then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such
day, the security is valued at the most recently available price or, if the
Board of Directors (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the
Board shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio
securities traded on more than one national securities exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most representative market, as determined
by the Adviser.

     Portfolio securities primarily traded on a foreign market are generally
valued at the preceding closing values of such securities on the relevant
market, but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the Board
if market conditions change significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the securities are being valued.
Debt instruments with remaining maturities of 60 days or less that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost, unless the Board determines such
amount does not reflect the securities' fair value, in which case these
securities will be fair valued as determined by the Board. Debt instruments
having a maturity greater than 60 days for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked prices quoted on such day, the security is valued using the
closing bid price. Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Board. Fair valuation methodologies and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial information about the company; comparisons to the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign securities to the equivalent U.S. dollar value ADR securities at the
close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of any other information that could
be indicative of the value of the security.

     On January 1, 2008, the Fund adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157") that clarifies the
definition of fair value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value, and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair
value measurements. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS 157
are described below:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities;


                                       18

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
          risk, etc.); and

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's
          determinations as to the fair value of investments).

     The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. The
summary of inputs used to value the Fund's net assets as of June 30, 2008 is as
follows:

     In March 2008, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (The "FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 161, "Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 161") that is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 is intended to
improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by requiring enhanced
disclosure that enables investors to understand how and why an entity uses
derivatives, how derivatives are accounted for, and how derivative instruments
affect an entity's results of operations and financial position. Management is
currently evaluating the implications of SFAS 161 on the Fund's financial
statement disclosures.

     REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary government securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System, or with other brokers or
dealers that meet credit guidelines established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board. Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes
possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase, and the Fund to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
The Fund will always receive and maintain securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest, will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount invested by the Fund in each agreement.


                                       19

<PAGE>

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

The Fund will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
upon evidence of book entry transfer of the collateral to the account of the
custodian. To the extent that any repurchase transaction exceeds one business
day, the value of the collateral is marked-to-market on a daily basis to
maintain the adequacy of the collateral. If the seller defaults and the value of
the collateral declines or if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect
to the seller of the security, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be
delayed or limited. At June 30, 2008, there were no open repurchase agreements.

     INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES. The Fund may invest, from time
to time, in shares of other investment companies (or entities that would be
considered investment companies but are excluded from the definition pursuant to
certain exceptions under the 1940 Act) (the "Acquired Funds") in accordance with
the 1940 Act and related rules. As a shareholder in the Fund, you would bear the
pro rata portion of the periodic expenses of the Acquired Funds in addition to
the Fund's expenses. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund's pro rata
portion of the periodic expenses charged by the Acquired Funds was less than one
basis point.

     OPTIONS. The Fund may purchase or write call or put options on securities
or indices. As a writer of put options, the Fund receives a premium at the
outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the
financial instrument underlying the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the
price of the underlying financial instrument decreases between the date the
option is written and the date on which the option is terminated. The Fund would
realize a gain, to the extent of the premium, if the price of the financial
instrument increases between those dates. If a call option is exercised, the
premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of underlying security in
determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a put option is
exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security.

     As a purchaser of put options, the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put option the underlying security at a specified
price. The seller of the put has the obligation to purchase the underlying
security upon exercise at the exercise price. If the price of the underlying
security declines, the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or exercise. If the
price of the underlying security increases or stays the same, the Fund would
realize a loss upon sale or at the expiration date, but only to the extent of
the premium paid.

     In the case of call options, these exercise prices are referred to as
"in-the-money", "at-the-money", and "out-of-the-money", respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying security will remain stable or decline during the option
period, (b) at-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the price of
the underlying security will remain stable, decline or advance moderately during
the option period, and (c) out-of-the-money call options when the Adviser
expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will be greater
than the appreciation in the price of the underlying security above the exercise
price. By writing a call option, the Fund limits its opportunity to profit from
any increase in the market value of the underlying security above the exercise
price of the option. Out-of-the-money, at-the-money, and in-the-money put
options (the reverse of call options as to the relation of exercise price to
market price) may be utilized in the same market environments that such call
options are used in equivalent transactions.

     SWAP AGREEMENTS. The Fund may enter into equity, contract for difference,
and interest rate swap or cap transactions. The use of swaps and caps is a
highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks
different from those associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. A
swap agreement may involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and
counterparty risk and exposure to loss in excess of the related amounts
reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In an interest rate swap,
the Fund would agree to pay to the other party to the interest rate swap (which
is known as the "counterparty") periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange
for the counterparty agreeing to pay


                                       20

<PAGE>

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

to the Fund periodically a variable rate payment that is intended to approximate
the Fund's variable rate payment obligation on Series C Preferred Stock and
Series E Preferred Stock. In an interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium
to the counterparty and, to the extent that a specified variable rate index
exceeds a predetermined fixed rate, would receive from that counterparty
payments of the difference based on the notional amount of such cap. In a swap,
a set of future cash flows are exchanged between two counterparties. One of
these cash flow streams will typically be based on a reference interest rate
combined with the performance of a notional value of shares of a stock. The
other will be based on the performance of the shares of a stock. Swap and cap
transactions introduce additional risk because the Fund would remain obligated
to pay preferred stock dividends when due in accordance with the Articles
Supplementary even if the counterparty defaulted. If there is a default by the
counterparty to a swap contract, the Fund will be limited to contractual
remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. There is no
assurance that the swap contract counterparties will be able to meet their
obligations pursuant to a swap contract or that, in the event of default, the
Fund will succeed in pursuing contractual remedies. The Fund thus assumes the
risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from obtaining payments owed to it
pursuant to a swap contract. The creditworthiness of the swap contract
counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize this risk. Depending on
the general state of short-term interest rates and the returns on the Fund's
portfolio securities at that point in time, such a default could negatively
affect the Fund's ability to make dividend payments. In addition, at the time a
swap or cap transaction reaches its scheduled termination date, there is a risk
that the Fund will not be able to obtain a replacement transaction or that the
terms of the replacement will not be as favorable as on the expiring
transaction.

     The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market and counterparty risk in excess of the amount recognized below.

     Unrealized gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
The change in value of swaps, including the accrual of periodic amounts of
interest to be paid or received on swaps, is reported as unrealized gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations. A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

     At June 30, 2008, there were no open interest rate swap agreements.

     The Fund has entered into a contract for difference swap agreement with
Bear, Stearns International Limited. Details of the swap at June 30, 2008 are as
follows:

</TABLE>

     FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose
of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and in the
value of securities it intends to purchase. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Fund is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the
value of the contract, which are included in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on investments and futures contracts. The Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a hedging instrument. The change in value of futures contracts primarily
corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid secondary market. Open futures contracts at June 30, 2008
are reflected within the Schedule of Investments.

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the transaction is denominated or another currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward rate and are marked-to-market daily. The change in market value is
included in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign
currency translations. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

     The use of forward foreign exchange contracts does not eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future. Although
forward foreign exchange contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency, they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the counterparties to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their contracts. At June 30, 2008, there were no open forward foreign
exchange contracts.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS. The books and records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Foreign currencies, investments, and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, income, and expenses are
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective dates of such
transactions. Unrealized gains and losses that result from changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities have been included
in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency
translations. Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting from
changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between
trade date and settlement date on investment securities transactions, foreign
currency transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and
dividends recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually received.
The portion of foreign currency gains and losses related to fluctuation in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

     FOREIGN SECURITIES. The Fund may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers. Investing in securities of foreign issuers involves special risks not
typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. The risks
include possible revaluation of currencies, the ability to repatriate funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political and economic developments. Moreover, securities of many foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES. The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on
investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable, based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

     RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES. The Fund may invest up to 10% of its
net assets in securities for which the markets are illiquid. Illiquid securities
include securities the disposition of which is subject to substantial legal or
contractual restrictions. The sale of illiquid securities often requires more
time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other
selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading on
national securities exchanges or

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

in the over-the-counter markets. Restricted securities may sell at a price lower
than similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale.
Securities freely saleable among qualified institutional investors under special
rules adopted by the SEC may be treated as liquid if they satisfy liquidity
standards established by the Board. The continued liquidity of such securities
is not as well assured as that of publicly traded securities, and accordingly
the Board will monitor their liquidity.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted for on the trade date with realized gain or loss on investments
determined by using the identified cost method. Interest income (including
amortization of premium and accretion of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized using the
effective yield to maturity method. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date except for certain dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN FEE CREDITS AND INTEREST EXPENSE. When cash balances are
maintained in the custody account, the Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included in custodian fees in the Statement of Operations with the corresponding
expense offset, if any, shown as "custodian fee credits." When cash balances are
overdrawn, the Fund is charged an overdraft fee equal to 110% of the 90 day
Treasury Bill rate on outstanding balances. This amount, if any, would be shown
as "interest expense" in the Statement of Operations.

     DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions to common shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to shareholders are based on
income and capital gains as determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency transactions held by the Fund, timing differences, and
differing characterizations of distributions made by the Fund. Distributions
from net investment income include net realized gains on foreign currency
transactions. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, adjustments are made to
the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise.
Permanent differences were primarily due to reclassifications of distributions,
swap investments and non-deductible spin off expenses. These reclassifications
have no impact on the NAV of the Fund.

     On June 28, 2007, the Fund contributed $67,695,672 in cash in exchange for
shares of the Gabelli Healthcare & Wellness(Rx) Trust, and on the same date
distributed such shares to holders of the Fund on record as of June 21, 2007 at
the rate of one share of the Gabelli Healthcare & Wellness(Rx) Trust for every
twenty shares of the Fund's common stock.

     Distributions to shareholders of the Fund's 7.20% Series B Cumulative
Preferred Stock, Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, 5.875% Series
D Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock,
and 6.20% Series F Cumulative Preferred Stock ("Cumulative Preferred Stock") are
recorded on a daily basis and are determined as described in Note 5.

     The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2007 was as follows:

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"). It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its net investment company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

     As of December 31, 2007, the components of accumulated earnings/(losses) on
a tax basis were as follows:

     FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" (the "Interpretation") established a
minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of
positions taken in filing tax returns (including whether the Fund is taxable in
a particular jurisdiction) and required certain expanded tax disclosures.

     For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund did not have any liability
for any unrecognized tax benefits. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties,
if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expenses in the
Statement of Operations. The Fund is not subject to examination by U.S. federal
tax authorities for tax years before 2004 and by state tax authorities for tax
years before 2003.

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. The Fund has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides that the Fund will pay the Adviser a fee, computed weekly and paid
monthly, equal on an annual basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's average
weekly net assets including the liquidation value of preferred stock. In
accordance with the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides a continuous
investment program for the Fund's portfolio and oversees the administration of
all aspects of the Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce
the management fee on the incremental assets attributable to the Cumulative
Preferred Stock if the total return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund,
including distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction, does not exceed
the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of
the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the fiscal year.

                          THE GABELLI EQUITY TRUST INC.
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

     The Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or the corresponding swap rate of each
particular series of Cumulative Preferred Stock for the period. For the six
months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common
shares did not exceed the stated dividend rate or the corresponding swap rate on
any of the series of Preferred Stock. Thus, management fees with respect to the
liquidation value of the preferred stock assets were reduced by $2,007,681.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund paid brokerage
commissions on security trades of $100,760 to Gabelli & Company, Inc. ("Gabelli
& Company"), an affiliate of the Adviser.

     The cost of calculating the Fund's NAV per share is a Fund expense pursuant
to the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser. During the six
months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund paid or accrued $22,500 to the Adviser in
connection with the cost of computing the Fund's NAV.

     As per the approval of the Board, the Fund compensates officers who are
employed by the Fund, and are not employed by the Adviser (although the officers
may receive incentive based variable compensation from affiliates of the
Adviser) and pays its allocated portion of the cost of the Fund's Chief
Compliance Officer. For the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund paid
$100,083, which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement of Operations.

     The Fund pays each Director who is not considered to be an affiliated
person an annual retainer of $12,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting attended
in person and $500 per telephonic meeting, and they are reimbursed for any out
of pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings. All Board committee members
receive $1,000 per meeting attended. In addition, the Audit Committee Chairman
receives an annual fee of $3,000, the Proxy Voting Committee Chairman receives
an annual fee of $1,500, the Nominating Committee Chairman receives an annual
fee of $2,000, and the Lead Director receives an annual fee of $1,000. Directors
who are directors or employees of the Adviser or an affiliated company receive
no compensation or expense reimbursement from the Fund.

4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of securities for
the six months ended June 30, 2008, other than short-term securities and U.S.
Government obligations, aggregated $131,715,651 and $56,744,942, respectively.

     Written options activity for the Fund for the six months ended June 30,
2008 was as follows:

5. CAPITAL. The charter permits the Fund to issue 246,000,000 shares of common
stock (par value $0.001) and authorizes the Board to increase its authorized
shares from time to time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of its shares
on the open market when the shares are trading on the New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") at a discount of 10% or more (or such other percentage as the Board may
determine from time to time) from the NAV of the shares. During the six months
ended June 30, 2008, the Fund did not repurchase any shares of its common stock
in the open market.

     The Fund's Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorizes the issuance
of up to 18,000,000 shares of $0.001 par value Cumulative Preferred Stock. The
Cumulative Preferred Stock is senior to the common stock and results in the
financial leveraging of the common stock. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common shareholders. Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Stock are cumulative. The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the Articles Supplementary to meet certain asset coverage tests with
respect to the Cumulative Preferred Stock. If the Fund fails to meet these
requirements and does not correct such failure, the Fund may be required to
redeem, in part or in full, the Series C Auction Rate, 5.875% Series D, Series E
Auction Rate, and 6.20% Series F Cumulative Preferred Stock at redemption prices
of $25,000, $25, $25,000, and $25, respectively, per share plus an amount equal
to the accumulated and unpaid dividends whether or not declared on such shares
in order to meet these requirements. Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing
asset coverage requirements could restrict the Fund's ability to pay dividends
to common shareholders and could lead to sales of portfolio securities at
inopportune times. The income received on the Fund's assets may vary in a manner
unrelated to the fixed and variable rates, which could have either a beneficial
or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to common
shareholders.

     At the Fund's August 15, 2007 Board meeting, the Board approved the filing
of a shelf registration with the SEC, to give the Fund the ability to offer
additional preferred shares. The shelf registration was declared effective by
the SEC on March 20, 2008.

     On June 20, 2001, the Fund received net proceeds of $159,329,175 (after
underwriting discounts of $5,197,500 and offering expenses of $473,325) from the
public offering of 6,600,000 shares of 7.20% Series B Cumulative Preferred
Stock. The Series B Preferred Shares were callable at any time at the
liquidation value plus accrued dividends following the expiration of the five
year call protection on June 20, 2006. On June 26, 2006, the Fund, as authorized
by the Board, redeemed 25% (1,650,000 shares) of its outstanding 7.20% Stock B
Cumulative Preferred Stock at the redemption price of $25.00 per share (the
liquidation value). On January 8, 2007, the Fund, as authorized by the Board,
redeemed the balance (4,950,000 shares) of its outstanding 7.20% Series B
Cumulative Preferred Stock at the redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus
accumulated and unpaid dividends through the redemption date of $0.06 per share.

     On June 27, 2002, the Fund received net proceeds of $128,246,557 (after
underwriting discounts of $1,300,000 and offering expenses of $453,443) from the
public offering of 5,200 shares of Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally held
every seven days, is expected to vary with short-term interest rates. If the
number of Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock subject to bid orders
by potential holders is less than the number of Series C Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock subject to sell orders, then the auction is considered to be a
failed auction, and the dividend rate will be the maximum rate. In that event,
holders that have submitted sell orders may not be able to sell any or all of
the Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock for which they have
submitted sell orders. The current maximum rate is 150% of the "AA" Financial
Composite Commercial Paper Rate. The dividend rates of Series C Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock ranged from 2.926% to 5.350% for

the six months ended June 30, 2008. Existing shareholders may submit an order to
hold, bid, or sell such shares on each auction date. Series C Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock shareholders may also trade shares in the secondary
market. The Fund, at its option, may redeem the Series C Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the redemption price at any time. During
the six months ended June 30, 2008, the Fund did not redeem any shares of Series
C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock. At June 30, 2008, 5,200 shares of
Series C Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock were outstanding with an
annualized dividend rate of 3.211% and accrued dividends amounted to $69,572.

     On October 7, 2003, the Fund received net proceeds of $72,375,842 (after

public offering of 3,000,000 shares of 5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred
Stock. Commencing October 7, 2008 and thereafter, the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 5.875% Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption price at any time. At June 30, 2008, 2,949,700 shares of 5.875%
Series D Cumulative Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued dividends
amounted to $60,172.

     On October 7, 2003, the Fund received net proceeds of $49,350,009 (after
underwriting discounts of $500,000 and offering expenses of $149,991) from the
public offering of 2,000 shares of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally held
every seven days, is expected to vary with short-term interest rates. If the
number of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock subject to bid orders
by potential holders is less than the number of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock subject to sell orders, then the auction is considered to be a
failed auction, and the dividend rate will be the maximum rate. In that event,
holders that have submitted sell orders may not be able to sell any or all of
the Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock for which they have
submitted sell orders. The current maximum rate is 150% of the "AA" Financial
Composite Commercial Paper Rate. The dividend rates of Series E Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock ranged from 2.956% to 5.510% for the six months ended
June 30, 2008. Existing shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid, or sell
such shares on each auction date. Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock shareholders may also trade shares in the secondary market. The Fund, at
its option, may redeem the Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock in
whole or in part at the redemption price at any time. During the six months
ended June 30, 2008, the Fund did not redeem any shares of Series E Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock. At June 30, 2008, 2,000 shares of Series E Auction
Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock were outstanding with an annualized dividend
rate of 3.286% and accrued dividends amounted to $18,255.

     On November 10, 2006, the Fund received net proceeds of $144,765,000 (after
underwriting discounts of $4,725,000 and estimated offering expenses of
$510,000) from the public offering of 6,000,000 shares of 6.20% Series F
Cumulative Preferred Stock. Commencing November 10, 2011 and thereafter, the
Fund, at its option, may redeem the 6.20% Series F Cumulative Preferred Stock in
whole or in part at the redemption price at any time. At June 30, 2008,
6,000,000 shares of 6.20% Series F Cumulative Preferred Stock were outstanding
and accrued dividends amounted to $129,167.

     The holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common stock as a single class. The
holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock voting together as a single class also
have the right currently to elect two Directors and under certain circumstances
are entitled to elect a majority of the Board of Directors. In addition, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be
required to approve any plan of reorganization adversely affecting the preferred
stock, and the approval of two-thirds of each class, voting separately, of the
Fund's outstanding voting stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a
closed-end

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

to an open-end investment company. The approval of a majority (as defined in the
1940 Act) of the outstanding preferred stock and a majority (as defined in the
1940 Act) of the Fund's outstanding voting securities are required to approve
certain other actions, including changes in the Fund's investment objectives or
fundamental investment policies.

6. INDEMNIFICATIONS. The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

7. OTHER MATTERS. On April 24, 2008, the Adviser entered into an administrative
settlement with the SEC to resolve the SEC's inquiry regarding prior frequent
trading activity in shares of the GAMCO Global Growth Fund (the "Global Growth
Fund") by one investor who was banned from the Global Growth Fund in August
2002. In the settlement, the SEC found that the Adviser had violated Section
206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule
17d-1 thereunder, and had aided and abetted and caused violations of Section
12(d)(1)(B)(i) of the 1940 Act. Under the terms of the settlement, the Adviser,
while neither admitting nor denying the SEC's findings and allegations, agreed,
among other things, to pay the previously reserved total of $16 million
(including a $5 million penalty), of which at least $11 million will be
distributed to shareholders of the Global Growth Fund in accordance with a plan
to be developed by an independent distribution consultant and approved by the
independent directors of the Global Growth Fund and the staff of the SEC, and to
cease and desist from future violations of the above referenced federal
securities laws. The settlement will not have a material adverse impact on the
Adviser or its ability to fulfill its obligations under the Advisory Agreement.
On the same day, the SEC filed a civil action against the Executive Vice
President and Chief Operating Officer of the Adviser, alleging violations of
certain federal securities laws arising from the same matter. The officer is
also an officer of the Global Growth Fund and other funds in the Gabelli/GAMCO
fund complex. The officer denies the allegations and is continuing in his
positions with the Adviser and the funds. The Adviser currently expects that any
resolution of the action against the officer will not have a material adverse
impact on the Adviser or its ability to fulfill its obligations under the
Advisory Agreement.

     On a separate matter, in August 2008, the Adviser made an offer to the
staff of the SEC to settle a previously disclosed matter concerning compliance
with Section 19(a) and Rule 19a-1 of the 1940 Act by two closed-end funds
managed by the Adviser. These provisions require registered investment companies
to provide written statements to shareholders when a distribution is made in the
nature of a dividend from a source other than net investment income. While the
two funds sent annual statements and provided other materials containing this
information, the funds did not send the notices required by Rule 19a-1 to
shareholders with each distribution in 2002 and 2003. The Adviser believes that
the funds have been in compliance with Rule 19a-1 since that time. The Adviser
believes that the settlement would have no effect on the funds or any material
adverse effect on the Adviser or its ability to manage the funds. This offer of
settlement is subject to final agreement regarding the specific language of the
SEC's administrative order and other settlement documents and approval by the
SEC.

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"), contemplates that the Board of Directors (the "Board") of The Gabelli
Equity Trust Inc. (the "Fund"), including a majority of the Directors who have
no direct or indirect interest in the investment advisory agreement and are not
"interested persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (the "Independent
Board Members"), are required to annually review and re-approve the terms of the
Fund's existing investment advisory agreement and approve any newly proposed
terms therein. In this regard, the Board reviewed and re-approved, during the
most recent six month period covered by this report, the Investment Advisory
Agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser") for
the Fund.

More specifically, at a meeting held on May 22, 2008, the Board, including the
Independent Board Members, considered the factors and reached the conclusions
described below relating to the selection of the Adviser and the re-approval of
the Advisory Agreement.

NATURE, EXTENT, AND QUALITY OF SERVICES. The Independent Board Members
considered the nature, quality, and extent of administrative and shareholder
services performed by the Adviser, including portfolio management, supervision
of Fund operations and compliance and regulatory filings and disclosures to
shareholders, general oversight of other service providers, review of Fund legal
issues, assisting the Independent Board Members in their capacity as directors,
and other services. The Independent Board Members concluded that the services
are extensive in nature and that the Adviser consistently delivered a high level
of service.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND AND ADVISER. The Independent Board Members
considered short-term and long-term investment performance for the Fund over
various periods of time as compared to relevant equity indices and the
performance, and concluded that the Adviser was delivering good performance
results consistent with the investment strategies being pursued by the Fund.

COSTS OF SERVICES AND PROFITS REALIZED BY THE ADVISER.

(A) COSTS OF SERVICES TO FUND: FEES AND EXPENSES. The Independent Board Members
considered the Fund's management fee rate and expense ratio relative to industry
averages for the Fund's peer group category and the advisory fees charged by the
Adviser and its affiliates to other fund and non-fund clients. The Independent
Board Members noted that the mix of services under the Advisory Agreement are
much more extensive than those under the advisory agreements for non-fund
clients. The Independent Board Members recognized that the investment advisory
fee paid by the Fund and the Fund's overall expense ratio is higher than average
for its peer group, but concluded that the fee is acceptable based upon the
qualifications, experience, reputation, and performance of the Adviser.

(B) PROFITABILITY AND COSTS OF SERVICES TO ADVISER. The Independent Board
Members considered the Adviser's overall profitability and costs, and proforma
estimates of the Adviser's profitability and costs attributable to the Fund: (i)
as part of the Fund complex; and (ii) assuming the Fund constituted the
Adviser's only investment company under its management. The Independent Board
Members also considered whether the amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial
profit for the management of the Fund and noted that the Adviser has
substantially increased its resources devoted to Fund matters in response to
recently enacted regulatory requirements and new or enhanced Fund policies and
procedures. The Independent Board Members concluded that the Adviser's
profitability was at an acceptable level. The Independent Board Members also
noted that a substantial portion of the Fund's portfolio transactions were
executed by an affiliated broker, and that the affiliated broker
received commissions from the Fund. The Adviser received a moderate amount of
soft dollar benefits (but no third party research services) from unaffiliated
brokers through the Fund's portfolio brokerage.

BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)
                                   (UNAUDITED)

EXTENT OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE AS FUND GROWS. The Independent Board Members
considered whether there have been economies of scale with respect to the
management of the Fund and whether the Fund has appropriately benefited from any
economies of scale. The Independent Board Members noted that economies of scale
may develop for certain funds as their assets increase and their fund level
expenses decline as a percentage of assets, but that fund level economies of
scale may not necessarily result in Adviser-level economies of scale. They also
recognized that the Adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee on
incremental assets attributable to the preferred shares if the total return of
the common shares does not exceed a specified amount (e.g., the dividend rate
paid on preferred shares). The Independent Board Members concluded that there
was an appropriate sharing of economies of scale.

WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Independent Board Members
also considered whether the management fee rate is reasonable in relation to the
asset size of the Fund and any economies of scale that may exist and concluded
that the Fund's current fee schedule (without breakpoint) was considered
reasonable.

OTHER RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS.

(A) ADVISER PERSONNEL AND METHODS. The Independent Board Members considered the
size, education, and experience of the Adviser's staff, the Adviser's
fundamental research capabilities, and the Adviser's approach to recruiting,
training, and retaining portfolio managers and other research and management
personnel, and concluded that in each of these areas the Adviser was structured
in such a way to support the high level of services being provided to the Fund.

(B) OTHER BENEFITS TO THE ADVISER. The Independent Board Members also considered
the character and amount of other incidental benefits received by the Adviser
and its affiliates from its association with the Fund. The Independent Board
Members considered the brokerage commissions paid to an affiliate of the
Adviser. The Independent Board Members concluded that potential "fall-out"
benefits that the Adviser and its affiliates may receive, such as affiliated
brokerage commissions, greater name recognition, or increased ability to obtain
research services, appear to be reasonable.

CONCLUSIONS. In considering the Advisory Agreement, the Independent Board
Members did not identify any factor as all important or all controlling, and
instead considered these factors collectively in light of the Fund's surrounding
circumstances. Based on this review, it was the judgment of the Independent
Board Members that shareholders had received, over the long term, good absolute
and relative performance at reasonable fees and, therefore, re-approval of the
Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.
As a part of its decision making process, the Independent Board Members noted
that the Adviser has managed the Fund since its inception, and the Independent
Board Members believe that a long term relationship with a capable,
conscientious adviser is in the best interests of the Fund. The Independent
Board Members considered, generally, that shareholders invested in the Fund
knowing that the Adviser managed the Fund and knowing its investment management
fee schedule. As such, the Independent Board Members considered, in particular,
whether the Adviser managed the Fund in accordance with its investment
objectives and policies as disclosed to shareholders. The Independent Board
Members concluded that the Fund was managed by the Adviser consistent with its
investment objectives and policies.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the shareholders

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

    (a)  The registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers,
         or persons performing similar functions, have concluded that the
         registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule

         "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c))) are effective, as of a date within
         90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the disclosure
         required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls
         and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
         270.30a-3(b)) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Securities
