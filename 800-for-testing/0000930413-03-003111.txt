(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return  is
determined by subtracting the initial  investment  from the redeemable  value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial  investment  and
expressing the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that all income
dividends  have been  reinvested at prices  obtained  under the Fund's  dividend
reinvestment  plan. Total investment return does not reflect broker  commissions
or  sales  charges.  Total  return  for a  period  of less  than one year is not
annualized.

An  investment  in the Fund  involves  risk,  including  the loss of  principal.
Investment return,  price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market  conditions.  This data is provided  for  information  only and is not
intended for trading purposes.  Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously  offered.  There is a one-time  public  offering  and once  issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  less total
liabilities  divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market  Price Yield is  determined  by dividing the  annualized  current per
share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share.

NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
August 31, 2003
(unaudited)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nicholas-Applegate  Convertible  & Income Fund (the  "Fund") was  organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on January 17, 2003. Prior to commencing operations
on March 31, 2003, the Fund had no operations other than matters relating to its
organization and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment
company under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended,  and the sale and
issuance of 6,981 shares of beneficial  interest at an aggregate  purchase price
of $100,003 to Allianz  Dresdner  Asset  Management of America,  L.P.  ("ADAM").
PIMCO Advisors Fund  Management  LLC (the  "Investment  Manager")  serves as the
Fund's  investment  manager and is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary of ADAM
which is an indirect,  majority-owned  subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Fund has an
unlimited amount of $0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide total return through a combination
of capital  appreciation  and high current income.  The Fund attempts to achieve
this  objective  by  investing  in  portfolio  of  convertible   securities  and
non-convertible income-producing securities.

The Fund  issued  60,000,000  shares  of common  stock,  in its  initial  public
offering.  An additional  5,345,000  shares were issued in  connection  with the
exercise  of the  underwriters'  over-allotment  option.  These  shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting  discount of $0.675 per share.
Offering costs of $1,600,000 (representing $0.024 per share) were offset against
the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in  capital in excess
of par. The Investment  Manager  agreed to pay all common  offering costs (other
than the sales load) exceeding $0.03 per share.  In addition,  the  underwriters
commission and offering costs  associated with the issuance of Preferred  Shares
in the amounts of $5,250,000  and $525,000,  respectively,  have been charged to
paid-in-capital in excess of par.

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
these  estimates.  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund  enters  into
contracts  that  contain a variety  of  representations  which  provide  general
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown as this would  involve  future  claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be
remote.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund.

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio  securities  and other assets for which market  quotations are readily
available  are  valued  each day at  market  value.  Market  value is  generally
determined  on the basis of the last  reported  sales price,  or if no sales are
reported,   based  on  quotes  obtained  from  a  quotation   reporting  system,
established market makers, or independent pricing services approved by the Board
of Trustees.  Any security or other asset for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  is valued at fair value as  determined  in good faith  under
procedures  established  by the Board of Trustees.  Short-term  debt  securities
having a remaining  maturity of sixty days or less are valued at amortized  cost
or amortized value, which approximates market value.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment  transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on  investments  are determined on the  identified  cost basis.  Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased  are accreted or  amortized  to interest  income over the lives of the
respective securities using the effective interest method.

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies.  Accordingly, no
provision  for  U.S.  federal  income  taxes  is  required.   In  addition,   by
distributing  substantially  all of its ordinary  income and  long-term  capital
gains,  if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends not to be subject to
U. S. federal excise tax.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--COMMON STOCK
The Fund  declares  dividends  from net  investment  income  monthly  to  common
shareholders.  Distributions  of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the  ex-dividend  date.  The amount of dividends and  distributions  from net
investment  income and net realized  capital gains are  determined in accordance
with federal income tax  regulations,  which may differ from generally  accepted
accounting  principles.  These  "book-tax"  differences  are  either  considered
temporary or permanent in nature.  To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature,  such amounts are  reclassified  within the capital accounts based on
their  federal  income  tax  treatment;  temporary  differences  do not  require
reclassification.  To the extent these  dividends  and/or  distributions  exceed
current and  accumulated  earnings  and profits for federal  income tax purposes
they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess
of par.

(unaudited)


(e) CONCENTRATION OF RISK
It is the Fund's  policy to invest  the  majority  of its assets in  convertible
securities.  Although convertible  securities do derive part of their value from
that of the securities into which they are convertible,  they are not considered
derivative  financial  instruments.  However,  certain of the Fund's investments
include  features  which render them more  sensitive  to price  changes in their
underlying  securities.  Thus they expose the Fund to greater downside risk than
traditional convertible  securities,  but still less than that of the underlying
common stock.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
Pursuant to the Investment  Management  Agreement,  the Fund pays the Investment
Manager an annual  management fee, payable monthly,  at the annual rate of 0.70%
of the Fund's average daily total managed assets.  Total managed assets refer to
the total assets of the Fund  (including  assets  attributable  to any Preferred
Shares  or  other  forms of  leverage  that may be  outstanding)  minus  accrued
liabilities  (other than  liabilities  representing  leverage).  The  Investment
Manager has retained its affiliate,  Nicholas-Applegate  Capital  Management LLC
("NACM"),  to manage the Fund's  investments.  For its services,  the Investment
Manager  (not the  Fund)  will pay NACM a  monthly  fee  equal to (i) 50% of the
management fee payable by the Fund to the Investment Manager for such month with
respect to the first $300  million of the Fund's  average  daily  total  managed
assets and (ii) 75% of the  management fee payable by the Fund to the Investment
Manager for such month with respect to the Fund's  average  daily total  managed
assets in excess of $300 million;  provided  however,  that the amounts  payable
under (i) and (ii) above shall be reduced to reflect that NACM will bear 50% and
75%, respectively,  of any "Service or Incentive Fees" payable by the Investment
Manager for such month with respect to the specified total managed  assets.  For
these purposes, "Service or Incentive Fees" for any period equals the sum of any
shareholder servicing fees payable by the Investment Manager to UBS Warburg LLC,
the lead underwriter of the Fund's shares, and any incentive fees payable by the
Investment Manager to other underwriters for such period.

3. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES
For the period ended August 31, 2003, purchases and sales of investments,  other
than short-term securities, were $1,886,185,579 and $417,165,218, respectively.

4. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES
The Fund has issued 4,200 shares of Preferred  Shares  Series A, 4,200 shares of
Preferred  Shares  Series B, 4,200  shares of Preferred  Shares  Series C, 4,200
shares of Preferred Shares Series D, and 4,200 shares of Preferred Shares Series
E each with a net asset and liquidation  value of $25,000 per share plus accrued
dividends.

Dividends are accumulated daily at an annual rate set through auction
procedures. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid
annually.

For the period ended August 31, 2003, the annualized dividend rate ranged from:

                                             High           Low       At 8/31/03
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Series A                                     1.32%          1.05%        1.12%
Series B                                     1.30%          1.03%        1.12%
Series C                                     1.35%          1.00%        1.12%
Series D                                     1.30%          1.00%        1.10%
Series E                                     1.30%          1.05%        1.12%

The Fund is subject to certain  limitations  and  restrictions  while  preferred
shares  are   outstanding.   Failure  to  comply  with  these   limitations  and
restrictions   could   preclude  the  Fund  from   declaring  any  dividends  or
distributions to common  shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share,  generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

5. SUBSEQUENT DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS--COMMON SHAREHOLDERS
On  September  2, 2003,  a dividend  of $0.125 per share was  declared to common
shareholders  payable October 1, 2003 to shareholders of record on September 12,
2003.

On October  1, 2003,  a  dividend  of $0.125  per share was  declared  to common
shareholders  payable  November 3, 2003 to shareholders of record on October 10,
2003.

         the registrant and have:

            (a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
                material information relating to the registrant, including its
                consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
                those entities, particularly during the period in which this

         audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons

            (a) All significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
                internal controls which could adversely affect the registrant's
                ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data
                and have identified for the registrant's auditors any material
                weaknesses in internal controls; and

            (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
                other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
                internal controls; and

6.       The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
         report whether or not there were significant changes in internal
         controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal
