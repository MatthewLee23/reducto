(1)  Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2)  PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return is
determined by subtracting the initial  investment  from the redeemable  value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial  investment  and
expressing the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that all income
dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested at prices obtained
under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan. Total investment  return does not
reflect broker  commissions or sales charges.  Total return for a period of less
than one year is not annualized.

An  investment  in the Fund  involves  risk,  including  the loss of  principal.
Investment return,  price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market  conditions.  This data is provided  for  information  only and is not
intended for trading purposes.  Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously  offered.  There is a one-time  public  offering  and once  issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  less total
liabilities  divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3)  Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common  shareholders  by the market price per common share
at December 31, 2003.

NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2003  (unaudited)


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nicholas-Applegate  Convertible & Income Fund II (the "Fund") was organized as a
Massachusetts  business trust on April 22, 2003. Prior to commencing  operations
on July 31, 2003, the Fund had no operations  other than matters relating to its
organization and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment
company under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended,  and the sale and
issuance of 6,981 shares of beneficial  interest at an aggregate  purchase price
of $100,003 to Allianz  Dresdner  Asset  Management of America,  L.P.  ("ADAM").
PIMCO Advisors Fund  Management  LLC (the  "Investment  Manager")  serves as the
Fund's investment  manager and is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary of ADAM.
ADAM is an indirect,  majority-owned  subsidiary  of Allianz AG. The Fund has an
unlimited amount of $0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide total return through a combination
of capital  appreciation  and high current income.  The Fund attempts to achieve
this  objective  by  investing  in a portfolio  of  convertible  securities  and
non-convertible income-producing securities.

The Fund  issued  55,000,000  shares  of common  stock,  in its  initial  public
offering.  An additional  1,250,000  shares were issued in  connection  with the
exercise  of the  underwriters'  over-allotment  option.  These  shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting  discount of $0.675 per share.
Common offering costs of $1,325,000  (representing $0.024 per share) were offset
against the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital in
excess of par. The Investment  Manager  agreed to pay all common  offering costs
(other  than the sales load) and  organizational  expenses  exceeding  $0.03 per
share.  Because aggregate offering costs and  organizational  expenses were less
than $0.03 per common share, organizational expenses of $25,000 were expensed in
the current period. In addition, the underwriters  commission and offering costs
associated  with the issuance of Preferred  Shares in the amounts of  $5,050,000
and $625,000,  respectively,  have been charged to  paid-in-capital in excess of
par.

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations  which provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is unknown as this would  involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund.

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily  available are stated at market value.  Debt  securities  are valued
daily by an  independent  pricing  service  approved  by the Board of  Trustees.
Prices may be obtained from  independent  pricing services which use information
provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield data
relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. The value of
the Fund's  investments is determined at the close of regular trading (normally,
4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on each day the
NYSEis  open or if no sales  are  reported,  as is the case for most  securities
traded   over-the-counter,   the  mean  between  representative  bid  and  asked
quotations obtained from a quotation reporting system or from established market
makers.  Fixed income  securities,  including  those to be purchased  under firm
commitment agreements,  are normally valued on the basis of quotes obtained from
brokers and dealers or pricing services.  Short-term  investments maturing in 60
days or less are valued at amortized  cost,  which  approximates  market  value.
Certain  fixed  income  securities  for which daily  market  quotations  are not
readily available may be valued, pursuant to guidelines established by the Board
of Trustees, which may include reference to fixed income securities whose prices
are more readily obtainable. The prices used by the Fund to value securities may
differ from the value that would be realized if the securities were sold.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment  transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on  investments  are determined on the  identified  cost basis.  Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased  are accreted or  amortized  to interest  income over the lives of the
respective securities using the effective interest method.

NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2003  (unaudited)

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies.  Accordingly, no
provision  for  U.S.  federal  income  taxes  is  required.   In  addition,   by
distributing  substantially  all of its ordinary  income and  long-term  capital
gains,  if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends not to be subject to
U.S. federal excise tax.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--COMMON STOCK
The Fund  declares  dividends  from net  investment  income  monthly  to  common
shareholders.  Distributions  of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the  ex-dividend  date.  The amount of dividends and  distributions  from net
investment  income and net realized  capital gains are  determined in accordance
with federal income tax  regulations,  which may differ from generally  accepted
accounting  principles.  These  "book-tax"  differences  are  either  considered
temporary or permanent in nature.  To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature,  such amounts are  reclassified  within the capital accounts based on
their  federal  income  tax  treatment;  temporary  differences  do not  require
reclassification.  To the extent these  dividends  and/or  distributions  exceed
current and  accumulated  earnings  and profits for federal  income tax purposes
they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess
of par.

(e) CREDIT-LINKED TRUST CERTIFICATES
Credit-linked  trust  certificates are investments in a limited purpose trust or
other  vehicle  formed  under state law which,  in turn,  invests in a basket of
derivative  instruments,  such as credit default swaps,  interest rate swaps and
other  securities,  in order to  provide  exposure  to the high yield or another
fixed income market.

Like  an  investment  in  a  bond,  investments  in  these  credit-linked  trust
certificates  represent the right to receive  periodic  income  payments (in the
form of  distributions)  and payment of  principal at the end of the term of the
certificate.  However,  these payments are conditioned on the trust's receipt of
payments from, and the trust's potential  obligations to, the  counterparties to
the derivative instruments and other securities in which the trust invests.

(f) CONCENTRATION OF RISK
It is the Fund's  policy to invest  the  majority  of its assets in  convertible
securities.  Although convertible  securities do derive part of their value from
that of the securities into which they are convertible,  they are not considered
derivative  financial  instruments.  However,  certain of the Fund's investments
include  features  which render them more  sensitive  to price  changes in their
underlying  securities.  Consequently,  they expose the Fund to greater downside
risk than traditional  convertible  securities,  but still less than that of the
underlying common stock.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
Pursuant to the Investment  Management  Agreement,  the Fund pays the Investment
Manager an annual  management fee, payable monthly,  at the annual rate of 0.70%
of the Fund's average daily total managed assets.  Total managed assets refer to
the total assets of the Fund  (including  assets  attributable  to any Preferred
Shares  or  other  forms of  leverage  that may be  outstanding)  minus  accrued
liabilities  (other than  liabilities  representing  leverage).  The  Investment
Manager has retained its affiliate,  Nicholas-Applegate  Capital  Management LLC
("NACM"), to manage the Fund's investments.

3. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES
For the period  ended  December 31, 2003,  purchases  and sales of  investments,
other  than  short-term   securities,   were  $1,628,596,549  and  $324,378,513,
respectively.

4. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES
The Fund has issued 4,040 shares of Preferred  Shares  Series A, 4,040 shares of
Preferred  Shares  Series B, 4,040  shares of Preferred  Shares  Series C, 4,040
shares of Preferred Shares Series D, and 4,040 shares of Preferred Shares Series
E each with a net asset and liquidation  value of $25,000 per share plus accrued
dividends.

Dividends  are  accumulated   daily  at  an  annual  rate  set  through  auction
procedures.  Distributions  of net  realized  capital  gains,  if any,  are paid
annually.

NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 2003  (unaudited)


For the period ended  December 31, 2003,  the  annualized  dividend  rate ranged
from:

                                         High           Low       At 12/31/03
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Series A                                 1.50%         1.08%         1.25%
Series B                                 1.51%         1.10%         1.25%
Series C                                 1.49%         0.95%         1.49%
Series D                                 1.49%         1.09%         1.49%
Series E                                 1.50%         1.08%         1.49%

The Fund is subject to certain  limitations  and  restrictions  while  preferred
shares  are   outstanding.   Failure  to  comply  with  these   limitations  and
restrictions   could   preclude  the  Fund  from   declaring  any  dividends  or
distributions to common  shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share,  generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters  affecting  the rights of the Preferred  Shares.

5.  SUBSEQUENT  COMMON  DIVIDEND  DECLARATIONS
On January 2, 2004,  a dividend of  $0.115625  per share was  declared to common
shareholders  payable  February 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on January 16,
2004.

On February 2, 2004,  a dividend of  $0.115625  per share was declared to common
shareholders  payable  March 1, 2004 to  shareholders  of record on February 13,
2004.

6.  SUBSEQUENT  EVENT
On February 12, 2004, the staff of the Securities and Exchange  Commission  (the
"Commission") informed the Investment Manager that it intended to recommend that
the  Commission  bring a civil  administrative  action  against  the  Investment
Manager  and  an  affiliate  of  the  Investment  Manager  seeking  a  permanent
injunction,  disgorgement  plus  prejudgment  interest  and civil  penalties  in
connection with the  Commission's  investigation  of "market timing" and related
trading  activities  in certain  open-end  investment  companies  advised by the
Investment Manager.  There is a substantial  likelihood that the Commission will
bring this action.  The action described above does not allege any inappropriate
activity took place in the Fund and the Fund is not named in the action.

On February  17,  2004,  the  Attorney  General of New Jersey  filed a complaint
alleging,  among other things, that certain affiliates of the Investment Manager
had failed to  disclose  that they  improperly  allowed  certain  hedge funds to
engage in "market timing" in certain open-end investment companies.  On February
20, 2004, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, the Fund and certain of their
affiliates  were named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit filed in
the U.S District Court, District of New Jersey,  relating to the same facts that
are the subject of these regulatory  proceedings.  The lawsuit seeks unspecified
compensatory damages.

In November  2003,  the  Commission  settled an  enforcement  action  against an
unaffiliated  broker-dealer  relating  to the  undisclosed  receipt of fees from
certain mutual fund  companies in return for preferred  marketing of their funds
and announced that it would be investigating mutual funds and their distributors
generally  with  respect to  compensation  arrangements  relating to the sale of
mutual fund shares. In that connection,  the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser
and  certain  of their  affiliates  are under  investigation  by the  Commission
relating  to  directed  brokerage  and  revenue-sharing  arrangements  involving
open-end  investment   companies  they  advise.  The  Investment  Manager,   the
Sub-Adviser  and certain of their  affiliates also have been named as defendants
in  a  putative  class  action   lawsuit  that   challenges  the  brokerage  and
distribution  arrangements  of  open-end  investment  companies  advised  by the
Investment Manager and its affiliates,  including revenue sharing  arrangements.
The  complaint,  filed in U.S.  District  Court,  District  of  Connecticut,  on
February 17, 2004,  generally alleges that the investment adviser to these funds
inappropriately  used  assets  of these  open-end  investment  companies  to pay
brokers to promote the investment companies by directing brokerage  transactions
to such brokers,  and did not fully disclose such  arrangements to shareholders.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified  compensatory  damages. In addition,  the Attorney
General of the State of California has publicly  announced an investigation into
the matters  referenced above. The Fund has not been named in any of the matters
described above.

Additional  lawsuits and regulatory  actions arising out of these  circumstances
and presenting similar  allegations may be filed against the Investment Manager,
the Sub-Adviser and their affiliates, including the Fund.

Although it is not possible to predict what, if any,  effect the foregoing  will
have on the market for the Fund's shares, the Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser
have  notified  the Fund that they do not believe that these  developments  will
have a material  adverse  effect on the  Investment  Manager's or  Sub-Adviser's
ability to perform their respective advisory services to the Fund.

                            FORM N-CSR CERTIFICATION

I, Brian Shlissel, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on the Form N-CSR of the Nicholas- Applegate
     Convertible & Income Fund II;

2.   Based on my knowledge, the report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by the report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods in
     this report:

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
              disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
              supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
              period in which this report is being prepared:

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
              under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
              the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
              financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
              generally accepted accounting principles:

         (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
              controls and procedures and presented in this report our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and

              of this report based on such evaluation; and

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
              control over financial reporting that occurred during the
              registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
              fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process, summarize, and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
              other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
              internal controls over financial reporting.

     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
              disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
              supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
              period in which this report is being prepared:

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
              under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
              the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
              financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
              generally accepted accounting principles:

         (c)  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
              controls and procedures and presented in this report our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
              control over financial reporting that occurred during the
              registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second
              fiscal half-year in the case of an annual report) that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process, summarize, and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
              other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
              internal controls over financial reporting.
