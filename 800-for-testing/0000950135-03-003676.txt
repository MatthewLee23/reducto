THE CHINA FUND, INC.
CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders,

I am happy to announce that the net asset value of The China Fund Inc. increased
by 13.3% in the first half of the current fiscal year. These gains were achieved
despite weak global stock markets, the war in Iraq and, most significantly for
China, severe acute respiratory syndrome ("SARS"). While the SARS virus is
undoubtedly negatively affecting short-term economic growth in China, the
managers of our Fund believe that the panic selling associated with SARS may
have created an unusual opportunity to purchase the best Chinese companies at
bargain prices.

During the last six months, the Fund's share price has risen by 28.3%. This has
resulted in the discount between share price and net asset value per share
narrowing to 4% as of April 30. The Fund briefly traded at a premium, the first
time it has done so since 1996, although the discount has reappeared as of this
writing.

The outbreak of SARS has had some adverse impact on the economy in the second
quarter, but the effect should soon work through. The worst fears that SARS
could damage China's attractiveness as a manufacturing and investment center
should prove unfound. The fundamental attractiveness of the China private equity
market remains in place. The recent reorganization of government structure
intended to increase government efficiency in China is making the market more
attractive for financial investors and capital market reform is expected to
increase the range of exit options for private equity investors. The Direct
Investment Manager continues to identify and invest in new opportunities. In
February 2003, the Fund invested US$2.3 million in Tomoike Industrial (HK) Ltd.,
a growing electronic components manufacturer with facilities in Shanghai,
Suzhou, and Hong Kong. After taking account of dividends received from its
shares in Kowloon Development Company Ltd, the Direct Investment Manager sold
76% of its shares in the company at a small profit. The Direct Investment
Manager is also active in adding value and realizing returns from the previous
Manager's Direct Investment portfolio.

There has been an accompanying improvement, albeit modest, in stock market
liquidity. The response from U.S. and European institutional and individual
investors has been encouraging. We welcome new investors and hope that they find
the Fund to be the most cost-effective way to benefit from China's growth.

We regard clear communication of the Fund's investment strategy as a priority.
We invite you to consult the monthly update on our website
(www.chinafundinc.com), which lists all of the Fund's holdings, or call (toll-
free) 1-888-CHN-CALL (245-2255).

Sincerely,

/s/ Alan Tremain

THE CHINA FUND, INC.
INVESTMENT MANAGERS' STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REVIEW OF LISTED INVESTMENTS

Over the first six months of the fiscal year 2003, the net asset value of our
Fund increased by 13.3%.

Working in favor of the Fund was China's continued strong economic growth. GDP
growth peaked in 2003 Q1 at a heady 9.9% year over year, supported by increasing
domestic consumption and fixed asset investment. Industrial output grew at a
record 17.2% year over year in the first quarter of calendar year 2003. We made
no substantial changes to the structure of the portfolio -- differences in the
list of top ten holdings can be explained more by relative performance than any
stock trading. Some of our largest holdings, such as the internet company, SOHU,
the textile manufacturer, FOUNTAIN SET, and tire maker, CHENG SHIN RUBBER,
performed strongly on major improvements in results. Overall, the portfolio
continues to focus on those companies where management owns equity, avoiding
state-owned companies, and preferring companies catering to domestic demand
rather than exporters.

One factor which was a drag on the Fund was the continued poor performance of
small, private sector companies ("P chips"). Investors have been scared away
from this asset class by a few examples of what often amounts to no more than
poor PR by management, failing to meet over-ambitious targets, issuing new stock
too readily or, occasionally, adopting questionable accounting practices. There
is now extraordinary value in this area because growing companies with little or
no debt are trading on low single digit multiples of earnings and high yields.
As befits a closed-end fund, we are in a position to take a longer-term view,
and continue to accumulate a spread of investments in this area at bargain
prices. The main effect of the Iraq war for China was to cause a rare trade
deficit in 2003 Q1 as, caught with low reserves, China was forced to import oil
hurriedly at high prices. It could also be argued that the U.S.'s need for
China's help with regard to Iraq, North Korea and terrorism in general,
temporarily prevents the U.S. co-operating with Japan to press for Renminbi
appreciation.

More damaging for China than the Iraq war is the SARS epidemic. This has had an
immediate impact on those industries linked to travel or entertainment, but the
effect is now spreading to consumption, investment and even exports, as foreign
investors and buyers cancel trips. The SARS scare has caused panic selling of
Chinese equities. As of the time of this writing, the number of infections seems
to have peaked in Hong Kong but is still increasing in China. But now that the
Chinese authorities have, belatedly, taken action to control the virus, we are
acting on the expectation that the epidemic will come under control within two
to three months, and that pent-up economic activity will then rebound. We
believe, therefore, that the panic may have provided an unusual opportunity to
pick up shares of attractive companies at depressed prices.

REVIEW OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS

The Chinese government has undergone more reorganization with the aim of further
streamlining administration, increasing government efficiency and simplifying
approval process for foreign investments. The new Ministry of Commerce was
formed to replace the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
(MOFTEC) and some internal trade ministries. It will oversee all trade related
issues (foreign and domestic) and should facilitate new inward investment.
Establishment of the State Owned Assets Commission is expected to accelerate
reform of the state owned enterprises (SOE's). The Commission is also expected
to take more steps to dispose of SOE's, which could create investment
opportunities for foreign investors.

Despite positive developments in politics and the economy in the first quarter,
the epidemic of SARS has raised some concerns among investors. It is widely
believed that GDP growth in the second quarter of 2003 will be lower than the
9.9% rate in the first quarter. We are closely monitoring the economic impact of
SARS on retail sales, exports and industrial output, to determine if an
adjustment to our investment strategy is necessary. However, it should be noted
that SARS ought to have a short-term effect on the economy and the long-term
outlook of the Chinese market is still very attractive.

During the last six months, the Fund added one new investment to its Direct
Investments portfolio Tomoike Industrial (HK) Ltd. ("Tomoike"). Tomoike is a
manufacturer of components for the backlight units of mobile phones and sheet
material components for office equipment and household appliances.

A number of developments are reported below in our description of the Fund's
Direct Investment portfolio as of April 30, 2003:

NEW WORLD SUN CITY LIMITED ("NWSC")
NWSC was established to develop Dongguan New World Gardens in Dongguan,
Guangdong Province. Subsequent to the signing of the Share Transfer Agreement on
October 26, 2002 to sell the entire share capital of NWSC, approximately US$1.3
million has been received in relation to the installment sale.

A-S CHINA PLUMBING PRODUCTS LIMITED ("ASPPL")

sanitary ware products in China. The company is a subsidiary of American
Standard Inc. ("ASI"), a U.S. based international manufacturer of plumbing

Notes to Schedule of Investments

  * Denotes non-income producing security

(1) Direct investments are generally restricted as to resale and do not have a
    readily available resale market. On the date of acquisition of each direct
    investment indicated, there were no market quotations on similar securities,
    and such investments were therefore valued at acquisition cost. These direct
    investments are valued at fair value as determined by the Board of Directors
    as discussed in Note A and B to the Financial Statements.

THE CHINA FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE A -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The China Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated under the laws of the State
of Maryland on April 28, 1992, and is a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended. The Fund's investment objective is long-term capital appreciation
through investments in the equity securities of companies engaged in a
substantial amount of business in the People's Republic of China. The following
is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements.

USE OF ESTIMATES:  The preparation of financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
income and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. The significant estimates made as of, and for six months ended, April
30, 2003 relate to the valuation of the Fund's Direct Investments, as further
discussed below and in Note B.

SECURITY VALUATION:  Portfolio securities listed on recognized United States or
foreign securities exchanges are valued at the last quoted sales price in the
principal market where they are traded. Listed securities with no such sales
price and unlisted securities are valued at the mean between the current bid and
asked prices, if any, of two brokers. Short-term investments having maturities
of sixty days or less are valued at amortized cost (original purchase cost as
adjusted for amortization of premium or accretion of discount) which when
combined with accrued interest approximates market value. Securities for which
market quotations are not readily available are valued in good faith at fair
value using methods determined by the Board of Directors. Direct Investments not
traded on an exchange are valued at fair value as determined by the Board of
Directors based on advice from the Direct Investment Manager. The Direct
Investment's original cost is considered to be fair value unless the Board of
Directors, based on such advice, concludes there has been a material change of a
long-term nature and sufficient reliable information is available to revalue
these investments.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS:  The records of the Fund are maintained in U.S.
dollars. Foreign currencies, investments and other assets and liabilities are
translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates. Purchases and sales
of investment securities and income and expenses are translated on the
respective dates of such transactions. Net realized gains and losses on foreign
currency transactions represent net gains and losses from the disposition of
foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized between the trade dates
and settlement dates of security transactions, and the difference between the
amount of net investment income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually
received. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
investments in securities are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from
the effects of changes in market prices of those securities, but are included in
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

OPTIONS CONTRACTS:  The Fund may purchase and write (sell) call options and put
options provided the transactions are for hedging purposes and the initial
margin and premiums do not exceed 5% of total assets. Option contracts are
valued daily and unrealized gains or losses are recorded based upon the last
sales price on the principal exchange on which the options are traded. The Fund
will realize a gain or loss upon the expiration or

                                        17

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

closing of the option contract. When an option is exercised, the proceeds on
sales of the underlying security for a written call option, the purchase cost of
the security for a written put option, or the cost of the security for a
purchased put or call option is adjusted by the amount of premium received or
paid.

The risk in writing a call option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for
profit if the market price of the security increases and the option is
exercised. The risk in writing a put option is that the Fund may incur a loss if
the market price of the security decreases and the option is exercised. The risk
in buying an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is
exercised. Risks may also arise from an illiquid secondary market or from the
inability of counter parties to meet the terms of the contract.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:  Security transactions are recorded
as of the trade date. Realized gains and losses from securities sold are
recorded on the identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date, or, in the case of dividend income on foreign securities, on
the ex-dividend date or when the Fund becomes aware of its declaration. Interest
income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums and discounts are
amortized/accreted for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

Dividend and interest income generated in Taiwan is subject to a 20% withholding
tax. Stock dividends received (except those which have resulted from
Capitalization of capital surplus) are taxable at 20% of the par value of the
stock dividends received. The Fund records the taxes paid on stock dividends as
an operating expense.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS:  The Fund intends to distribute to its
shareholders, at least annually, substantially all of its net investment income
and any net realized capital gains. Income and capital gains distributions are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from
generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, losses deferred due to
wash sales and holdings in passive foreign investment companies.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:  The Fund has qualified and intends to qualify in the
future as a regulated investment company by complying with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code available to certain investment companies, including
making distributions of taxable income and capital gains sufficient to relieve
it from all, or substantially all, federal income and excise taxes.

NOTE B -- VALUATION OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS
At April 30, 2003, Direct Investments amounting to $10,599,701 (6.3% of net
assets) have been valued at fair value as determined by the Board of Directors
in the absence of readily ascertainable market values. The remaining Direct
Investments are being valued at readily available market prices (See Note
A -- Security Valuation). The procedures applied by the Board of Directors in
arriving at its estimate of value of securities without readily available market
values comply with the Fund's policies for valuing Direct Investments at
original cost unless the Board of Directors, based on advice from the Direct
Investment Manager, concludes that there has been a material change of a
long-term nature and sufficient reliable information is available to revalue
these investments. Determination of fair values involves subjective judgment
and, because of the inherent uncertainty

                                        18

of valuation, the Board of Directors' estimated values may differ significantly
from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities
existed, and the differences could be material.

NOTE C -- ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Effective June 30, 2001, Martin Currie assumed its role as manager of the Fund's
listed assets (the "Listed Assets") and is paid a fee, computed weekly and
payable monthly, at the following annual rates: 1.00% of the first US$25 million
of the Fund's average weekly net assets invested in Listed Assets; 0.90% of the
next US$25 million of the Fund's average weekly net assets invested in Listed
Assets; 0.70% of the next US$25 million of the Fund's average weekly net assets
invested in Listed Assets; and 0.50% of the Fund's average weekly net assets
invested in Listed Assets in excess of US$75 million. Prior to June 30, 2001,
HSBC Management served as the Investment Manager for the Fund's Listed Assets
and was paid an annual fee at the rate of 1.10% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets.

On June 15, 2001, the Fund's stockholders approved Asian Direct Capital
Management ("ADCM") as the new investment manager for the Fund's assets
allocated to direct investments. For the period from June 15, 2001 to June 30,
2001, ADCM received a fee for its services under the New Direct Investment
Management Agreement, computed weekly and payable monthly at an annual rate
equal to 1.10% of the average weekly value of the assets of the Fund invested in
direct investments. Effective June 30, 2001, ADCM receives a fee, computed
weekly and payable monthly at an annual rate equal to the greater of $300,000 or
2.2% of the average weekly value of the net assets of the Fund invested in
direct investments. Prior to June 15, 2001, HSBC Private Equity served as the
manager of the Fund's assets allocated to direct investments. HSBC Private
Equity was paid a fee by HSBC Management out of its fee.

No director, officer or employee of the Investment Manager or Direct Investment
Manager or any affiliates of those entities will receive any compensation from
the Fund for serving as an officer or director of the Fund. The Fund pays the
Chairman of the Board and each of the directors (who is not a director, officer
or employee of the Investment Manager or Direct Investment Manager or any
affiliate thereof) an annual fee of $27,500 and $10,000, respectively, plus
$2,000 for each Board of Directors' meeting or Audit Committee meeting attended.
In addition, the Fund reimburses each of the directors for travel and
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending Board of Directors'
meetings.

NOTE F -- INVESTMENTS IN CHINA
The Fund's investments in China companies involve certain risks not typically
associated with investments in securities of U.S. companies or the U.S.
Government, including risks relating to (1) social, economic and political
uncertainty; (2) price volatility, lesser liquidity and smaller market
capitalization of securities markets in which securities of China companies
trade; (3) currency exchange fluctuations, currency blockage and higher rates of
inflation; (4) controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of
invested capital and on the Fund's ability to exchange local currencies for U.S.
dollars; (5) governmental involvement in and control over the economy; (6) risk
of nationalization or expropriation of assets; (7) the nature of the smaller,
less seasoned and newly organized China companies, particularly in China; and
(8) the absence of uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting
standards, practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision
and regulation.

law).

The Fund restricts access to nonpublic personal information about its

provide products or services to shareholders. The Fund maintains physical,
electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard
its shareholders' nonpublic personal information.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS;
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund will distribute to shareholders, at least annually, substantially all
of its net investment income from dividends and interest earnings and expects to
distribute any net realized capital gains annually. Pursuant to the Dividend
Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"), adopted by the Fund, each
shareholder will be deemed to have elected, unless Equiserve Trust Company,
N.A., the Plan Administrator, is otherwise instructed by the stockholder in
writing, to have all distributions automatically reinvested by the Plan
Administrator in Fund shares pursuant to the Plan. Shareholders who do not
participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash paid by check in
U.S. dollars mailed directly to the stockholder by Equiserve Trust Company,
N.A., as paying agent. Shareholders who do not wish to have distributions
automatically reinvested should notify the Fund by contacting Equiserve, c/o The
China Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43011, Providence, Rhode Island 02940-3011. Phone:
1-800-426-5523.

Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. ("Equiserve" or the "Plan Administrator"), a
federally chartered trust institution, acts as Plan Administrator. Equiserve
Inc., an affiliate of Equiserve and a transfer agent registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, acts as Service Agent for Equiserve. If the
Directors of the Fund declare an income dividend or a capital gains distribution
payable either in the Fund's Common Stock or in cash, as shareholders may have
elected, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the
Plan will receive Common Stock, to be issued by the Fund. If the market price
per share on the valuation date equals or exceeds net asset value per share on
that date, the Fund will issue new shares to participants at net asset value or,
if the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price on the valuation
date, then at 95% of the market price. The valuation date will be the dividend
or distribution payment date or, if that date is not a trading day on the
exchange on which the Fund's shares are then listed, the next preceding trading
day. If net asset value exceeds the market price of Fund shares at such time,
participants in the Plan will be deemed to have elected to receive shares of
stock from the Fund, valued at market price on the valuation date. If the Fund
should declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable only in cash,
the Plan Administrator will, as administrator for the participants, buy Fund
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, with the
cash in respect of such dividend or distribution, for the participant's account
on, or shortly after, the payment date.

Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional payments to the
Plan Administrator, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000 for investment
in the Fund's Common Stock. The Plan Administrator will use all funds received
from participants (as well as any dividends and capital gains distributions
received in cash) to purchase Fund shares in the open market on or about January
15 of each year. Any voluntary cash payments received more than thirty days
prior to such date will be returned by the Plan Administrator, and interest will
not be paid on any uninvested cash payments. To avoid unnecessary cash
accumulations, and also to allow ample time for receipt and processing by the
Plan Administrator, it is suggested that participants send in voluntary cash
payments to be received by the Plan Administrator approximately ten days before
January 15. A participant may withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written
notice, if the notice is received by the Plan Administrator not less than 48
hours before such payment is to be invested.

The Plan Administrator maintains all stockholder accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmations of all transactions in the account, including
information needed by shareholders for personal and tax records. Shares in

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS;
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the account of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator in
non-certificated form in the name of the participant, and each stockholder's
proxy will include those shares purchased pursuant to the Plan.

In the case of shareholders, such as banks, brokers or nominees, which hold
shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Administrator will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the stockholder as representing the total amount registered in the
stockholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are
participating in the Plan.

There is no charge to participants for reinvesting dividends or capital gains
distributions. The Plan Administrator's fees for the handling of the
reinvestment of dividends and distributions will be paid by the Fund. However,
each participant's account will be charged a pro rata share of brokerage
commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Administrator's open market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends or capital gains
distributions. A participant will also pay brokerage commissions incurred in
purchases from voluntary cash payments made by the participant. Brokerage
charges for purchasing small amounts of stock for individual accounts through
the Plan are expected to be less than the usual brokerage charges for such
transactions, because the Plan Administrator will be purchasing stock for all
participants in blocks and prorating the lower commission thus attainable.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income tax which may be payable on such dividends and
distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payment made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to
notice of the change sent to all shareholders at least 90 days before the record
date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by the Plan Administrator by at least 90 days' written notice to all
shareholders. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
Equiserve, c/o The China Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43011, Providence, Rhode Island
02940-3011. Phone: 1-800-426-5523.
