Dear Shareholder:

The US stock and bond markets delivered positive, but modest, returns during
the six month period ended May 31, 2006. After a weak fourth quarter, economic
growth turned sharply higher in 2006 and job growth was steady, although
somewhat slower at the end of the period. Confident consumers continued to pump
dollars into US retail markets, despite higher energy prices, which boosted
inflation. The housing market continued to cool as mortgage rates moved higher,
but housing-market indicators--such as housing starts, sales of existing homes,
and house prices--remained strong by historical measures.

In this environment, the US fixed income markets faced the challenge of rising
interest rates, especially within the short-and intermediate-maturity ranges
and was generally flat for the period. The Federal Reserve Board, in an effort
to balance economic growth and the forces of inflation, raised short-term
interest rates by one full percentage point during the reporting period. The
yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, a bellwether for the bond market, moved
up from 4.5% to 5.1%. Lower quality bonds did better than higher quality bonds.
In fact, high-yield bonds did better than either stocks or investment-grade
bonds. A strong economy favored corporate high-yield bonds, as default rates
remained low and corporate profits surprised investors with
better-than-expected results. However, that trend showed signs of shifting near
the end of the six-month period. The municipal sector generated respectable
gains as economic growth helped buoy revenues and stabilize budgets in many
states and municipalities. Within the municipal market, high-yield also
outperformed high-grade bonds for the period.

In the pages that follow, your fund's manager discusses key factors that
influenced performance during this six-month reporting period. We urge you to
read this report carefully and to discuss any questions you might have with
your financial advisor.

As always, we thank you for choosing Colonial Funds. We look forward to
continuing to help you build toward your financial goals.

Sincerely,

/s/ Christopher L. Wilson
Christopher L. Wilson
President, Columbia Funds

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Investments in high-yield or "junk" bonds offer the potential for higher income
than investments in investment-grade bonds, but also have a higher degree of
risk. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely
effect a high-yield bond issuer's ability to make timely principal and interest
payments.

The views expressed in the President's Message and Portfolio Manager's Report
reflect the current views of the respective parties. These views are not
guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that are difficult to predict so actual outcomes and results may
differ significantly from the views expressed. These views are subject to
change at any time based upon economic, market or other conditions and the
respective parties disclaim any responsibility to update such views. These
views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment
decisions for a Colonial Fund are based on numerous factors, may not be relied
on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any particular Colonial
Fund. References for specific company securities should not be construed as a
recommendation or investment advice.

    PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT

SUMMARY

..  For the six-month period ended May 31, 2006, Colonial High Income Municipal
   Trust generated a total return of 8.70%, based on its market price. During
   this period, the trust returned 4.19%, based on investment at net asset
   value. This was less than the 4.41% average return of the Lipper High Yield
   Municipal Debt Funds Category./1/ The trust's performance was much closer to
   the 4.30% average return generated by a customized peer group consisting of
   nine leveraged closed-end high-yield municipal funds that have all issued
   preferred shares. The trust's dividend yield declined as rising short-term
   interest rates cut into some of the income that the trust derived from
   leverage. However, we believe that the trust's leverage continued to give
   the common shareholders a higher dividend payment than would have been
   available without it.

..  Strong gains from the multi-family housing sector and assisted living
   projects bolstered returns. In addition, the trust's slightly longer
   duration (a measure of bond price volatility) helped as long-term municipal
   yields dropped slightly. The trust's slight overweight in higher quality
   issues hampered performance as did its underweight in the volatile airline
   sector. While airline holdings added to total return, the trust had less
   exposure than some of its competitors to this top-performing sector. In
   addition, some nursing home bonds fell due to credit deterioration.

..  At the end of the period, the trust had a slightly higher emphasis than its
   peers on higher quality bonds, which we expect to do well if the difference
   in yields between higher and lower quality bonds widens. We also kept the
   trust's duration slightly longer than its peers because we do not expect
   long-term interest rates to move much higher. We expect the Federal Reserve
   Board to remain vigilant on inflation, which could benefit long-term bonds,
   whose yields tend to reflect inflation expectations.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

Maureen G. Newman has been the portfolio manager of Colonial High Income
Municipal Trust since August 1998.

SHARES OF CLOSED-END FUNDS FREQUENTLY TRADE AT A DISCOUNT TO NET ASSET VALUE.
THE PRICE OF THE TRUST'S SHARES IS DETERMINED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SEVERAL
OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE TRUST. THEREFORE, THE TRUST CANNOT
PREDICT WHETHER ITS SHARES WILL TRADE AT, BELOW OR ABOVE NET ASSET VALUE.

PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY
BE LOWER OR HIGHER. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

Performance is historical, assumes reinvestment of all dividends and capital
gains, and does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal
value fluctuate with changing market conditions so that, when sold, shares may
be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be
lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Please call 800-730-6001 for
the Trust's most recent performance.

Total return based on net asset value reflects changes in the trust's net asset
value during each period. Total return based on market value reflects changes
in market value. These figures will differ depending on the level of any
discount from or premium to during the period.

Sector and quality breakdowns are calculated as a percentage of total
investments. Ratings shown in the quality breakdown represent the rating
assigned to a particular bond by one of the following nationally-recognized
rating agencies: Standard & Poor's, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc., Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Fitch Ratings Ltd. The majority of the
bonds that are non-rated are considered by the advisor to be of non-investment
grade quality. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute
standards of quality. The fund's credit quality does not remove market risk.

       PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT (continued)


Investing in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the
credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic
developments and yield and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest
rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.

Investing in high-yield or "junk" bonds offers the potential for higher income
than investments in investment-grade bonds but they also have a higher degree
of risk. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely
affect a high-yield bond issuer's ability to make timely principal and interest
payments.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-exempt income, but it also involves
special risks. The value of the trust will be affected by interest rate changes
and the creditworthiness of issues held in the fund. Interest income from
certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to certain state and local taxes and,
if applicable, the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains are not exempt from
income taxes.

(a)The Trust changed its fiscal year end from December 31 to November 30.
(b)Per share data was calculated using average shares outstanding during the
   period.
(c)Effective December 1, 2001, the Trust adopted the provisions of the AICPA
   Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began accreting
   market discount on all debt securities. The effect of this change, for the
   year ended November 30, 2002, was to increase the ratio of net investment
   income to average net assets from 8.31% to 8.36% and increase the ratio of
   net investment income (adjusted for dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders) from 7.48% to 7.53%. The impact to net investment income and
   net realized and unrealized loss per share was less than $0.01. Per share
   data and ratios for periods prior to November 30, 2002, have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.
(d)The per share net investment income amount does not reflect the period's
   reclassification of differences between book and tax basis net investment
   income.

          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

May 31, 2006 (Unaudited)

NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION

Colonial High Income Municipal Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts business
trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"), as
amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.

INVESTMENT GOAL

The Trust seeks to provide high current income, generally exempt from federal
income taxes. The Trust's secondary goal is to seek total return.

TRUST SHARES

The Trust may issue an unlimited number of common shares. On August 26, 1999,
the Trust issued 4,800 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial
statements.

SECURITY VALUATION

Debt securities generally are valued by pricing services approved by the
Trust's Board of Trustees, based upon market transactions for normal,
institutional-size trading units of similar securities. The services may use
various pricing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other data, as well as broker quotes. Debt securities for which quotations
are readily available are valued at an over-the-counter or exchange bid
quotation. Certain debt securities, which tend to be more thinly traded and of
lesser quality, are priced based on fundamental analysis of the financial
condition of the issuer and the estimated value of any collateral. Valuations
developed through pricing techniques may vary from the actual amounts realized
upon sale of the securities, and the potential variation may be greater for
those securities valued using fundamental analysis.

Short-term debt obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized
cost, which approximates market value.

Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at net asset value.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by
the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or that have
quotations which management believes are not appropriate, are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures
established by and under the general supervision of the Board of Trustees. If a
security is valued at "fair value", such value is likely to be different from
the last quoted market price for the security.

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Cost is determined
and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification method for both
financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

FUTURES CONTRACTS

The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The
Trust will invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes
in the value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest
rates and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the
transactions are economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in
the management of the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures
contracts involves certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation
between the price movement of the instruments and the underlying securities,
(2) inability to close out positions due to differing trading hours, or the
temporary absence of a liquid market, for either the instrument or the
underlying securities, or (3) an inaccurate prediction by Columbia Management
Advisors, LLC of the future direction of interest rates. Any of these risks may
involve amounts exceeding the variation margin recorded in the Trust's
Statement of Assets and Liabilities at any given time.

Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with the broker in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin requirement.
Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the daily change
in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin receivable or
payable and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust also identifies
portfolio securities as segregated with the custodian in a separate account in
an amount equal to the futures contract. The Trust recognizes a realized gain
or loss when the contract is closed or expires.


                                                                             22

          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

May 31, 2006 (Unaudited)


SWAPS

The Trust may engage in swap transactions such as interest rate, forward, total
return, index or currency swaps, consistent with its investment objective and
policies to obtain a desired return at a lower cost than if the Trust had
invested directly in the asset that yielded the desired return. Swaps involve
the exchange by the Trust with another party of their respective commitments to
pay or receive interest or total return throughout the lives of the agreements.
The interest to be paid or received on swaps is included in net realized
gain/(loss) on investments. Unrealized gains are reported as an asset and
unrealized losses are reported as a liability on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. A realized gain or loss is recorded upon termination of swap
agreements and is equal to the difference between the Trust's basis in the swap
and the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transaction. Swap agreements are
stated at fair value. Notional principal amounts are used to express the extent
of involvement in these transactions, but the amounts potentially subject to
credit risk are much smaller.

If there is a default by the counterparty to a swap contract, the Trust will be
limited to contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the
transaction. There is no assurance that the swap contract counterparties will
be able to meet their obligations pursuant to the swap contracts or that, in
the event of default, the Trust will succeed in pursuing contractual remedies.
The Trust thus assumes the risk that it may be delayed in or prevented from
obtaining payments owed to it pursuant to the swap contracts.

The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statements of assets and
liabilities.

RESTRICTED SECURITIES

Restricted securities are securities that may only be resold upon registration
under federal securities laws or in transactions exempt from registration. In
some cases, the issuer of restricted securities has agreed to register such
securities for resale at the issuer's expense either upon demand by the Trust
or in connection with another registered offering of the securities. Many
restricted securities may be resold in the secondary market in transactions
exempt from registration. Such restricted securities may be determined to be
liquid under criteria established by the Board of Trustees. The Trust will not
incur any registration costs upon such resale.

DELAYED DELIVERY SECURITIES

The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms, including
securities purchased or sold on a "when-issued" basis. This may increase the
risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and causes the
Trust to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices. The Trust identifies
cash or liquid portfolio securities as segregated with the custodian in an
amount equal to the delayed delivery commitment.

INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premium and discount are
amortized and accreted, respectively, on all debt securities. Corporate actions
and dividend income are recorded on the ex-date.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX STATUS

The Trust intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company"
under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and will
distribute substantially all of its taxable income, if any, for its tax year,
and as such will not be subject to federal income taxes. In addition, the Trust
intends to distribute in each calendar year substantially all of its net
investment income, capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, such that
the Trust should not be subject to federal excise tax. Therefore, no federal
income or excise tax provision is recorded.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Distributions
to Auction Preferred shareholders are recorded daily and payable at the end of
each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is generally
seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on May 31, 2006, was 3.35%
for Series T and 3.41% for Series W. For the six months ended May 31, 2006, the
Trust declared dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to
$1,915,402 representing an average dividend rate of 3.23% per APS.

NOTE 3. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended November 30, 2005
was as follows:

<TABLE>
                    <S>                         <C>

Trust under a pricing and bookkeeping agreement. Under a separate agreement
(the "Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State
Street Corporation ("State Street"). As a result, Columbia pays State Street
the total fees collected under the pricing and bookkeeping agreement.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
an annual fee of $38,000 paid monthly plus an additional monthly fee based on
the level of average daily net assets for the month; provided that during any
12-month period, the aggregate fee, exclusive of out-of-pocket expenses and
charges, shall not exceed $140,000.

The Trust also reimburses Columbia and State Street for out-of-pocket expenses
and charges, including fees payable to third parties for pricing the Trust's
portfolio securities and direct internal costs incurred by Columbia in
connection with providing fund accounting oversight and monitoring and certain
other services. For the six months ended May 31, 2006, the annualized effective
pricing and bookkeeping fee rate for the Trust, inclusive of out-of-pocket
expenses, was 0.047% of the Trust's average daily net assets.

CUSTODY CREDITS

The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which custody fees may
be reduced by balance credits. These credits are recorded as a reduction of
total expenses on the Statement of Operations. The Trust could have invested a
portion of the assets utilized in connection with the expense offset
arrangement in an income-producing asset if it had not entered into such an
agreement.

FEES PAID TO OFFICERS AND TRUSTEES

All officers of the Trust, with the exception of the Trust's Chief Compliance
Officer, are employees of Columbia or its affiliates and receive no
compensation from the Trust. The Board of Trustees has appointed a Chief
Compliance Officer to the Trust in accordance with federal securities
regulations. The Trust, along with other affiliated funds, pays its pro-rata
share of the expenses associated with the Chief Compliance Officer. The Trust's
expenses for the Chief Compliance Officer will not exceed $15,000 per year.

The Trust's Trustees may participate in a deferred compensation plan which may
be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan will be paid solely out of
the Trust's assets.

OTHER

Columbia provides certain services to the Trust related to Sarbanes-Oxley
compliance. For the six months ended May 31, 2006, the Trust paid $1,246 to
Columbia for such services. This amount is included in "Other expenses" on the
Statement of Operations.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

For the six months ended May 31, 2006, the cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of securities, excluding short-term obligations, were $64,928,825 and
$35,590,131, respectively.

NOTE 6. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust currently has outstanding 4,800 APS (2,400 shares each of Series T
and W). The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust on any dividend
payment date at the redemption price of $25,000 per share, plus an amount equal
to any dividends accumulated on a daily basis unpaid through the redemption
date (whether or not such dividends have been declared).


                                                                             24

          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

May 31, 2006 (Unaudited)


Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least
200% with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which
any APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more
stringent asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS Agreement and
in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating agencies.
Should these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the APS
not be paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to
common shareholders or may be required to redeem certain APS. At May 31, 2006,
there were no such restrictions on the Trust.

NOTE 7. DISCLOSURE OF SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND CONTINGENCIES

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Trust holds investments that are insured by private insurers who guarantee
the payment of principal and interest in the event of default or that are
supported by a letter of credit. Each of the Trust's insurers is rated Aaa by
Moody's Investor Services Inc., except for Radian Asset Assurance, Inc., which
is rated Aa3. At May 31, 2006, private insurers who insured greater than 5% of
the total investments of the Trust were as follows:

                       Ambac Assurance Corp.     7.1%
</TABLE>

GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATION

The Trust has greater than 5% of its total investments at May 31, 2006 invested
in debt obligations issued by the states of California, Colorado, Florida,
Illinois and Pennsylvania and their respective political subdivisions, agencies
and public authorities. The Trust is more susceptible to economic and political
factors adversely affecting issuers of the specific state's municipal
securities than are municipal bond funds that are not concentrated to the same
extent in these issuers.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES

Investing in high-yield securities may involve greater credit risk and
considerations not typically associated with investing in U.S. government bonds
and other higher quality fixed income securities. These securities are
non-investment grade securities, often referred to as "junk" bonds. Economic
downturns may disrupt the high yield market and impair the ability of issuers
to repay principal and interest. Also, an increase in interest rates would
likely have an adverse impact on the value of such obligations. Moreover,
high-yield securities may be less liquid to the extent that there is no
established secondary market.

INDUSTRY FOCUS

The Trust may focus its investments in certain industries, subjecting it to
greater risk than a trust that is more diversified.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On February 9, 2005, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (which has since merged
into Banc of America Capital Management, LLC (now named Columbia Management
Advisors, LLC)) ("Columbia") and Columbia Funds Distributor, Inc. (which has
been renamed Columbia Management Distributors, Inc.) (the "Distributor")
(collectively, the "Columbia Group") entered into an Assurance of
Discontinuance with the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG
Settlement") and consented to the entry of a cease-and-desist order by the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") (the "SEC Order"). The SEC Order and
the NYAG Settlement are referred to collectively as the "Settlements". The
Settlements contain substantially the same terms and conditions as outlined in
the agreements in principle which Columbia Group entered into with the SEC and
NYAG in March 2004.

Under the terms of the SEC Order, the Columbia Group agreed among other things,
to: pay
$70 million in disgorgement and $70 million in civil money penalties; cease and
desist from violations of the antifraud provisions and certain other provisions
of the federal securities laws; maintain certain compliance and ethics
oversight structures; retain an independent consultant to review the Columbia
Group's applicable supervisory, compliance, control and other policies and
procedures; and retain an independent distribution consultant (see below). The
Columbia Funds have also voluntarily undertaken to implement certain governance
measures designed to maintain the independence of their boards of trustees. The
NYAG Settlement also, among other things, requires Columbia and its affiliates
to reduce management fees for certain Columbia Funds (including the former
Nations Funds) and other mutual funds collectively by $32 million per year for
five years, for a projected total of $160 million in management fee reductions.

Pursuant to the procedures set forth in the SEC order, the $140 million in
settlement amounts described above will be distributed in accordance with a
distribution plan developed by an independent distribution consultant and
approved by the SEC. The independent distribution consultant has been in
consultation with the staff of the SEC and has submitted a proposed plan of
distribution. The SEC has not yet approved a final plan of distribution.

As a result of these matters or any adverse publicity or other developments
resulting from them, the market price of the shares could decline.

A copy of the SEC Order is available on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov.
A copy of the NYAG Settlement is available as part of the Bank of America
Corporation Form 8-K filing on February 10, 2005.

In connection with the events described in detail above, various parties have
filed suit against certain funds, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds,
FleetBoston Financial Corporation and its affiliated entities and/or Bank of
America and its affiliated entities.

On February 20, 2004, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
transferred these cases and cases against several other mutual fund companies
based on similar allegations to the United States District Court in Maryland
for consolidated or coordinated pretrial proceedings (the ''MDL'').
Subsequently, additional related cases were transferred to the MDL. On
September 29, 2004, the plaintiffs in the MDL filed amended and consolidated
complaints. One of these amended complaints is a putative class action that
includes claims under the federal securities laws and state common law, and
that names Columbia, the Distributor, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds, Bank
of America Corporation and others as defendants. Another of the amended
complaints is a derivative action purportedly on behalf of the Columbia Funds
that asserts claims under federal securities laws and state common law.

On February 25, 2005, Columbia and other defendants filed motions to dismiss
the claims in the pending cases. On March 1, 2006, for reasons stated in the
court's memoranda dated November 3, 2005, the U.S. District Court for the
District of Maryland granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions
to dismiss. The court dismissed all of the class action claims pending against
the Columbia Funds Trusts and the Columbia Acorn Trust. As to Columbia, and the
Distributor, the claims under the Securities Act of 1933, the claims under
Sections 34(b) and 36(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("ICA") and the
state law claims were dismissed. The claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and claims under Section 36(b) of the ICA
along with related claims under Section 48(a) of the ICA were not dismissed.

On March 21, 2005, a purported class action was filed in Massachusetts state
court alleging that the conduct, including market timing, entitles Class B
shareholders in certain Columbia funds to an exemption from contingent deferred
sales charges upon early redemption ("the CDSC Lawsuit"). The CDSC Lawsuit has
been removed to federal court in Massachusetts and the federal Judicial Panel
has transferred the CDSC Lawsuit to the MDL.

The MDL is ongoing. Accordingly, an estimate of the financial impact of this
litigation on any fund, if any, cannot currently be made.

In 2004, certain Columbia funds, the Trustees of the Columbia Funds, advisers
and affiliated entities were named as defendants in certain purported
shareholder class and derivative actions making claims, including claims under
the Investment Company and the Investment Advisers Acts of 1940 and state law.
The suits allege, inter alia, that the fees and expenses paid by the funds are
excessive and that the advisers and their affiliates inappropriately used fund
assets to distribute the funds and for other improper purpose. On March 2,
2005, the actions were consolidated in the Massachusetts federal court as In re
Columbia Entities Litigation. The plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended
complaint on June 9, 2005. On November 30, 2005, the judge dismissed all claims
by plaintiffs and ordered that the case be closed. The plaintiffs filed a
notice of appeal on December 30, 2005 and this appeal is pending.

          DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN


COLONIAL HIGH INCOME MUNICIPAL TRUST

Shareholders may elect to have all distributions of dividends and capital gains
automatically reinvested by Computershare (the "Plan Agent"), as agent under
the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). Pursuant to the Plan, the
provisions of which are described below, shareholders not making such an
election will receive all such amounts in cash paid by check mailed directly to
the shareholder by the Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If the Trustees of the Trust declare a dividend or determine to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares of the Trust or in cash, as
shareholders may have elected, nonparticipants in the Plan will receive cash
and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of the
Trust. If the market price of the shares on the payment date for the dividend
or distribution is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, participants will
be issued shares of the Trust at the higher of net asset value or 95% of the
market price. If the net asset value exceeds the market price of Trust shares
at such time, or if the Trust declares a dividend or other distribution payable
only in cash, the Plan Agent will, as agent for Plan participants, buy Trust
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts. If, before the Plan Agent has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of the Trust's shares, the average
per share purchase price paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value
of the Trust's shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Trust. In
circumstances in which the net asset value of Trust shares is more than 5%
below their market price, participants in the Plan will be issued shares
through the Plan at a price exceeding net asset value.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to the
participant's account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be
made for any fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's
notice of election to participate in or withdraw from the Plan must be received
by the Plan Agent before the record date for a dividend in order to be given
effect with respect to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered
in such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who
are to participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting dividends or
distributions. The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of
dividends and distributions will be paid by the Trust. There will be no
brokerage charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Trust as a
result of dividends or distributions payable either in stock or in cash.
However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions
incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market purchases in connection
with the reinvestment of dividends or distributions.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income tax that may be payable on such dividends or
distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days written notice to Plan
participants. Contact the Plan Agent for more information regarding the Plan.
All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to Computershare by
mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010, or by phone at
1-800-730-6001.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

There have not been any material changes to the procedures by which
shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors,
since those procedures were last disclosed in response to the requirements of
Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A or this Item.

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

     (a) The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
         officers, based on their evaluation of the registrant's disclosure
         controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing of
         this report, have concluded that such controls and procedures are
         adequately designed to ensure that information required to be
         disclosed by the registrant in Form N-CSR is accumulated and
         communicated to the registrant's management, including the principal
         executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons
         performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
         regarding required disclosure.

     (b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
         financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's second
         fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
         materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
         registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

    were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
    information included in this report, fairly present in all material
    respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
    assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
    a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
    presented in this report;

4.  The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
    establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
    control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

    (a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
         disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
         supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
         registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
         us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
         which this report is being prepared;

    (b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
         such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
         our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the

         statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
         accounting principles;

    (c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
         and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
         effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
         within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
         evaluation; and

    (d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's

         registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.  The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
    registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
    directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

    (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
         operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
         reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
         record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

    (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
         employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting.
