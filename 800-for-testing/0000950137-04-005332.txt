Item 1. Report to Shareholders.

The Trust's semi-annual report transmitted to shareholders pursuant to Rule
30e-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is as follows:

       Welcome, Shareholder

       In this report, you'll learn about how your investment in Van Kampen
       Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals performed during the
       semiannual period. The portfolio management team will provide an overview
       of the market conditions and discuss some of the factors that affected
       investment performance during the reporting period. In addition, this
       report includes the trust's financial statements and a list of trust
       investments as of April 30, 2004.

       Market forecasts provided in this report may not necessarily come to
       pass. There is no assurance that the trust will achieve its investment
       objective. Trusts are subject to market risk, which is the possibility
       that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and
       that the value of the trust shares may therefore be less than what you
       paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.

       Income may subject certain individuals to the federal Alternative Minimum
       Tax (AMT).

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return, net asset
value (NAV) and common share market price will fluctuate and trust shares, when
sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

As a result of recent market activity, current performance may vary from the
figures shown. For more up-to-date information, please visit vankampen.com or
speak with your financial advisor. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share
market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust
at a given time. Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors,
including supply and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an
investment at the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for
the period in accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale
of all shares at the end of the period.

The Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based statistical
composite of New York municipal bonds. The index is unmanaged and does not
include any sales charges or fees. Such costs would lower performance. It is not
possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2004

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals is managed by the
adviser's Municipal Fixed Income team.(1) Current members include Dennis
Pietrzak, Executive Director; Robert Wimmel, Vice President; and John
Reynoldson, Executive Director.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The state of the U.S. economy remained mixed over the six-month period under
review. On the positive side, economic growth continued to be robust, with Gross
Domestic Product growth topping 4 percent in both the last quarter of 2003 and,
preliminarily, the first quarter of this year. While this strength in output has
historically triggered fears of rising interest rates, yields remained
stubbornly low across the municipal curve. These low yields were partly the
result of the continued low levels of observed inflation in the U.S. economy.
Unfortunately, they also reflected continuing weakness in the job market, which
remained soft throughout the period. The soft job numbers, coupled with
persistently low inflation, led the Federal Open Market Committee (the Fed) to
maintain its accommodative stance throughout the period.

The surprisingly rapid job growth data released in April, coupled with rapidly
rising commodity and high oil prices, led many investors to fear that the Fed
would be forced to raise interest rates earlier than the market initially
expected. As a result, bond yields across all major sectors spiked in April.

Supply of new municipal bonds in calendar 2003 hit record levels as
municipalities moved to take advantage of historically low interest rates. Many
cities and states sought to reduce expenditures by refinancing existing debt and
replacing it with lower-yielding bonds. In other cases, municipalities attempted
to meet current and future funding needs by issuing new debt. This activity
slowed in the first months of 2004.

The low interest rates that prevailed over much of the period also had an impact
on the demand for municipal bonds. Retail and institutional investor activity
slowed as holders of municipal bonds saw little reason to sell bonds purchased
at higher yield levels and reinvest at lower yields. However, the period was
marked by rising activity among non-traditional investors, such as hedge funds
and insurance companies seeking to take advantage of the attractiveness of
municipal bonds relative to some taxable securities. Additionally, investors'
search for yield led to significant outperformance by lower-rated bonds with
greater credit risk. Sectors such as health care, with a preponderance of
lower-rated issues, performed particularly well.

<PAGE>

The New York economy continued to struggle with fiscal problems during the
period, and the executive and legislative branches of the state government
remained locked in their perennial budget battle. Signs of economic improvement
in the rest of the country may bode particularly well for New York, since the
state's tax revenues are in large part driven by revenues from the financial
sector. The state continued to be among the country's largest issuers as local-
and state-level projects sought funding for their ongoing operations.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

Closed-end fund returns can be calculated based upon either the market price or
the net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing
the value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while market
price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ significantly. On both an NAV basis and a market-price basis,
the trust underperformed its benchmark, the Lehman Brothers New York Municipal
Bond Index. (See table below.)

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are typically reinvested in longer-term securities, taking
advantage of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. With
short-term rates at historic lows for much of the period, the difference between
short- and longer-term rates was relatively high. This made using leverage a
profitable approach in the early months of the period, and added to the trust's
returns.

As yields rose toward the end of the period, the prices of bonds declined. The
trust's use of leverage magnified this negative price movement, leading to a
total return slightly lower than that of its benchmark, which is not leveraged.

Our analysis of the macroeconomic environment, coupled with the levels of
interest rates near multi-decade lows, led us to believe that interest rates
were more likely to rise than to fall further. As a result, we kept the trust's
duration (a measure of interest-rate sensitivity) below that of its benchmark in
order to limit the potentially damaging impact of any increase in interest
rates. This approach hampered the trust's returns for much of the period as
interest rates fell; however, it helped buoy returns when interest rates soared
in the final weeks of the period.

The trust's performance was also modestly hampered by its bias, relative to the
benchmark, toward high-quality securities. Municipal bond investors during the
period responded to the improving economy by reducing the yield spreads between
higher and lower-rated bonds (yield spreads reflect the premium demanded by
investors to buy lower-rated bonds). As a result, lower-quality bonds
outperformed. The portfolio had approximately 83 percent exposure to bonds rated
AA/Aa or higher at the end of the period.

We also adjusted the portfolio's term structure in anticipation of rising
interest rates. Our research showed that the intermediate portion of the curve
offered the most promising total-return potential. As a result, we focused our
purchases on the 13- to 18-year segment of the curve. Many of the securities we
identified had the added appeal of premium coupons and 10-year call dates, which
served to add income to the portfolio while limiting its interest-rate exposure.

Our trading activity during the period was well below traditional norms because
we wanted to avoid having to reinvest into securities with low yields. That
said, we were able to make selective relative-value trades among securities and
sectors as they moved into and out of fair value.

The trust's portfolio remained well diversified during the period, with its
holdings spread across many major municipal bond sectors. We believe this
long-standing strategy helps to minimize the risk of over-concentration in any
single sector, while also giving the portfolio exposure to as many potential
sources of return as possible. The three largest sector exposures at the end of
the period were transportation, general purpose and public building.

As mentioned above, the portfolio's below-market duration served it well in the
final weeks of the period, when interest rates rose sharply. While it is
impossible to predict how long this trend will hold, we believe that the trust
is well positioned to weather further increases in rates. We look forward to
becoming more active in seeking attractive structures and relative-value trading
opportunities now that rates have moved into a more normal range.

                                                                               5

(a)As required, effective November 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   accreting market discount on fixed income securities. The effect of this
   change for the period ended October 31, 2002 was to increase net investment
   income per share by $.01, decrease net realized and unrealized gains and
   losses per share by $.01 and increase the ratio of net investment income to
   average net assets applicable to common shares by .05%. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for periods prior to October 31, 2002 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(b)Total return assumes an investment at the common share market price at the
   beginning of the period indicated, reinvestment of all distributions for the
   period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of
   all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the period
   indicated.

(c)Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders.

(d)Ratios reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(e)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust") is
registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to provide a high level of current income exempt from
federal as well as New York State and New York City income taxes, consistent
with preservation of capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its
assets in New York municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of
investment. The Trust commenced investment operations on March 27, 1992.
Effective November 30, 2003, the Fund's investment adviser, Van Kampen
Investment Advisory Corp. merged into its affiliate, Van Kampen Asset
Management.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At April 30, 2004, the Trust had no when-issued and delayed
delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

of the Trust. In addition, the Trust pays a monthly administrative fee to Van
Kampen Investments Inc. or its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen"), the

of the Trust. Effective June 1, 2004, the administrative fee was reduced from
..05% to .00%.

    For the six months ended April 30, 2004, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $5,100 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher, & Flom LLP, counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of the
Trust is an affiliated person.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser

representing Van Kampen's cost of providing accounting and legal services to the
Trust, which are reported as part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively,

5. PREFERRED SHARES

("APS"). Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate is generally reset every
28 days through an auction process. The rate in effect on April 30, 2004 was
..950%. During the six months ended April 30, 2004, the rates ranged from 0.750%
to 1.400%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in Common Shares of the Trust. The Trust declares dividends out of
net investment income, and will distribute annually net realized capital gains,
if any. Common Shareholders may join or withdraw from the Plan at any time.

    If you decide to participate in the Plan, State Street Bank and Trust
Company, as your Plan Agent, will automatically invest your dividends and
capital gains distributions in Common Shares of the Trust for your account.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE

    If you wish to participate and your shares are held in your own name, call
1-800-341-2929 for more information and a Plan brochure. If your shares are held
in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your
nominee to see if it would participate in the Plan on your behalf. If you wish
to participate in the Plan, but your brokerage firm, bank or nominee is unable
to participate on your behalf, you should request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name which will enable your participation in the Plan.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    Participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in Common Shares valued
on the valuation date, generally at the lower of market price or net asset
value, except as specified below. The valuation date will be the dividend or
distribution payment date or, if that date is not a trading day on the national
securities exchange or market system on which the Common Shares are listed for
trading, the next preceding trading day. If the market price per Common Share on
the valuation date equals or exceeds net asset value per Common Share on that
date, the Trust will issue new Common Shares to participants valued at the
higher of net asset value or 95% of the market price on the valuation date. In
the foregoing situation, the Trust will not issue Common Shares under the Plan
below net asset value. If net asset value per Common Share on the valuation date
exceeds the market price per Common Share on that date, or if the Board of
Trustees should declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable to the
Common Shareholders only in cash, participants in the Plan will be deemed to
have elected to receive Common Shares from the Trust valued at the market price
on that date. Accordingly, in this circumstance, the Plan Agent will, as agent
for the participants, buy the Trust's Common Shares in the open market for the
participants' accounts on or shortly after the payment date. If, before the Plan
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset value
per share of the Common Shares, the average per share purchase price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value

                                                                              19

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN continued

of the Trust's Common Shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer Common
Shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
issued by the Trust. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common Shares
and are carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
changes sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90 days before the
record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by the Plan Agent by at least 90 days written notice to all Common
Shareholders of the Trust.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
prorata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's
open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    Plan participants may withdraw at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by
writing State Street Bank and Trust Company, P.O. Box 8200, Boston, MA
02266-8200. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan and a cash payment will be made for any fractional Common
Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the
Trust at:
