EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS as of March 31, 2004

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]

Thomas J. Fetter
President

Amid the market volatility of recent years, many investors have become more
concerned with risk management. That trend has been especially true in the
municipal bond market, where the use of bond insurance has become increasingly
common. Today, roughly half of all municipal bond issuance is composed of
insured bonds. As part of our continuing educational series, we thought it might
be helpful to discuss bond insurance and its impact on the municipal market.

THE USE OF BOND INSURANCE HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY OVER THE YEARS...

Municipal bond insurance was initially developed in 1971, when AMBAC Assurance
Corp., the nation's first municipal insurer, offered insurance as a way to
guarantee principal and interest payments on bond issues in the event of a bond
default. Over the following three decades, the municipal market has witnessed a
surge in the use of insurance. For example, in 1980, just 3% of all municipal
issuance was insured. However, by late 2003, that figure had risen to roughly
50%. Insurance has clear benefits for purchasers: the elimination of default
risk of the underlying issuer, AAA quality ratings and an enhancement of an
issue's liquidity. (It's important to note that, while insured bonds are insured
as to principal and interest payments, they still remain subject to interest
rate and market risks.)

THE MECHANICS OF MUNICIPAL BOND INSURANCE...

We start with the underlying reality that an issuer with a AAA credit rating
will pay less in interest expense than an issuer with a lower credit rating.
Thus, an issuer must first determine whether purchasing insurance is financially
feasible. That is, will the interest savings offset the cost of insurance? If
so, the issuer must then qualify for insurance. Just as an individual must
qualify for insurance, so must a bond issuer meet certain criteria. The issuer
provides key financial data and documents to potential insurers that are then
used to assess the issuer's financial strength and underlying fundamentals. If
the issuer qualifies, insurance is then effected by "direct purchase," with the
payment of a one-time premium by the issuer. The premium fee is calculated as a
percentage of the value of the bond issue - typically, around 50 basis points
(0.50%), but more if the credit entails higher risk. (An alternative method of
purchase involves "elective bidding," in which the insurance is purchased by
bond dealers, who determine at the time the bond is sold whether it is more
attractive as an insured or uninsured bond.)

IN-DEPTH CREDIT ANALYSIS INCLUDES INSURERS AS WELL AS BOND ISSUERS...

When analyzing municipal bonds, an investor naturally researches the issuer's
fundamentals. However, if the bond is insured, the analyst is concerned with the
soundness of the insurer as well. At Eaton Vance, analysis of the insured
segment is an integral part of our total municipal research effort. Research
includes, among other areas, analysis of an insurer's claims-paying ability, its
capital structure and the overall quality of its portfolio of policies. Based on
claims-paying ability, there are currently six bond insurers rated AAA by
Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings - the nation's
leading rating agencies.

INSURERS CAN PLAY A VALUABLE ROLE IN STRUCTURING BOND DEALS AND IMPROVING CREDIT
QUALITY...

Insurers play an important role in capital formation for municipal borrowers,
working closely with municipal officials to forge deals that raise capital for
vital projects at affordable interest rates. In so doing, the insurers can help
states and municipalities achieve more efficient fiscal management. Insurers
often re-structure bond deals by insisting on provisions that are intended to
make the deal more secure. That has proved a major benefit to investors in
recent years. In a more risk-conscious climate, we believe that an ongoing
analysis of the insured market is a necessary discipline to invest successfully
in today's municipal market.

                                        Sincerely,

                                        /s/ Thomas J. Fetter
                                        Thomas J. Fetter
                                        President

MARKET RECAP

U.S. economic activity continued to make progress in the six months ended March
31, 2004, although the pace of the recovery was a topic of strong debate.
Businesses increased capital spending, reinvesting in plants and equipment.
Meanwhile, consumer spending remained very resilient, despite deepening concerns
over the continuing conflict in Iraq, slow job growth and sharply rising
gasoline prices. However, the investment climate remained generally positive
and, against this backdrop, the bond market generated solid returns during the
period.

THE CONSTRUCTION AND BUSINESS SERVICE SECTORS WERE AMONG THE LEADERS IN JOB
GROWTH...

Construction employment, while subject to seasonal fluctuations, contributed
strongly to the economy. Gains were also seen in the service sector, where
business services, health care, education, retailing and leisure showed
strength. Interestingly, temporary employment agencies reported some weakness,
suggesting that employers may be increasingly inclined to begin hiring permanent
employees. The manufacturing sector remained lackluster. However, hopes rose
that recent trends showing less deterioration might mark an end to the
relentless job losses dating to 2000.

WHILE KEEPING INTEREST RATES AT A RECORD LOW, THE FEDERAL RESERVE CONTINUED TO
MONITOR THE ECONOMY CLOSELY FOR INFLATION...

The nation's Gross Domestic Product grew by 4.2% in the first quarter of 2004,
following a 4.1% rise in the fourth quarter of 2003. While the data suggested a
sound overall economy, the slow pace of job creation remained a concern. The
nation's unemployment rate was 5.7% in March 2004, down just 0.1% from 5.8% a
year earlier. Recent labor market data have been unusually volatile. The Federal
Reserve is likely to keep a close eye on future jobs reports - as well as prices
of key commodities and consumer goods - for signs of a return of inflation. Late
in the period, inflation appeared to be edging somewhat higher, especially
energy, transportation and clothing costs. Nevertheless, through March, the
Federal Reserve held its Federal Funds rate - a key short-term interest rate
barometer - at 1.00%, where it has stood since June 2003.

MUNICIPAL BOND YIELDS NEARLY EQUALLED TREASURY YIELDS

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
SOURCE BLOOMBERG, L.P.

The municipal bond market performed generally in line with the Treasury market
during the six-month period ended March 31, 2004. Ten-year Treasury bond yields
- - which were around 3.93% at September 30, 2003 - declined to 3.83% by March 31,
2004, while 10-year municipal yields fell from 3.76% to 3.64%. The Lehman
Brothers Municipal Bond Index posted a total return of 3.12% for the six months
ended March 31, 2004.*

STATE TAX RATES ROSE AGAIN IN 2003, INCREASING THE BURDEN ON STATE TAXPAYERS...

While federal taxes declined, state taxes rose significantly in 2002 and 2003,
according to the Tax Foundation. Over the past decade, the fastest growing
category of state tax collections was individual income taxes, which rose at an
average annual rate of 7.7%. That trend has left taxpayers with a larger state
tax bill and made a strong case for municipal bonds as one of the few remaining
ways to pare one's tax burden. Thus, we continue to believe that municipal bonds
remain a worthwhile consideration for tax-conscious investors.

  * It is not possible to invest directly in an Index.

INVESTMENT UPDATE

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  While some measures suggested the U.S. economy was slowly recovering, job
   growth remained sluggish. The nation's manufacturing sector continued to shed
   jobs, while global outsourcing took an increasing toll on the technology and
   service sectors. The nation's jobless rate was 5.7% in March 2004, down from
   5.8% a year ago.

- -  Insured* transportation bonds remained the Fund's largest sector weighting at
   March 31, 2004. These issues financed upgrades needed for the nation's vital
   transportation grid, and represented a wide range of projects, including
   highways, turnpikes, toll bridges, rapid transit and urban monorails.

- -  Insured* general obligation bonds (GOs) remained a key emphasis for the Fund.
   In a slow recovery, many states and municipalities have faced lower income
   and sales tax receipts. Insured* GOs provided a measure of insulation from
   those revenue-related uncertainties.

- -  Insured* electric utility bonds were a significant investment. Electric power
   issues are attractive to investors in an uncertain economy because they
   represent an essential service, a non-discretionary expenditure backed by
   utility bill payments.

- -  The Fund emphasized a broad diversification by sector, issuer and coupon
   allocation. Management maintained a balance between current coupon issues and
   zero-coupon issues for appreciation potential.

THE FUND

PERFORMANCE FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS

- -  Based on share price (traded on the American Stock Exchange), the Fund had a
   total return of 11.04% for the six months ended March 31, 2004. That return
   was the result of an increase in share price to $14.59 on March 31, 2004 from
   $13.58 on September 30, 2003, and the reinvestment of $0.469 in regular
   monthly dividends.(3)

EATON VANCE INSURED CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL BOND FUND as of March 31, 2004

INVESTMENT UPDATE

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  The California economy saw stagnant job growth in 2003, as the manufacturing,
   government, information and entertainment sectors struggled. Construction,
   financial services, leisure, tourism and selected service sectors led the way
   in job creation. The state's March 2004 jobless rate was 6.5%, down from 6.8%
   a year ago.

- -  Insured* general obligation bonds (GOs) were the Fund's largest sector
   weighting at March 31, 2004. The Fund's holdings focused on school district
   and college district bond issues, diversified among large urban issuers as
   well as smaller communities throughout the state.

- -  Insured* lease revenue/certificates of participation (COPs) were prominent
   investments. These instruments provide a mechanism for financing, whereby
   communities can achieve cost-effective funding for public projects.

- -  The Fund maintained a significant investment in essential services bonds,
   including insured* water and insured* sewer issues. Because the revenues for
   these issues are based on fees and water payments, they are considered less
   subject to economic fluctuations.

- -  The Fund continued its efforts toward broad diversification according to
   market sector and issuer. Management also made adjustments as warranted to
   the Fund's coupon structure to reflect changing market conditions.

EATON VANCE INSURED NEW YORK MUNICIPAL BOND FUND as of March 31, 2004

INVESTMENT UPDATE

Thomas J. Fetter
Portfolio Manager

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  The New York economy improved in 2003 and early 2004, although job creation
   was sporadic. The pace of hiring in the key financial services and
   manufacturing sectors remained central to the still-evolving recovery of the
   New York economy. The state's March 2004 jobless rate was 6.5%, up slightly
   from 6.3% a year ago.

- -  Insured* transportation bonds were the Fund's largest sector weighting at
   March 31, 2004. The Fund's investments included port authorities, tunnel and
   bridge authorities, the state thruway and New York City rapid transit bonds.
   These facilities handle huge daily volumes of passenger and freight traffic
   and, therefore, play a key role in the state's economy.

- -  The Fund had large investments in insured* private education bonds.
   Investments focused largely on Dormitory Authority bonds, one of New York's
   largest sources of municipal issuance. These investments funded projects for
   some of the state's finest universities.

- -  Insured* hospital bonds represented a large commitment for the Fund. The
   hospital industry has seen a trend toward cost containment. The Fund
   emphasized institutions we believe have sound financial structures, good
   management and in-demand health care specialties.

- -  In the slow recovery, the Fund has been well served by its broad
   diversification. In addition to diversifying according to issuer, sector and
   insurer, management maintained a well-diversified coupon allocation.

XLCA - XL Capital Assurance, Inc.

The Fund invests primarily in debt securities issued by municipalities. The
ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their obligations may be
affected by economic developments in a specific industry or municipality. In
order to reduce the risk associated with such economic developments, at March
31, 2004, 84.5% of the securities in the portfolio of investments are backed by
bond insurance of various financial institutions and financial guaranty
assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by an individual financial
institution ranged from 0.4% to 24.7% of total investments.

(1)  Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
     requirements on open financial futures contracts.

The Fund invests primarily in debt securities issued by California
municipalities. The ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their
obligations may be affected by economic developments in a specific industry or
municipality. In order to reduce the risk associated with such economic
developments, at March 31, 2004, 86.4% of the securities in the portfolio of
investments are backed by bond insurance of various financial institutions and
financial guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by an
individual financial institution ranged from 14.5% to 28.1% of total
investments.

(1)  Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
     requirements on open financial futures contracts.

The Fund invests primarily in debt securities issued by New York municipalities.
The ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their obligations may
be affected by economic developments in a specific industry or municipality. In
order to reduce the risk associated with such economic developments, at March
31, 2004, 85.2% of the securities in the portfolio of investments are backed by
bond insurance of various financial institutions and financial guaranty
assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by an individual financial
institution ranged from 3.6% to 33.0% of total investments.

(1)  Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
     requirements on open financial futures contracts.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.
(2)  For the period from the start of business, August 30, 2002, to September
     30, 2002.
(3)  Net asset value at beginning of period reflects the deduction of the sales
     load of $0.675 per share paid by the shareholder from the $15.000 offering
     price.
(4)  Total investment return on net asset value is calculated assuming a
     purchase at the offering price of $15.000 less the sales load of $0.675 per
     share paid by the shareholder on the first day and a sale at the net asset
     value on the last day of the period reported. Total investment return on
     market value is calculated assuming a purchase at the offering price of
     $15.000 less the sales load of $0.675 per share paid by the shareholder on
     the first day and a sale at the current market price on the last day of the
     period reported. Total investment return on net asset value and total
     investment return on market value are not computed on an annualized basis.
(5)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in net asset value or market value with all distributions
     reinvested. Total return is not computed on an annualized basis.
(6)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Fund's leveraged capital structure.
(7)  Annualized.
(8)  Calculated by subtracting the Fund's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Fund's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.
(9)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS as of March 31, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Insured Municipal Bond Fund (Insured Municipal Fund), Eaton Vance
   Insured California Municipal Bond Fund (Insured California Fund), and Eaton
   Vance Insured New York Municipal Bond Fund (Insured New York Fund),
   (individually referred to as the Fund or collectively the Funds) are
   registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), as
   amended, as non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies. The
   Insured Municipal Fund was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of
   Massachusetts by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated July 2, 2002.
   The Insured California Fund and the Insured New York Fund were organized
   under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and
   Declaration of Trust dated July 8, 2002. Each Fund's investment objective is
   to achieve current income exempt from regular federal income tax, including
   alternative minimum tax, and taxes in its specified state. Each Fund seeks to
   achieve its objective by investing primarily in high grade municipal
   obligations that are insured as to the timely payment of principal and
   interest.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
   followed by each Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
   policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
   valuations furnished by a pricing service. Futures contracts listed on the
   commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement prices. Interest rate
   swaps are normally valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a broker.
   Short-term obligations, maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at
   amortized cost, which approximates value. Investments for which valuations or
   market quotations are unavailable are valued at fair value using methods
   determined in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

   B INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Fund instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   C INCOME -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
   adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

   D FEDERAL TAXES -- Each Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable, if any, and
   tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments. Therefore,
   no provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At September 30,
   2003, the Funds, for federal income tax purposes, had a capital loss
   carryover which will reduce taxable income arising from future net realized
   gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue
   Code and thus will reduce the amount of distributions to shareholders which
   would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Funds of any liability for
   federal income or excise tax. The amounts and expiration dates of the capital
   loss carryovers are as follows:

<Table>

   FUND                               AMOUNT              EXPIRES
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   <S>                                <C>                 <C>
   Insured Municipal                  $     1,076,715     September 30, 2011
   Insured California                         672,504     September 30, 2011
   Insured New York                         1,251,495     September 30, 2011
</Table>

   Additionally, at September 30, 2003, Insured Municipal Fund, Insured
   California Fund and Insured New York Fund had net capital losses of
   $6,521,683, $4,261,210 and $164,124, respectively, attributable to security
   transactions incurred after October 31, 2002. These are treated as arising on
   the first day of each Fund's taxable year ending September 30, 2004.

   In addition, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable it to
   designate distributions from the interest income generated by its investments
   in municipal obligations, which are exempt from regular federal income taxes
   when received by each Fund, as exempt-interest dividends.

   E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Funds in connection with the
   offerings of the common shares and preferred shares were recorded as a
   reduction of capital paid in excess of par applicable to common shares.

   F FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
   contract, a Fund is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
   securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or

                                       27
<Page>

   received by a Fund (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by a Fund. A Fund's investment in
   financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging against anticipated
   future changes in interest rates and investment purposes. Should interest
   rates move unexpectedly, a Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of
   the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

   G USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   H INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under each Fund's organizational documents, its
   officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and
   expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to each Fund and
   shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for the obligations
   of each Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, each Fund
   enters into agreements with service providers that may contain
   indemnification clauses. Each Fund's maximum exposure under these
   arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
   against each Fund that have not yet occurred

   I EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Funds. Pursuant to the respective custodian agreements, IBT
   receives a fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average
   daily cash balances each Fund maintains with IBT. All significant credit
   balances used to reduce the Funds' custodian fees are reported as a reduction
   of total expenses in the Statement of Operations.

   K INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- The interim financial statements relating
   to March 31, 2004 and for the six months then ended have not been audited by
   independent certified public accountants, but in the opinion of the Funds'
   management reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
   adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   Each Fund issued Auction Preferred Shares on October 29, 2002 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discounts and other offering costs were recorded
   as a reduction of the capital of the common shares of each Fund. Dividends on
   the APS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established
   at the offering of each Fund's APS and have been reset every seven days
   thereafter by an auction. Special dividend periods were set on the following
   series:

   The APS are redeemable at the option of each Fund at a redemption price equal
   to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
   payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if any Fund is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the

                                       28
<Page>

   dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full
   years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a
   majority of the Board of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the
   Common Shares have equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the
   holders of the APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two
   members of the Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of
   $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. Each Fund is
   required to maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as
   defined in each Fund's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. Each
   Fund pays an annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares
   liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
   auction.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

   Each Fund intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payments of any dividends on any outstanding APS. Distributions are
   recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distribution to preferred shareholders are
   recorded daily and are payable at the end of each dividend period. Each
   dividend payment period for the APS is generally seven days. Insured
   Municipal Fund Series B and Series D shares and Insured New York Series A
   shares set a special dividend period of 364 days effective March 2, 2004,
   August 7, 2003 and August 4, 2003, respectively. Insured Municipal Fund
   Series C shares set a special dividend period of 728 days effective August 6,
   2003. Insured Municipal Fund Series B, Series C, Series D and Insured New
   York Fund Series A will pay each Series' accumulated dividends on the first
   business day of each month. The applicable dividend rate for APS on March 31,
   2004 are listed below. For the six months ended March 31, 2004, the amount of
   dividends each Fund paid to Auction Preferred shareholders and average APS
   dividend rates for such period were as follows:

   The Funds distinguish between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.65% of each
   Fund's average weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM) as compensation for investment advisory services rendered to each Fund.
   Except for Trustees of each Fund who are not members of EVM's organization,
   officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services to each Fund
   out of such investment adviser fee. For the six months ended March 31, 2004,
   the fee was equivalent to 0.65% (annualized) of each Fund's average weekly
   gross assets and amounted to $5,061,963, $1,658,640, and $1,207,123 for
   Insured Municipal Fund, Insured

                                       29
<Page>

   California Fund and Insured New York Fund, respectively. EVM also serves as
   the administrator of the Funds, but currently receives no compensation.

   In addition, EVM has contractually agreed to reimburse the Fund for fees and
   other expenses in the amount of 0.32% of average weekly gross assets of each
   Fund during the first five full years of each Fund's operations, 0.24% of
   average weekly gross assets of each Fund in year six, 0.16% in year seven and
   0.08% in year eight. For the six months ended March 31, 2004, EVM
   contractually waived $2,492,043, $816,561 and $594,277 of its advisory fee
   for Insured Municipal Fund, Insured California Fund and Insured New York
   Fund, respectively

   Certain officers and one Trustee of each Fund are officers of the above
   organization.

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   Each Fund may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in
   the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure
   to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures
   contracts and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of
   the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or
   contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment each Fund
   has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily
   represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the
   risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related
   and offsetting transactions are considered.

   A summary of obligations under these financial instruments at March 31, 2004
   is as follows:

EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Each Fund offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
automatically reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the same Fund. You may
elect to participate in the Plan by completing the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Application Form. If you do not participate, you will receive all distributions
in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc. as dividend paying
agent. On the distribution payment date, if the net asset value per Share is
equal to or less than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, then new Shares will be issued. The number of Shares shall be
determined by the greater of the net asset value per Share or 95% of the market
price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased on the open market by the
Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if any) are taxable whether or
not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with each Fund's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by each
Fund. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquiries regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 [is/will be]
available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2)

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 [is/will be]
available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2)
on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Effective February 9, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees
formalized the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees
to the registrant's Board of Trustees. The Governance Committee shall, when
identifying candidates for the position of Independent Trustee, consider any
such candidate recommended by a shareholder of a Fund if such recommendation
contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the
Secretary of the Fund.
