                               GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

                               Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                               structure combines the specialized expertise of
                               three world-class investment management groups--
                               Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE          Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                               autonomously, relying on its own research and
                               staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                               that underlie its success.

                               FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                               recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                               also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                               U.S. equity investing.

                               TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                               international investing and, in 1954, launched
                               what has become the industry's oldest global
                               fund. Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                               Templeton offers investors a truly global
                               perspective.

                               MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                               dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                               searching aggressively for opportunity among what
                               it believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                               arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION           Because our management groups work independently
                               and adhere to different investment approaches,
                               Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
                               typically have distinct portfolios. That's why
                               our funds can be used to build truly diversified
                               allocation plans covering every major asset
                               class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST      At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                               consistently provide investors with exceptional
                               risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                               as the reliable, accurate and personal service
                               that has helped us become one of the most trusted
                               names in financial services.

Important Notice to Shareholders

EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS

The Fund may invest up to 10% of its total assets in shares of exchange-traded
funds (ETFs) for the purpose of short-term cash management. The Fund will use
ETFs when the investment manager determines that the Fund will benefit from
market exposure when there is excess cash in the Fund and the investment manager
is not able to invest in a single stock fast enough because either the stock is
not liquid enough to accommodate a large purchase or the Fund would cause
excessive market impact in trying to invest cash in a single stock immediately
(referred to as "equitizing cash"). This strategy can allow the investment
manager to be more selective in the securities it buys for the Fund and the
prices paid because the investment manager is not forced to buy stocks at any
price just to get market exposure. The Fund may also use ETFs to provide the
Fund with liquidity during volatile markets without having to hold
underperforming cash.

An investment in an ETF generally represents the same risks as an investment in
a conventional fund (i.e., an investment company that is not exchange-traded).
The price of an ETF can fluctuate and the Fund could lose money investing in an
ETF if the prices of the securities owned by the ETF go down. In addition, ETFs
are subject to certain other risks that do not apply to conventional funds, such
as the risk that the market price of the ETF's shares may trade at a discount to
their net asset value; the risk that an active market for an ETF's shares may
not develop or be maintained; or the risk that an ETF's shares could be delisted
from an exchange or that trading may be halted for various reasons.

Most ETFs are investment companies. Therefore, the Fund's purchases of ETFs are
subject to limitations on investments in other investment companies under
section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, unless exemptions from those limitations are
available pursuant to the SEC's current rules, exemptions and interpretations
under the 1940 Act.

Important Notice to Shareholders (CONTINUED)

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

The Fund's Board previously authorized management to implement an open-market
share repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase Fund shares,
from time to time, in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management.
This authorization remains in effect.

Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to bring you Templeton Dragon Fund's annual report for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2007.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Templeton Dragon Fund posted cumulative total returns of +31.69% in market price
terms and +43.22% in net asset value terms for the 12 months under review. You
can find the Fund's long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on
page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

In 2007, Chinese equities had another positive year, with the Chinese market
emerging as one of the top performers globally. Stock prices were supported by a
robust macroeconomic environment, significant investment inflows and rising
commodity prices. Periods of increased volatility, however, occurred during the
year as nervous investors reacted to government efforts to curb heated share
prices in the domestic A share markets as well as concerns surrounding the U.S.
subprime lending crisis and its impact on the global economy.

China's expansion of the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII)
program to allow domestic fund managers and brokerages to invest in foreign
securities provided a boost to the Hong Kong-listed China H and Red Chip shares
due to significant investment flows from mainland investors. 1

1. "China H" denotes shares of China-incorporated, Hong Kong-listed companies
with most businesses in China. "Red Chip" denotes shares of Hong Kong-listed
companies with significant exposure to China. China H and Red Chip shares are
traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS ARE LISTED IN THE FUND'S STATEMENT OF INVESTMENTS (SOI). THE

However, the government's decision to delay implementation of the Qualified
Domestic Retail Investor (QDRI) program, which would have allowed mainland
investors to invest in Hong Kong-listed shares, dampened investor sentiment in
the latter part of the year.

The Hong Kong stock market benefited from ample liquidity, strong gross domestic
product growth and lower interest rates, which also supported property prices.
Taiwan, however, underperformed its peers in 2007. A slow recovery in the
technology sector coupled with political uncertainty and concerns over the
global economic outlook drove investors away from the market.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources, profit
margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government regulation,
management and other factors in comparison to other companies around the world
that we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

For the 12 months under review, the Fund's exposure to the energy,
telecommunication services, food and staples retailing, and capital goods
sectors contributed significantly to absolute performance. 2 In the energy
sector, Sinopec (China Petroleum and Chemical), the country's largest integrated
energy company, CNOOC, China's biggest offshore oil and natural gas exploration
and production company, and China Shenhua Energy, the country's principal coal
producer, were among the largest contributors to performance. Rising oil prices
and growing demand for oil and coal in China as well as other emerging markets
benefited these companies.

2. The energy sector comprises oil, gas and consumable fuels in the SOI. The
telecommunication services sector comprises diversified telecommunication
services and wireless telecommunication services in the SOI. The capital goods
industry comprises electrical equipment, industrial conglomerates and machinery
in the SOI.


4 | Annual Report

<PAGE>

China Mobile, the country's and the world's largest wireless telecommunication
company by number of subscribers, was the Fund's top contributor during the
period. In the food and staples retailing sector, the Fund's only sector
position was in Dairy Farm International Holdings, which operates supermarkets,
drugstores, convenience stores and restaurants in Asia. The stock performed well
largely due to greater private consumption in the region. Capital goods
companies that recorded significant price appreciation during the reporting
period included industrial conglomerates Citic Pacific and Shanghai Industrial
Holdings.

Sectors that detracted from Fund performance during the reporting period
included semiconductors and semiconductor equipment; food, beverage and tobacco;
and consumer durables and apparel. 3 The largest detractors in the
semiconductors industry were Novatek Microelectronics, TSMC (Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International.
These out-of-favor stocks traded at what we considered low valuations on
concerns of their near-term business outlook. Despite the current stock
weakness, company fundamentals had not weakened. Consistent with our long-term
strategy, we continued to hold these stocks as we believed patient investors
would likely be rewarded over the longer term. People's Food Holdings, one of
China's biggest meat processing companies, and Samson Holdings, a leading
residential furniture wholesaler, also detracted from performance as both stocks
declined in value during the period. We sold the Fund's position in Samson by
period-end as rising cost pressure weakened the company's competitiveness. We
continued to hold People's Food because we believed the impact of high pork
prices on its business was only temporary.

During the reporting period, we made significant purchases in China H shares as
we believed these companies should be key beneficiaries of China's QDII program
expansion. Additions included shares of major commercial banks China
Construction Bank and Bank of China, Dongfeng Motor, one of the country's
leading automobile manufacturers, and PetroChina, a dominant player in the
upstream oil and gas sector.

From a sector perspective, we increased the Fund's allocations to several
sectors based on what we considered favorable market trends. With commodity
prices expected to stay at relatively high levels and growing global energy
demand, we increased our investments in the oil, gas and consumable fuels

3. The food, beverage and tobacco sector comprises food products in the SOI. The
consumer durables and apparel sector comprises textiles, apparel and luxury
goods in the SOI.


                                                               Annual Report | 5

industry. Greater global demand for consumer products and services also led us
to increase our allocation to packaged foods and meats, integrated
telecommunication services and automobile manufacturing companies. 4 We also
added select Taiwanese semiconductors and computer hardware companies based on
what we considered attractive valuations. 5

To raise funds for income and capital gains distribution in 2007, we sold a
number of holdings. These sales also allowed the Fund to focus on stocks we
considered relatively more attractively valued within our investment universe.
We sold select positions as stocks reached sale price targets. As a result, the
Fund's exposure to the diversified banking, electric utilities, and life and
health insurance industries fell. 6 Major sales included all or part of China
Mobile, HSBC Holdings, one of the world's largest banking and financial services
organizations, and Datang International Power Generation, China's premier
electric utility.

Thank you for your continued participation in Templeton Dragon Fund. We look
forward to serving your future investment needs.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (Fund) is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a non-diversified, closed-end investment
company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. The investment manager monitors price movements
following the close of trading in foreign stock markets through a series of
country specific market proxies (such as baskets of American Depository
Receipts, futures contracts and exchange traded funds). These price movements
are measured against established trigger thresholds for each specific market
proxy to assist in determining if an event has occurred. If such an event
occurs, the securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may
include the use of independent pricing services. All security valuation
procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
dividend and interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based
on the tax regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the
Fund invests.


                                                              Annual Report | 17

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date except that certain dividends from foreign
securities are recognized as soon as the Fund is notified of the ex-dividend
date. Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are
determined according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable
earnings determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences
are reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These
reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the results of operations.
Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent
periods.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. CAPITAL STOCK

At December 31, 2007, there were 100 million shares authorized ($0.01 par
value). Transactions in the Fund's shares were as follows:

                                     -----------------------------------------

2. CAPITAL STOCK (CONTINUED)

The Fund's Board of Directors previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and
December 31, 2006, there were no shares repurchased.

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.


                                                              Annual Report | 19

5. INCOME TAXES

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions taken on federal income tax returns, for
each of the open tax years and as of December 31, 2007 and has determined that
no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial statements.

For tax purposes, realized currency losses occurring subsequent to October 31,
may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following
fiscal year. At December 31, 2007, the Fund deferred realized currency losses of
$59,705.

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31, 2007

7. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by Franklin
Advisers, Inc. (an affiliate of the investment manager). Management fees paid by
the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the Sweep Money Fund, in an amount
not to exceed the management and administrative fees paid by the Sweep Money
Fund.

8. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

9. REORGANIZATION TO A DELAWARE STATUTORY TRUST

On May 29, 2002, the Board of Directors approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (Agreement) whereby the Fund would be reorganized and its
domicile changed from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The
completion of the reorganization is pending quidance from the National Tax
Agency in Japan relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws
with respect to the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization
is completed, the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

10. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and marketing support payments to
securities dealers who sell fund shares ("marketing support"), Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"),
entered into settlements with certain of those regulators and governmental
entities. Specifically, the Company entered into settlements with the SEC, among
others, concerning market timing and marketing support.

On June 6, 2007, the SEC posted for public comment the proposed plan of
distribution for the market timing settlement. Once the SEC approves the final
plan of distribution, disbursements of settlement monies will be made promptly
to individuals who were shareholders of the designated funds during the relevant
period, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the settlement and plan.


                                                              Annual Report | 21

10. REGULATORY AND LITIGATION MATTERS (CONTINUED)

In addition, the Company, as well as most of the mutual funds within Franklin
Templeton Investments and certain current or former officers, Company directors,
fund directors, and employees, have been named in private lawsuits (styled as
shareholder class actions, or as derivative actions on behalf of either the
named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.). The lawsuits relate to the industry
practices referenced above.

The Company and fund management believe that the claims made in each of the
private lawsuits referenced above are without merit and intend to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. If it is determined that the Company bears responsibility for any
unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is
committed to making the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

11. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In September 2006, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157), which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Fund
believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will have no material impact on its financial
statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") at December 31, 2007, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2007 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan, unless he elects to withdraw.
Shareholders holding their shares through Japan Securities Depository Center,
Inc., will not be enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and
they elect to participate. If shares are registered in the name of a
broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the broker-dealer or
nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the shareholder's behalf unless
the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless the reinvestment service is
not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact BNY Mellon Shareholder Services, P.O. Box 358035,
Pittsburgh, PA 15252-8035, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Administrator must
receive written notice within 10 business days before the record date for a
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
BNY Mellon Shareholder Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009,
Attention: Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator shall apply such
payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees)
to purchases of the Fund's shares on the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

Under Section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund
designates the maximum amount allowable but no less than $102,475,962 as a long
term capital gain dividend for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.

Under Section 871(k)(2)(C) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $16,254,656 as a short term capital gain dividend for
purposes of the tax imposed under Section 871(a)(1)(A) of the Code for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2007.

Under Section 854(b)(2) of the Code, the Fund designates the maximum amount
allowable but no less than $6,152,277 as qualified dividends for purposes of the
maximum rate under Section 1(h)(11) of the Code for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2007. In January 2008, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV
which will include their share of qualified dividends distributed during the
calendar year 2007. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors
for information on the treatment of these amounts on their individual income tax
returns.

At December 31, 2007, more than 50% of the Fund's total assets were invested in
securities of foreign issuers. In most instances, foreign taxes were withheld
from income paid to the Fund on these investments. As shown in the table below,
the Fund designates to shareholders the foreign source income and foreign taxes
paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the Code. This designation will allow
shareholders of record on December 21, 2007, to treat their proportionate share
of foreign taxes paid by the Fund as having been paid directly by them. The
shareholder shall consider these amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year
in which they receive the Fund distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis of foreign tax paid, foreign
source income, and foreign qualified dividends as designated by the Funds, to
Class A shareholders of record.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

Foreign Source Income Per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends that have not been adjusted for the
rate differential applicable to such dividend income. 1

Foreign Qualified Dividends Per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund. 1

In January 2008, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2007. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been adjusted for the rate differential on foreign source qualified dividend
income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2007 individual income
tax returns.

1 Qualified dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (5% for those in the
10% and 15% income tax bracket). In determining the amount of foreign tax credit
that may be applied against the U.S. tax liability of individuals receiving
foreign source qualified dividends, adjustments may be required to the foreign
tax credit limitation calculation to reflect the rate differential applicable to
such dividend income. The rules however permit certain individuals to elect not
to apply the rate differential adjustments for capital gains and/or dividends
for any taxable year. Please consult your tax advisor and the instructions to
Form 1116 for more information.

         (iv) establishment by the audit committee, if deemed necessary or
appropriate, as an alternative to committee pre-approval of services to be

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.   N/A

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Templeton Asset Management Ltd. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of
another independent third party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy
directly to the Fund with a recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If
the conflict is not resolved by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter,
along with the recommended course of action by the manager to an
interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include portfolio managers
and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting
instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation
of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third party provider
of proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group
or the Proxy Review Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the
instructions of a representative of the Fund, such as the board of directors or
a committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on Sections 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, or pursuant to
an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests uninvested cash in affiliated
money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive order ("cash sweep
arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's governing documents
or applicable law. Echo voting means that the Investment Manager will vote the
shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the other holders of the
fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

</TABLE>

1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the individual managers listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures helps to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. As noted above, the separate management of the trade
execution and valuation functions from the portfolio management process also
helps to reduce potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected
for funds or accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected
for the Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         a Franklin Templeton fund which vest over a three-year period (17.5% to
         25%) and other mutual fund shares (17.5% to 25%). The deferred
         equity-based compensation is intended to build a vested interest of the
         portfolio manager in the financial performance of both Franklin
         Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The bonus plan is
         intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus compensation
         that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving consistently strong
         investment performance, which aligns the financial incentives of the
         portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief Investment Officer
         of the manager and/or other officers of the manager, with
         responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of annual
         bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin Templeton
         guidelines. The following factors are generally used in determining
         bonuses under the plan:

         o INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Primary consideration is given to the
           historic  investment  performance  over the 1, 3 and 5  preceding
           years of all  accounts  managed  by the  portfolio  manager.  The
           pre-tax  performance of each fund managed is measured relative to
           a relevant peer group and/or applicable benchmark as appropriate.

         o NON-INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The more qualitative contributions of
           a portfolio manager to the manager's business and the investment
           management team,  including business  knowledge,  contribution to
           team efforts,  mentoring of junior staff, and contribution to the
           marketing of the Fund, are evaluated in determining the amount of
           any bonus award.

         o RESEARCH.  Where the portfolio management team also has research
           responsibilities,  each  portfolio  manager is  evaluated  on the
           number and performance of recommendations over time.

         o RESPONSIBILITIES. The characteristics and complexity of funds
           managed by the  portfolio  manager are factored in the  manager's
           appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds,
         and options to purchase common shares of a Franklin Templeton fund.
         Awards of such deferred equity-based compensation typically vest over
         time, so as to create incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager (such amounts may change from time to time):

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 2005

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
