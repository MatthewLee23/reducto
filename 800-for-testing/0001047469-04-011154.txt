(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value at
the end of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and
expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all income
dividends have been reinvested at prices obtained under the Fund's dividend
reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not reflect broker commissions
or sales charges. Total return for a period of less than one year is not
annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share
at January 31, 2004.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS:
+    The cost basis of portfolio securities for federal income tax purposes is
     $591,246,438. Aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for securities in
     which there is an excess of value over tax cost is $4,924,288; aggregate
     gross unrealized depreciation for securities in which there is an excess of
     tax cost over value is $359,656; net unrealized appreciation for federal
     income tax purposes is $4,564,632.
(a)  Private Placement. Restricted as to resale and does not have a readily
     available market; the aggregate cost and value of such securities is
     $386,284,493 or 64.8% of investments.
(b)  Participation interests were acquired through the financial institution
     indicated parenthetically.
(c)  These securities generally pay interest at rates which are periodically
     re-determined by reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These
     base lending rates are generally either the lending rate offered by one or
     more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate
     ("LIBOR") or the prime rate offered by one or more major United States
     banks, or the certificate of deposit rate. These securities are generally
     considered to be restricted as the Fund is ordinarily contractually
     obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or borrower prior to
     disposition.
(d)  Fair-valued security
(e)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
     1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from

PIMCO FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
January 31, 2004 (unaudited)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PIMCO Floating Rate Income Fund (the "Fund") was organized as a Massachusetts
business trust on June 19, 2003. Prior to commencing operations on August 29,
2003, the Fund had no operations other than matters relating to its organization
and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment company
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of 5,168 shares of
beneficial interest at an aggregate purchase price of $100,001 to Allianz
Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P. ("ADAM"). PIMCO Advisors Fund
Management LLC (the "Investment Manager") serves as the Fund's Investment
Manager and is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is an
indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Fund has an unlimited
amount of $0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

The Fund's investment objective is to seek high current income, consistent with
the preservation of capital by investing primarily in floating rate debt
instruments, a substantial portion of which will be senior floating rate loans.
The ability of the issuers of the Fund's investments to meet their obligations
may be affected by economic developments in a specific industry.

The Fund issued 16,250,000 shares of common stock, in its initial public
offering. An additional 1,500,000 shares were issued in connection with the
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. These shares were all
issued at $20.00 per share before an underwriting discount of $0.65 per share.
Common offering costs of $710,000 (representing $0.04 per share) were offset
against the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital in
excess of par. The Investment Manager agreed to pay all offering costs (other
than the sales load) and organizational expenses exceeding $0.04 per share.
Because aggregate offering costs and organizational expenses exceeded $0.04 per
common share, all organizational expenses and offering costs in excess of $0.04
per common share were reimbursed by the Investment Manager. In addition, the
underwriters' commission and offering costs associated with the issuance of
Preferred Shares in the amounts of $2,100,000 and $500,000, respectively, have
been charged to paid-in capital in excess of par.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily available are stated at market value. The Fund's investments in
senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans") are valued in accordance with
guidelines established by the Board of Trustees. Under the Fund's guidelines,
Senior Loans for which a secondary market exists will be valued at the mean of
the last available bid and asked prices in the market for such Senior Loans, as
provided by a Board-approved independent pricing service. Other Senior Loans are
valued at fair value by the Fund's Sub-Adviser, pursuant to procedures approved
by the Board of Trustees. Such procedures include consideration and evaluation
of: (1) the creditworthiness of the borrower and any intermediate participants;
(2) the term of the Senior Loan; (3) recent prices in the market for similar
loans, if any; (4) recent prices in the market for loans of similar quality,
coupon rate, and period until next interest rate reset and maturity, and (5)
general economic and market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior
Loan. Other portfolio securities and financial instruments are valued by an
independent pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees, dealer
quotations, or are valued at the last sale price on the exchange that is the
primary market for such securities, or the last quoted bid price for those
securities for which the over-the-counter market is the primary market or for
listed securities in which there were no sales. Independent pricing services use
information provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained
from yield data relating to investments or securities with similar
characteristics. Short-term investments maturing in 60 days or less are valued
at amortized cost, if their original maturity was 60 days or less, or by
amortizing their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if the original term
to maturity exceeded 60 days. Securities for which market quotations are not
readily available or if a development/significant event occurs that
significantly impacts the value of a security may be fair valued, pursuant to
guidelines established by the Board of Trustees. The prices used by the Fund to
value securities may differ from the value that would be realized if the
securities were sold. The Fund's net asset value is

                                       18
<Page>

determined weekly on the last business day of the week at the close of regular
trading (normally, 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on the New York Stock Exchange.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased are accreted or amortized to interest income over the lives of the
respective securities using the effective interest method. Facility fees and
other fees (such as consent fees, origination fees and amendment fees) received
by the Fund are amortized as income over the expected term of the loan.
Commitment fees received by the Fund relating to unfunded purchase commitments
are deferred and amortized to facility fee income over the period of the
commitment.

(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to distribute all of its taxable income and to comply with the
other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S.
federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing substantially all
of its ordinary income and long-term capital gains, if any, during each calendar
year the Fund intends not to be subject to U.S. federal excise tax.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Fund declares dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net
investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in accordance
with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are either considered
temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on
their income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require
reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed current
and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes, they are
reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess of par.

(e) SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATIONS
When the Fund purchases a loan participation, the Fund typically enters into a
contractual relationship with the lender or third party selling such
participations ("Selling Participant"), but not the borrower. As a result, the
Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower, the Selling Participant and any
other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the borrower. The Fund may
not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the senior loan in which it
has purchased the loan participation.

(f) CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS
The Fund enters into credit default swap contracts ("swaps") for investment
purposes, to manage its credit risk or to add leverage.

As a seller in the credit default swap contract, the Fund would be required to
pay the par or other agreed-upon value of a referenced debt obligation to the
counterparty in the event of a default by a third party, such as a U.S. or
foreign corporate issuer, on the referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund
would receive from the counterparty a periodic stream of payments over the term
of the contract provided that no event of default has occurred. If no default
occurs, the Fund would keep the stream of payments and would have no payment
obligations.

The Fund may also purchase credit default swap contracts in order to hedge
against the risk of default of debt securities held, in which case the Fund
would function as the counterparty referenced in the preceding paragraph. As a
purchaser of a credit default swap contract, the Fund would receive the par or
other agreed upon value of a referenced debt obligation from the counterparty in
the event of default by a third party, such as a U.S. or foreign corporate
issuer on the referenced debt obligation. In return, the Fund would make
periodic payments to the counterparty over the term of the contract provided no
event of default has occurred. Such periodic payments are accrued daily and
charged to realized gains and losses.

Swaps are marked to market daily by the Fund's Investment Manager based upon
quotations from market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Fund's Statement of Operations.
For a credit default swap sold by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon amount
made by the Fund in the event of default of the referenced debt obligation is
recorded as the cost of the referenced debt obligation purchased/received. For a
credit default swap purchased by the Fund, the agreed upon amount received by
the Fund in the event of default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded
as proceeds from sale/delivery of the referenced debt obligation and the
resulting gain or loss realized on the referenced debt obligation is recorded as
such by the Fund.

                                       19
<Page>

Entering into swaps involves, to varying degrees, elements of credit, market and
documentation risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Such risks involve the possibility that there will be no
liquid market for these agreements, that the counterparty to the agreements may
default on its obligation to perform or disagree as to the meaning of the
contractual terms in the agreements, and that there may be unfavorable changes
in net interest rates.

(g) FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS
The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for the purpose of
hedging against foreign currency risk arising from the investment or anticipated
investment in securities denominated in foreign currencies. The Fund may also
enter into these contracts for purposes of increasing exposure to a foreign
currency or to shift exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one country
to another. A forward foreign currency contract is an agreement between two
parties to buy and sell a currency at a set exchange rate on a future date. The
market value of a forward foreign currency contract fluctuates with changes in
forward currency exchange rates. All commitments are marked to market daily at
the applicable exchange rates and any resulting unrealized gains and losses are
recorded. Realized gains or losses are recorded at the time the forward contract
matures or by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering these
contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign
currency relative to the U.S. dollar.

(h) CREDIT-LINKED TRUST CERTIFICATES
Credit-linked trust certificates are investments in a limited purpose trust or
other vehicle formed under state law which, in turn, invests in a basket of
derivative instruments, such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and
other securities, in order to provide exposure to the high yield or another
fixed income market.

Like an investment in a bond, investments in these credit-linked trust
certificates represent the right to receive periodic income payments (in the
form of distributions) and payment of principal at the end of the term of the
certificate. However, these payments are conditioned on the trust's receipt of
payments from, and the trust's potential obligations to, the counterparties to
the derivative instruments and other securities in which the trust invests.

(i) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS
The Fund may enter into transactions with its custodian bank or securities
brokerage firms approved by the Board of Trustees whereby it purchases
securities under agreements to resell at an agreed upon price and date
("repurchase agreements"). Such agreements are carried at the contract amount in
the financial statements. Collateral pledged (the securities received), which
consists primarily of U.S. government obligations and asset backed securities,
are held by the custodian bank until maturity of the repurchase agreement.
Provisions of the repurchase agreements and the procedures adopted by the Fund
require that the market value of the collateral, including accrued interest
thereon, is sufficient in the event of default by the counterparty. If the
counterparty defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if the
counterparty enters an insolvency proceeding, realization of the collateral by
the Fund may be delayed or limited.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
The Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager to serve as the Fund's Investment Manager. Subject
to the supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees, the Investment Manager is
responsible for managing, either directly or through others selected by it, the
investment activities of the Fund and the Fund's business affairs and other
administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Investment Manager will
receive an annual fee, payable monthly, at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's
average weekly total managed assets. Total managed assets refer to the total
assets of the Fund (including assets attributable to any Preferred Shares or
other forms of leverage that may be outstanding minus accrued liabilities (other
than liabilities representing leverage). The Investment Manager has retained its
affiliate, Pacific Investment Management Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser") to
manage the Fund's investments. Subject to the supervision of the Investment
Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all investment decisions. The Investment Manager
(not the Fund) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the Sub-Adviser in
return for its services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.39% of the Fund's
average weekly total managed assets for the period from commencement of
operations through August 31, 2008. Commencing September 1, 2008, the Investment
Manager will pay the Sub-Adviser a monthly fee at the annual rate of 0.55% of
the Fund's average weekly total managed assets. The Investment Manager informed
the Fund that it paid the Sub-Adviser $748,354 in connection with its
sub-advisory services for the period ended January 31, 2004.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

5. SUBSEQUENT COMMON DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS
On February 6, 2004, a dividend of $0.076943 per share was declared to common
shareholders payable March 5, 2004 to shareholders of record on February 20,
2004.

On March 5, 2004, a dividend of $0.07684 per share was declared to common
shareholders payable April 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on March 19, 2004.

6. SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On February 12, 2004, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") informed the Investment Manager that it intended to recommend that
the Commission bring civil and administrative actions against the Investment
Manager and one of its investment advisory affiliates seeking a permanent
injunction against violations of certain provisions of the federal securities
laws, disgorgement plus prejudgement interest and civil penalties in connection
with the Commission staff's investigation of "market timing" and related trading
activities in certain open-end investment companies advised by the Investment
Manager (the "Subject Funds").

On February 17, 2004, the Attorney General of New Jersey filed a complaint
alleging, among other things, that the Sub-Adviser and certain of its affiliates
had failed to disclose that they improperly allowed certain hedge funds to
engage in "market timing" in the Subject Funds and certain other mutual funds
advised by the Sub-Adviser. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, civil
monetary penalties, restitution and disgorgement of profits.

The proceedings described above do not allege that any inappropriate activity
took place in the Fund and the Fund is not named in the proceedings.

If the New Jersey Attorney General or the Commission were to obtain a court
injunction against the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser or certain of their
affiliates, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and their affiliates would,
in the absence of exemptive relief granted by the Commission, be barred from
serving as an investment adviser/sub-adviser or principal underwriter for any
registered investment company, including the Fund. In such a case, the
Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser would in turn seek exemptive relief from
the Commission, as contemplated by the Investment Company Act, although there is
no assurance that such exemptive relief would be granted. The Commission also
has the power by order to prohibit the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser
from serving as investment advisers and underwriters, although to date it has
not exercised such powers with respect to market timing arrangements involving
other mutual fund complexes.

Since February, 2004, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and certain of
their affiliates, open-end investment companies advised by the Investment
Manager or Sub-Adviser (the "Open-End Funds"), their boards of trustees and
other mutual funds advised by the Investment Manager or the Sub-Adviser have
been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in
the Southern District of New York, the Central District of California and the
Districts of New Jersey and Connecticut. The lawsuits have been commenced as
putative class actions on behalf of investors who purchased, held or redeemed
shares of the specified funds during specified periods or as derivative actions
on behalf of the specified funds. The lawsuits generally relate to the same
facts that are the subject of the regulatory proceedings discussed above. The
lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages plus interest and, in some cases,
punitive damages, the rescission of investment advisory contracts, the return of
fees paid under those

                                       22
<Page>

contracts and restitution. The Fund has been named in two of the class action
lawsuits, one filed in the Southern District of New York and one filed in the
District of New Jersey.

In November 2003, the Commission settled an enforcement action against an
unaffiliated broker-dealer relating to the undisclosed receipt of fees from
certain mutual fund companies in return for preferred marketing of their funds
and announced that it would be investigating mutual funds and their distributors
generally with respect to compensation arrangements relating to the sale of
mutual fund shares. In that connection, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser
and certain of their affiliates are under investigation by the Commission
relating to revenue-sharing arrangements and the use of brokerage commissions to
recognize brokers effecting sales of the Open-End Funds advised by the
Investment Manager or the Sub-Adviser. In addition, the Attorney General of the
State of California has publicly announced an investigation into the Open-End
Funds brokerage recognition and revenue-sharing arrangements.

The Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and their affiliates believe that
additional lawsuits may be filed in federal or state courts naming the
Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, the Subject Funds, the Open-End Funds, the
Fund, the Fund's Trustees and/or their affiliates.

Although it is not possible to predict what, if any, effect the foregoing will
have on the market for the Fund's shares, the Investment Manager and the
Sub-Adviser believe that these matters are not likely to have a material adverse
effect on the operations of the Fund or on the Investment Manager's, or
Sub-Adviser's ability to perform their respective investment advisory services
to the Fund.

Nominating Committee Charter includes "Procedures for Shareholders to Submit
Nominee Candidates," which sets forth the procedures by which shareholders may
recommend nominees to the Registrant's Board of Trustees. The Registrant has
not yet held its first annual shareholders' meeting, so these procedures have

Schedule 14A, and this is the first Form N-CSR filing made by the Registrant
after Item 9 was added to the Form. Among other requirements, the procedures
provide that the recommending shareholder must submit any recommendation in
writing to the Registrant to the attention of the Registrant's Secretary, at
the address of the principal executive offices of the Registrant and that such
submission must be received at such offices not less than 45 days nor more
than 75 days prior to the date of the Board or shareholder meeting at which
the nominee would be elected. Any recommmendation must include certain
biographical and other information regarding the candidate and the
recommending shareholder, and must include a written and signed consent of the
candidate to be named as a nominee and to serve as a Trustee if elected. The
foregoing description of the requirements is only a summary and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to Appendix B of the Nominating Committee Charter.

     Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls

     controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of
     this document.

     in factors that could affect these controls subsequent to the date of their
     evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
