MUNIVEST FUND, INC.

The Benefits and
Risks of
Leveraging

MuniVest Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging to seek to enhance the yield and net
asset value of its Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in
all interest rate environments. To leverage, the Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these investments
is paid to Common Stock shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of
these portfolio holdings is reflected in the per share net asset value of the
Fund's Common Stock. However, in order to benefit Common Stock shareholders, the
yield curve must be positively sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must
be lower than long-term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally
declining interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If either of
these conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will begin to outweigh the
benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of Preferred
Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time, the fund's
total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term interest
rates. Of course, increases in short-term interest rates would reduce (and even
eliminate) the dividends on the Common Stock.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the American Stock Exchange), may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's investments,
since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate. In addition to
the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's Common Stock may
also decline.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Fund may invest in certain securities
whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a floating
interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse floaters will
decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase when short-term
interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be characterized as
derivative securities and may subject the Fund to the risks of reduced or
eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In addition,
inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage and, as a
result, the market value of such securities will generally be more volatile than
that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the Fund invests in
inverse floaters, the market value of the Fund's portfolio and the net asset
value of the Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the Fund did not
invest in such securities.

Swap Agreements

The Fund may also invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter
contracts in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the
change in market value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return
for periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change
in market value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements
may be used to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities.

DEAR SHAREHOLDER

For the six months ended February 28, 2003, the Common Stock of MuniVest Fund,
Inc. had a net annualized yield of 6.42%, based on a period-end per share net
asset value of $9.86 and $.314 per share income dividends. Over the same period,
the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +4.60%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $9.76 to $9.86, and assuming
reinvestment of $.311 per share ordinary income dividends.

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2003, the Fund's Preferred Stock had
an average yield as follows: Series A, 1.16%; Series B, 1.34%; Series C, 1.31%;
Series D, 1.42%; and Series E, 1.23%.

The Municipal Market Environment

During the six-month period ended February 28, 2003, long-term fixed income
interest rates continued to move lower. As they had in 2002, declining U.S.
equity markets and escalating worldwide political tensions easily overshadowed
the incipient U.S. economic recovery, allowing bond yields to fall to recent
historical lows. Economic releases, such as national employment and purchasing
manager surveys, were generally weak early in the period. Additionally, at its
August 2002 meeting, the Federal Reserve Board indicated that concerns about
future economic weakness outweighed those of rising inflation. This signaled
that the Federal Reserve Board was more likely to continue to lower short-term
interest rates to boost economic activity rather than to raise them to reduce
inflationary pressures. These factors combined to generate a very favorable
fixed income environment in September 2002. The dramatic decline in equity
values during September also helped trigger a significant fixed income rally as
investors sought the safe-haven status of U.S. Treasury issues. By the end of
September, U.S. Treasury bond yields fell to 4.65%.

Bolstered by an unexpected decline in the national unemployment rate to 5.6% in
early October, U.S. equity markets staged a strong rally throughout much of the
month. The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) Index rose over 8% for October,
triggered by stronger-than-expected earnings reports from a large number of
companies, such as General Electric Company, International Business Machines
Corporation and Microsoft Corporation. As they have throughout most of the
period, bond prices traded in an inverse relationship to equity prices.
Consequently, as stocks rallied, bond yields rose in October, despite generally
weak economic releases. During October, the U.S. housing sector remained quite
robust, but retail sales and industrial production slowed. Fixed income bond
yields remained under pressure in November as U.S. equity markets continued to
strengthen. During November, the S&P 500 Index rose an additional 5.5%. Equity
prices were supported by further signs of U.S. economic recovery, especially
improving labor market activity. By the end of the third quarter, gross domestic
product growth was 4%, well above the second quarter 2002 rate of 1.3%.
Financial conditions were also strengthened by a larger-than-expected reduction
in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board in early November. The
Federal Funds target rate was lowered 50 basis points (.50%) to 1.25%, its
lowest level since the 1960s. Recent action by the Federal Reserve Board was
largely viewed as being taken to bolster the sputtering U.S. economic recovery.
Rebounding U.S. equity markets and the prospects for a more substantial U.S.
economic recovery pushed long-term U.S. Treasury yield levels to 5.10% by late
November.

However, over the past three months, softer equity prices and renewed investor
concerns about U.S. military action against Iraq and nuclear tensions in North
Korea again pushed bond prices higher. Reacting to disappointing holiday sales
and corporate managements' attempts to scale back analysts' expectation of
future earnings, the S&P 500 Index declined more than 8% during the last three
months. Fearing a U.S./Iraq military confrontation in early 2003, investors
again sought the safety of U.S. Treasury obligations. During February, U.S.
Treasury bond yields declined more than 25 basis points to end the period at
4.67%. Over the last six months, U.S. Treasury bond yields fell more than 25
basis points.

For the six-month period ended February 28, 2003, tax-exempt bond prices also
continued to rise. In recent months, municipal bond yields have declined in
response to the positive fixed income environment engendered by falling equity
valuations. Price advances in tax-exempt issues, however, have not been able to
keep pace with U.S. Treasury bond price improvement as municipal bonds cannot
offer foreign investors the safe-haven status U.S. Treasury obligations enjoy in
periods of economic and political instability. Additionally, tax-exempt bond
issuance increased dramatically in the last half of 2002, removing some of the
positive technical support the municipal bond market enjoyed earlier in the
year. At February 28, 2003, long-term municipal bond yields, as measured by the
Bond Buyer Revenue Bond Index, stood at 5.10%, a decline of approximately 15
basis points during the last six months.

A number of factors combined to generate consistently strong demand for
municipal bonds throughout the six-month period ended February 28, 2003.
Declining U.S. equity markets supported continued positive demand for tax-exempt
products as investors sought the relative security of fixed income issues. Also,
with tax-exempt money market rates near 1%, the demand for longer maturity
municipal issues has increased as investors have opted to buy longer maturity
issues rather than remain in cash reserves. Additionally, investors renewed
approximately $30 billion in January 2003 from bond maturities, coupon income
and proceeds from early redemptions. However, these positive demand factors have
not been totally able to offset the increase in tax-exempt new-issue supply that
has resulted in the underperformance seen in recent months. This price
underperformance served to make municipal bonds a particularly attractive
purchase relative to their taxable counterparts. Throughout most of the yield
curve, municipal bonds have been available for purchase at yields near or
exceeding those of comparable U.S. Treasury issues. Compared to their recent
historical averages of 82% - 88% of U.S. Treasury yields, municipal bond yield
ratios in their current 95% - 105% range are likely to prove attractive to
long-term investors.

Declining U.S. equity markets and escalating geopolitical pressures have
resulted in reduced economic activity and consumer confidence. Consequently,
fixed income bond yields have continued to decline to recent historic lows and
to levels that may not be supported by economic fundamentals alone. It is
important to note that, despite all the negative factors impeding the growth of
U.S. businesses, the U.S. economy still grew at an approximate 2.5% rate for all
of 2002, twice that of 2001. Similar expansion is expected in early 2003.
However, until both Iraqi and North Korean conflicts are resolved, any
meaningful increase in interest rates is unlikely.

Some analysts expect that, upon resolution of these conflicts, U.S. business
conditions will quickly improve. Bond yields, especially U.S. Treasury
securities, which have enjoyed a significant safe-haven benefit, are also
expected to quickly rise. However, it is questionable to expect that even a
quick, positive closure to these hostilities would restore business and investor
confidence to the extent that U.S. economic growth would dramatically explode
and foster associated, large-scale interest rate increases. The resumption of
solid economic growth is likely to be a gradual process accompanied by equally
graduated increases in bond yields. Moderate economic growth, within the content
of negligible inflationary pressures, should not greatly endanger the positive
fixed income environment tax-exempt products are currently experiencing.

Portfolio Strategy

For the six months ended February 28, 2003, we maintained the Fund's neutral
market stance through the early part of February. We recently adopted a more
defensive position in response to historic low interest rate levels that are
similar to those reached in late 1993 and 1998. We do not anticipate a dramatic,
significant increase in bond yields in 2003. Given the sharp reversal in asset
valuation in the years following such low levels, however, we believed it
prudent to begin to preserve recent asset appreciation. We will continue to
monitor economic and political conditions in anticipation of stronger U.S.
business activity since we believe that stronger, persistent economic activity
would require an increasingly defensive stance.

We also continued to increase the Fund's income stream by adding lower-rated,
investment grade issues. The Fund maintained its high credit

quality profile throughout the period. At the end of February 2003, 36.9% of the
Fund's assets were rated AAA and 62.1% of the assets were rated AA or better by
at least one of the major bond rating agencies. The recent addition of
higher-yielding issues has helped to raise the Fund's income stream to the
extent that we were able to increase the Fund's dividend payout twice in 2002
and once thus far in 2003.

During the period, the Fund's borrowing costs remained in the 1% - 1.5% range,
with interest rates presently below 1%. These very attractive funding levels, in
combination with the steep tax-exempt yield curve, generated a significant
income benefit to the Fund's Common Stock shareholders from the leveraging of
the Preferred Stock. We do not anticipate any material reduction in the Fund's
borrowing costs in 2003 as additional monetary policy easing by the Federal
Reserve Board is not expected. We anticipate the Fund's short-term borrowing
costs to remain in the 1% - 1.5% range for most of the year. However, should the
spread between short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of
leverage will decline and, as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common
Stock. (For a more complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging,
see page 1 of this report to shareholders.)

In Conclusion

We appreciate your ongoing interest in MuniVest Fund, Inc., and we look forward
to assisting you with your financial needs in the months and years ahead.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

MuniVest Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The
Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which may require
the use of management accruals and estimates. These unaudited financial
statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management,
necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim period presented.
All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Fund determines and
makes available for publication the net asset value of its Common Stock on a
weekly basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on the American Stock Exchange
under the symbol MVF. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments -- Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter markets and are valued at the most recent bid price or yield
equivalent as obtained by the Fund's pricing service from dealers that make
markets in such securities. Financial futures contracts and options thereon,
which are traded on exchanges, are valued at their closing prices as of the
close of such exchanges. Options written or purchased are valued at the last
sale price in the case of exchange-traded options. In the case of options traded
in the over-the-counter market, valuation is the last asked price (options
written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Securities with remaining
maturities of sixty days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value. Securities and assets for which market quotations are
not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or
under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund, including valuations
furnished by a pricing service retained by the Fund, which may utilize a matrix
system for valuations. The procedures of the pricing service and its valuations
are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general supervision of the
Board of Directors.

(b) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies to increase or decrease the level of risk to which the
Fund is exposed more quickly and efficiently than transactions in other types of
instruments. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if
the counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial futures
contracts and options on such futures contracts for the purpose of hedging the
market risk on existing securities or the intended purchase of securities.
Futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific
future date and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the
Fund deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by the
exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the
Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the
daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses.
When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and
the value at the time it was closed.

o Options -- The Fund is authorized to write covered call options and purchase
put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium
received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The
amount of the liability is subsequently marked to market to reflect the current
market value of the option written.

When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an option, the
related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from) the basis of
the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds of the
security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a closing
transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the extent of
the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the cost of the
closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o Forward interest rate swaps -- The Fund is authorized to enter into forward
interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging the interest rate risk on
portfolio securities. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the
counterparty agree to pay or receive interest on a specified notional contract
amount, commencing on a specified future effective date, unless terminated
earlier. The value of the agreement is determined by quoted fair values received
daily by the Fund from the counterparty. When the agreement is closed, the Fund
records a realized gain or loss in an amount equal to the value of the
agreement.

(c) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no Federal income tax provision is required.

(d) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

MANAGED DIVIDEND POLICY

The Fund's dividend policy is to distribute all or a portion of its net
investment income to its shareholders on a monthly basis. In order to provide
shareholders with a more consistent yield to the current trading price of shares
of Common Stock of the Fund, the Fund may at times pay out less than the entire
amount of net investment income earned in any particular month and may at times
in any particular month pay out such accumulated but undistributed income in
addition to net investment income earned in that month. As a result, the
dividends paid by the Fund for any particular month may be more or less than the
amount of net investment income earned by the Fund during such month. The Fund's
current accumulated but undistributed net investment income, if any, is
disclosed in the Statement of Net Assets, which comprises part of the financial
information included in this report.

MuniVest Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders with as high a level of
current income exempt from Federal income taxes as is consistent with its
investment policies and prudent investment management by investing primarily in
a portfolio of long-term, investment-grade municipal obligations, the interest
on which is exempt from Federal income taxes in the opinion of bond counsel to
the issuer.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to the
shareholders of MuniVest Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus, circular or representation intended for use in the purchase of
shares of the Fund or any securities mentioned in the report. Past performance
results shown in this report should not be considered a representation of future
performance. The Fund has leveraged its Common Stock and intends to remain
leveraged by issuing Preferred Stock to provide the Common Stock shareholders
with a potentially higher rate of return. Leverage creates risks for Common
Stock shareholders, including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset
value and market price of shares of the Common Stock, and the risk that
fluctuations in the short-term dividend rates of the Preferred Stock may affect
the yield to Common Stock shareholders. Statements and other information herein
are as dated and are subject to change.
