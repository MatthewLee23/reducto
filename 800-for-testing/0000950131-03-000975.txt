ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

        The Annual Report to Stockholders follows.

<PAGE>

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

Performance Review--Your Fund had a total return (market price change plus
income) of 1.4% for the fourth quarter, resulting in a -3.0% total return for
calendar year 2002. In comparison, the S&P Utilities Index had a total return
of 4.9% for the quarter and -29.9% for the year. A composite of the S&P
Utilities Index and the Lehman Utility Bond Index, reflecting the stock and
bond ratio of the Fund, had a total return of 3.8% for the quarter and -21.9%
for the year.

For a broader perspective on the 2002 relative performance of the Utility
Indexes cited above, the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
total returns for the year of -15.0% and -22.1%, respectively. As an
alternative comparison, Lipper Analytical Services calculations show the
following equity sector mutual fund total returns for the year: Utility -23.8%,
Telecommunications -41.3%, Equity Income -16.3%, and Large-Capitalization Value
- -20.0%.

During the fourth quarter of 2002, your Fund paid three monthly 6.5 cent
dividends. The 6.5 cent per share monthly rate, without compounding, would be
78 cents annualized, or a 7.88% common stock dividend yield based on the
December 31, 2002 closing price of $9.90 per share. That yield compares
favorably with the quarter-end yields of 5.18% on the Dow Jones Utility Index
and 5.05% on the S&P Utilities Index.

Feeling for the Bottom--Calendar year 2002 marked the third consecutive year of
broad equity market declines--an event that has not occurred since the period
from 1939 to 1941. Although a fourth year of negative equity returns is
statistically unlikely, we feel it is more appropriate to base investment
expectations on fundamental considerations.

During the latter half of 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001, the U.S.
economy was weakening. Many companies were responding to significant
overcapacity in an environment of declining demand for capital goods and high
inventories. Businesses acted to cut production, employment declined, consumer
and investor sentiment fell, and equity prices remained under pressure. The
domestic economic environment was exacerbated by weakness in economies globally
and the U.S. entered a recession in 2001.

In response, the Federal Reserve embarked on a series of interest rate
reductions that took the federal funds rate from 6.50% at the end of 2000 to
1.25% at the end of 2002. Cutting short-term interest rates lowers borrowing
costs, which encourages households to purchase autos, homes, and furnishings.
Typically in turn, inventories are drawn down and businesses add employees and
equipment to meet the rising demand. The stock market usually anticipates the
increase in business activity and share prices rise.

Data indicate that an economic recovery began during 2002, albeit at an uneven
pace and with certain sectors still very depressed. Although consumer spending
remains resilient, business spending is depressed, unemployment stubbornly
high, and the stock market undecided. The current economic malaise and the
potential for geopolitical uncertainties to depress near-term economic activity
will likely keep the Federal Reserve in an accommodative posture for the bulk
of the year. However, we believe that the Federal Reserve's current monetary
policy will eventually result in stronger economic growth and higher stock
prices in the future.

Both the telecommunications and electric and gas industries have experienced a
"recession" of their own over the past two years. While intertwined with
general economic conditions, industry-specific issues have hurt the performance
of these two sectors. In the telecom sector, the late 1990s were a time of boom
spending for the

<PAGE>

deployment of fiber optic capacity. The investment markets were willing to
provide capital for anticipated growth in Internet demand and unproven business
plans. Simultaneously, regulation mandated a competitive environment for a
broad range of communication services, enhancing choice to the consumer but
cutting corporate profit margins to the bone. Many competitive local carriers
failed, and the accounting irregularities and eventual Chapter 11 filing of
long distance carrier and internet backbone provider WorldCom Inc. further
slashed sector valuations.

In the power sector, valuations have been hurt by the increased business risk
of debt-financed corporate investments outside the traditional regulated
utility businesses. These investments generally focused on power generation and
energy trading and marketing for the wholesale market. The diversification
strategies were designed to enhance shareholder value in an increasingly
competitive market, but by and large failed miserably. As in the
telecommunications sector, the power industry had a notable bankruptcy--Enron
Corp.

With both telecommunications and power industries experiencing problems, credit
rating agencies and investors wearied of unfulfilled strategic promises. Weak
operating performance led to a precipitous decline in aggregate credit quality
and ratings, and limitations on availability of capital to fund industry needs.
Access to capital, if available at all, became more and more expensive and
liquidity concerns and legal investigations culminated in full-blown liquidity
and credit rating crises.

These crises have taught companies valuable lessons. For the power group, that
means unwinding trading and marketing operations and returning to their core
competencies of the generation and distribution of power. For the
communications group that means cost management and capital expenditure
reductions, possible asset sales, and improved balance sheets. We believe that
although companies still need to resolve many issues, performance in these
sectors and the market's view of these sectors should improve valuations in the
future.

A more thorough analysis of industry trends and outlooks will appear in our
next quarterly letter based on Fund analysts' annual presentation to the Board
of Directors.

President Bush's Dividend Tax Proposal--Early in January President Bush
proposed a "growth and jobs plan" that would cut taxes in order to stimulate
economic growth. The largest component of the plan proposes the elimination of
the double taxation of dividends. Under current tax law, corporations pay
dividends from after-tax income and individuals pay income tax on dividends
received. The proposed plan would permit shareholders to exclude dividend
income from taxable income, and would provide an increase in the tax basis of
shares of stock for taxable income retained by a corporation.

An important theme in the President's rationale for this proposal is the belief
that if tax rates on dividends were lower, corporations would be likely to pay
them more generously, and investors would find stocks more attractive.
Increased funding would then flow to corporations through the stock market, and
the resulting availability of capital would encourage investment and growth.
Economic growth in turn, typically increases employment and raises the standard
of living for the average American.

The President's proposal must still navigate the political process and, if
passed by Congress, would almost certainly be in a negotiated and compromised
form. We would point out, however, that the current proposal would permit
mutual funds to pass through qualifying dividends tax-free to their
shareholders, and that the proposal does not alter your Fund's primary
objective of current income.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
DNP Select Income Fund Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of DNP Select Income Fund Inc.
(a Maryland corporation) (formerly Duff & Phelps Utilities Income Inc.),
including the schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2002, and the related
statements of operations, changes in net assets, cash flows and the financial
highlights for the year then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audit. The statement of changes in net assets and the financial
highlights of DNP Select Income Fund Inc., as of December 31, 2001, and for the
four years in the period then ended, were audited by other auditors who have
ceased operations. Those auditors expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements in their report dated February 5, 2002.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and
financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2002, by correspondence
with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate audit procedures where
replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 2002 financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
DNP Select Income Fund Inc. at December 31, 2002, the results of its
operations, its cash flows, the changes in its net assets and the financial
highlights for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               December 31, 2002

(1) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

   DNP Select Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund", formerly Duff & Phelps Utilities
Income Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on
November 26, 1986. The Fund commenced operations on January 21, 1987, as a
closed-end diversified management investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The primary investment objectives of the Fund
are current income and long-term growth of income. Capital appreciation is a
secondary objective.

   The following are the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

      (a) The market values for securities are determined as follows: Equity
   securities traded on a national securities exchange or traded
   over-the-counter and quoted on the NASDAQ System are valued at last sales
   prices. Fixed income securities and any other securities for which it is
   determined that market prices are unavailable or inappropriate are valued at
   a fair value using a procedure determined in good faith by the Board of
   Directors which includes the use of a pricing service. Each money market
   instrument having a maturity of 60 days or less is valued on an amortized
   cost basis, which approximates market value.

      (b) No provision is made for Federal income taxes since the Fund has
   elected to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" and has made such
   distributions to its shareholders deemed necessary to be relieved of all
   Federal income taxes under provisions of current Federal tax law. The Fund
   intends to utilize provisions of Federal income tax laws which allow a
   realized capital loss to be carried forward for eight years following the
   year of loss and offset such losses against any future realized gains. At
   December 31, 2002, the Fund had tax capital loss carry forwards of
   $199,205,932 which expire beginning on December 31, 2003. For the period
   November 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002 the Fund incurred net realized
   capital losses of $181,983,140. The Fund intends to treat these losses as
   having occurred on January 1, 2003.

      At December 31, 2002, on a tax basis, the Fund had undistributed net
   investment income of $2,103,117; and based on a $2,792,953,260 tax cost of
   investments, gross unrealized appreciation of $139,857,445 and unrealized
   depreciation of $126,699,675. The difference between the book basis and tax
   basis of distributable earnings are primarily a result of tax deferral of
   wash sale losses, the accretion of discount and amortization of premiums.

      (c) The accounts of the Fund are kept on the accrual basis of accounting.
   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or
   losses from sales of securities are determined on the specific identified
   cost basis. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Interest
   income and expense are recognized on the accrual basis. Discounts and
   premiums on securities are amortized over the lives of the respective
   securities for book purposes. Discounts and premiums are not amortized for
   tax purposes.

      (d) The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
   principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
   make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
   and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
   date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
   decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual
   results could differ from those estimates.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
                               December 31, 2002


      (e) As required, effective January 1, 2002, the Fund has adopted the
   classification requirement of EITF D-98, Classification and Measurement of
   Redeemable Securities. EITF D-98 requires that preferred stock be presented
   separately at liquidation preference on the balance sheet. Accordingly,
   certain reclassifications have been made to the statement of operations,
   statements of changes in net assets and financial highlights for all periods
   presented. The adoption of EITF D-98 had no impact on the net asset value of
   the common stock of the Fund.

(2) MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS:

   The Fund has engaged Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co. (the "Adviser")
to provide professional investment management services for the Fund and has
engaged J. J. B. Hilliard, W. L. Lyons, Inc. (the "Administrator") to provide
administrative and management services for the Fund. The Adviser receives a
quarterly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the average weekly net assets of the
Fund up to $1.5 billion and .50% of average weekly net assets in excess
thereof. The Administrator receives a quarterly fee at annual rates of .25% of
average weekly net assets up to $100 million, .20% of average weekly net assets
from $100 million to $1 billion, and .10% of average weekly net assets over $1
billion. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, "average weekly net
assets" is defined as the sum of (i) the aggregate net asset value of the
Fund's common stock (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of the Fund's
preferred stock and (iii) the aggregate proceeds to the Fund of commercial
paper issued by the Fund. Directors of the Fund not affiliated with the Adviser
receive a fee of $25,000 per year plus $2,000 per board meeting, plus $1,500
per committee meeting attended. Committee Chairmen receive an additional fee of
$5,000 per year. Transfer agent and custodian fees are paid to The Bank of New
York.

(3) DIVIDENDS:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the following distributions to common
stockholders from investment income in 2002:

(4) CAPITAL STOCK TRANSACTIONS:

   The Fund may purchase shares of its own stock in open market or private
transactions, from time to time and in such amounts and at such prices (not
exceeding $100,000 plus accumulated and unpaid dividends in the case of the
Fund's remarketed preferred stock and less than net asset value in the case of
the Fund's common stock) as management may deem advisable. Since any such
purchases of the Fund's common stock would be made at prices below net asset
value, they would increase the net asset value per share of the remaining
shares of common stock outstanding. The Fund has not purchased any shares of
its common stock.

   Transactions in common stock and paid-in surplus during 2002 and 2001 were
as follows:

(5) REMARKETED PREFERRED STOCK:

   In 1988, the Fund issued 5,000 shares of Remarketed Preferred Stock ("RP")
in five series of 1,000 shares each at a public offering price of $100,000 per
share. The underwriting discount and other expenses incurred in connection with
the issuance of the RP were recorded as a reduction of paid-in surplus on
common stock. Dividends on the RP are cumulative at a rate which was initially
established for each series at its offering. Since the initial offering of each
series, the dividend rate on each series has been reset every 49 days by a
remarketing process. Dividend rates ranged from 1.389% to 1.950% during the
year ended December 31, 2002.

   The RP is redeemable at the option of the Fund on any dividend payment date
at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends. The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverage with respect
to the RP, and the RP is subject to mandatory redemption if that asset coverage
is not maintained. Each series of RP is also subject to mandatory redemption on
a date certain as follows: Series A--November 28, 2012; Series B--November 18,
2015; Series C--November 7, 2018; Series D--December 22, 2021; and Series
E--December 11, 2024.

   In general, the holders of the RP and of the Common Stock have equal voting
rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the RP, as a class,
vote to elect two members of the Board of Directors, and separate class votes
are required on certain matters that affect the respective interests of the RP
and the Common Stock. The RP has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share
plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

The Notes are unsecured, general obligations of the Fund. The Fund has entered
into a credit agreement to provide liquidity. The Fund is able to request loans

securities. Security loans are subject to the risk of failure by the borrower
to return the loaned securities in which case the Fund could incur a loss. At
