Annual Report

This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
World Dollar Government Fund II (the "Fund") for the annual reporting period
ended March 31, 2004.

Investment Objective and Policies

This closed-end fund is designed for investors who seek high current income
and, secondarily, capital appreciation. To achieve this objective, it invests
primarily in high yielding, high risk sovereign debt and U.S. corporate
fixed-income obligations that we expect to benefit from improving economic and
credit fundamentals.

Investment Results

The following table shows the Fund's performance over the six- and 12-month
periods ended March 31, 2004. For comparison, we have included the J.P. Morgan
Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+), which is a standard measure of
the performance of a basket of unmanaged emerging market debt securities.

Financial Highlights, please see page 25.

*  The Fund's investment results are for the periods shown and are based on the
net asset value (NAV) of the Fund as of March 31, 2004. Performance assumes
reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. All fees and
expenses related to the operation of the Fund have been deducted. Past
performance is no guarantee of future results.

The unmanaged J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+) does not
reflect fees and expenses associated with the active management of a mutual
fund portfolio. The Index is comprised of dollar-denominated restructured
sovereign bonds; a large percentage of the Index is made up of Brady bonds.
Investors cannot invest directly in an index, and its results are not
indicative of any specific investment, including Alliance World Dollar
Government Fund II.

The Fund outperformed its benchmark, the JPM EMBI+, for both the six- and
12-month periods ended March 31, 2004. The Fund benefited primarily from its
emerging market debt country weightings and individual security selection.

The Fund's security selection in Mexican government bonds, followed by holdings
in Brazil, Venezuela and Turkey were the primary contributors to positive
performance. The top performing country within the JPM EMBI+, Ecuador, also
contributed to the Fund's outperformance for the


_______________________________________________________________________________

<PAGE>


12-month period under review. During this annual period, Ecuador returned
73.34%, as measured by the Index. The positioning of Uruguayan and Venezuelan
debt also helped the Fund to outperform versus the Index, as both countries
conducted debt exchanges during this period that significantly improved the
maturity structure of their external debt. Uruguay is not part of the JPM EMBI+.

Market Review and Investment Strategy

The emerging market debt class, as represented by the JPM EMBI+, returned a
strong 23.64% for the annual period ended March 31, 2004. The emerging debt
markets benefited as a result of a very favorable world financial environment
in which the average central bank policy rate declined 100 basis points to just
2.65%. Additionally, limited supply, strong investor demand and global
liquidity levels all remained supportive for this asset class. For the annual
period under review, Latin countries outperformed non-Latin countries, posting
returns of 27.17% versus 18.91%, respectively. All countries represented within
the Index posted positive returns for the reporting period. Top performing
countries included Ecuador at 73.34%, Turkey at 51.78%, Venezuela at 48.80% and
Brazil at 38.94%.

Early in the reporting period, we increased the Fund's overweight exposure to
Brazilian sovereign bonds as President Lula exceeded expectations in his
ability to push forward reforms. However, at the beginning of 2004, we reduced
the Fund's holdings due to concerns over fundamentals, inflation worries and
the possible inability of Brazil's Central Bank to continue reducing interest
rates. In addition, political scandal and subsequent missteps have caused the
Lula administration to lose much of  the political goodwill it had in 2003.

We decreased the Fund's holdings in Mexico as a result of stalled growth, which
was due to poor external demand, mainly from the U.S., and loss of
competitiveness in Mexico's manufacturing sector.

We have maintained the Fund's position in Russian sovereign debt as credit
statistics continued to improve. Russia, which was recently upgraded by
Standard & Poor's (S&P) to BB+ and is rated Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service,
has strong gross domestic product momentum and little need to issue new debt.
The country is also benefiting from high oil prices and President Putin's
appointment of a pro-reform government. Russia comprises approximately 20% of
the JPM EMBI+.

Early in the reporting period, we increased the Fund's holdings in Uruguay as
the government announced an aggressive plan to swap its outstanding debt (with
the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)) for longer maturity
securities. This strategy contributed positively to the Fund's performance.

We also increased the Fund's holdings in Ecuador, which benefited from


_______________________________________________________________________________

2 o ALLIANCE WORLD DOLLAR GOVERNMENT FUND II
<PAGE>


higher oil prices and greater output, significant structural reforms and
engagement with the IMF.

S&P raised Turkey's rating to B+ from B during the reporting period, crediting
the government's efforts to comply with targets set by the IMF and its resolve
to implement reforms. At that time, we added to the Fund's position in Turkey.

Finally, we have reduced the Fund's leverage and scaled back the interest rate
duration of the Fund due to the prospect of tighter monetary policy in the U.S.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2004

NOTE A

Significant Accounting Policies

Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II (the "Fund") was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Maryland on May 20, 1993 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which
require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and
amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation

In accordance with Pricing Policies adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Fund (the "Pricing Policies") and applicable law, portfolio securities are
valued at current market value or at fair value. The Board of Directors has
delegated to Alliance Capital Management L.P. (the "Adviser"), subject to the
Board's continuing oversight, certain responsibilities with respect to the
implementation of the Pricing Policies. Pursuant to the Pricing Policies,
securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at
their current market value. In general, the market value of these securities is
determined as follows:

Securities listed on a national securities exchange or on a foreign securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price at the close of the exchange or
foreign securities exchange. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such
day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day, then the security is
valued in good faith at fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies.
Securities listed on more than one exchange are valued by reference to the
principal exchange on which the securities are traded; securities not listed on
an exchange but traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued
in accordance with the NASDAQ Official Closing Price; listed put or call
options are valued at the last sale price. If there has been no sale on that
day, such securities will be valued at the closing bid prices on that day; open
futures contracts and options thereon are valued using the closing settlement
price or, in the absence of such a price, the most recent quoted bid price. If
there are no quotations available for the day of valuations, the last available
closing settlement price is used; securities traded in the over-the-counter
market, (but excluding securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of
the current bid and asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau
or other comparable sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt
instruments having 60 days or less remaining until maturity are valued at
amortized cost if their original maturity was 60 days or less, or by amortizing
their fair value as of the 61st day prior to maturity if their original term to
maturity exceeded 60 days; fixed-income securities, including

                                                  Notes to Financial Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


mortgage backed and asset backed securities, may be valued on the basis of
prices provided by a pricing service or at a price obtained from one or more of
the major broker/dealers. In cases where broker/dealer quotes are obtained, the
Pricing Policies provide that the Adviser may establish procedures whereby
changes in market yields or spreads are used to adjust, on a daily basis, a
recently obtained quoted price on a security; and OTC and other derivatives are
valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or spread from a major broker/dealer
in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at
fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies. The Fund fair values a
security that it holds when a significant event (e.g., an earthquake or a major
terrorist attack) occurs after the time that the latest market quotation was
established, and, as a result, such market quotation cannot be said to
represent the current market value of the security as of the time the Fund
prices its shares. Fair valuing securities is imprecise, and there is no
assurance that the Fund could dispose of the security at the price used for
determining the Fund's net asset value.

2. Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions

Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the date securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and losses are
determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund accretes discounts as
adjustments to interest income. Additionally, the Fund amortizes premiums on
debt securities for financial statement reporting purposes.

4. Dividends and Distributions

Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. Income and capital gains distributions are determined in accordance with
federal tax regulations and may differ from those determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. To the extent
these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified within the
capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require such reclassification.

NOTE B

Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets. Such fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser an
administrative fee at an annual rate of .15 of 1% of the Fund's average weekly
net assets. Such fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. The Adviser provides
administrative functions as well as other clerical services to the Fund and
prepares financial and regulatory reports.

The Fund entered into a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance
Global Investor Services, Inc. ("AGIS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Adviser, whereby the Fund reimburses AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone
inquiries on behalf of the Fund. During the year ended March 31, 2004, there
was no reimbursement paid to AGIS.

NOTE C

Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the year ended March 31, 2004, were as follows:

                                                 Purchases           Sales

1. Option Transactions

For hedging and investment purposes, the Fund may purchase and write (sell) put
and call options on U.S. and foreign government securities and foreign
currencies that are traded on U.S. and foreign securities exchanges and
over-the-counter markets.

The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium
whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund bears the risk
of loss of premium and change in market value should the counterparty not
perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for in
the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities acquired
through the exercise of call options is increased by premiums paid. The
proceeds from securities sold through the exercise of put options are decreased
by the premiums paid.

                                                  Notes to Financial Statements
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


When the Fund writes an option, the premium received by the Fund is recorded as
a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of the
option written. Premiums received from written options which expire unexercised
are recorded by the Fund on the expiration date as realized gains from options
written. The difference between the premium received and the amount paid on
effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is
also treated as a realized gain, or if the premium received is less than the
amount paid for the closing purchase transaction, as a realized loss. If a call
option is exercised, the premium received is added to the proceeds from the
sale of the underlying security or currency in determining whether the Fund has
realized a gain or loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium received
reduces the cost basis of the security or currency purchased by the Fund. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security or currency underlying the written option. Exercise
of an option written by the Fund could result in the Fund selling or buying a
security or currency at a price different from the current market value.

Transactions in written options for the year ended March 31, 2004, were as
follows:

                                                   Number of        Premiums

2. Swap Agreements

The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and
credit risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates
two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based
upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a
specified amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted
against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment
to be received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the
contract. Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each
counterparty to a swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk.
Additionally, risks may arise from unanticipated movements in interest rates or
in the value of the underlying securities.

The Fund accrues for the interim payments on swap contracts on a daily basis,
with the net amount recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


swap contracts on the statement of assets and liabilities. Once the interim
payments are settled in cash, the net amount is recorded as realized gain/loss
on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss recorded upon the termination of
swap contracts on the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the value of
swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation/ depreciation of investments.

The Fund may enter into credit default swaps. The Fund may purchase credit
protection on the referenced obligation of the credit default swap ("Buy
Contract") or provide credit protection on the referenced obligation of the
credit default swap ("Sale Contract"). A sale/(buy) in a credit default swap
provides upon the occurrence of a credit event, as defined in the swap
agreement, for the Fund to buy/(sell) from/(to) the counterparty at the
notional amount (the "Notional Amount") and receive/(deliver) the principal
amount of the referenced obligation. If a credit event occurs, the maximum
payout amount for a Sale Contract is limited to the Notional Amount of the swap
contract ("Maximum Payout Amount"). During the term of the swap agreement, the
Fund receives/(pays) semi-annual fixed payments from/(to) the respective
counterparty, calculated at the agreed upon interest rate applied to the
Notional Amount. These interim payments are recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts on the statement of assets and
liabilities.

Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if a Fund had invested in
the referenced obligation directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general
market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the Fund is
a buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its investment. In addition,
if the Fund is a seller and a credit event occurs, the value of the referenced
obligation received by the Fund coupled with the periodic payments previously
received, may be less than the Maximum Payout Amount it pays to the buyer,
resulting in a loss to the Fund.

At March 31, 2004, the Fund had Sale Contracts outstanding with Maximum Payout
Amounts aggregating $76,825,000, with net unrealized appreciation of $5,713,395
and terms ranging from 10 months to 9 years, as reflected in the portfolio of
investments.

In certain circumstances, the Fund may hold Sale Contracts on the same
referenced obligation and with the same counterparty it has purchased credit
protection, which may reduce its obligation to make payments on Sale Contracts,
if a credit event occurs. The Fund had Buy Contracts outstanding with a
Notional Amount of $21,100,000 with respect to the same referenced obligations
and same counterparties of certain Sale Contracts outstanding, which reduced
its obligation to make payments on Sale Contracts to $55,725,000 as of March
31, 2004.

3. Reverse Repurchase Agreements

Under a reverse repurchase agreement, the Fund sells securities and agrees to
repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon date and price. At the time the Fund

enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it will establish a segregated
account with the custodian containing liquid assets having a value at least
equal to the repurchase price.

For the year ended March 31, 2004, the average amount of reverse repurchase
agreements outstanding was $63,069,505 and the daily weighted average interest
rate was .85%.

NOTE D

Capital Stock

There are 100,000,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock authorized. Of the
67,648,715 shares outstanding at March 31, 2004, the Adviser owned 7,200
shares. During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Fund repurchased 10,201,653
shares of its outstanding common stock for $13.02 per share pursuant to a
tender offer. The Fund incurred tender offering costs of $66,049 which were
charged to additional paid-in capital. During the years ended March 31, 2004
and March 31, 2003, the Fund issued no shares in connection with the Fund's
dividend reinvestment plan.

NOTE E

Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

Concentration of Risk--Investing in securities of foreign companies or foreign
governments involves special risks which include changes in foreign exchange
rates and the possibility of future political and economic developments which
could adversely affect the value of such securities. Moreover, securities of
many foreign companies or foreign governments and their markets may be less
liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable United States
companies or of the United States government.

In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that contain
a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects the risk of loss
thereunder to be remote.

Distributions to Shareholders

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended March 31,
2004 and March 31, 2003 were as follows:

                                                   2004             2003
                                              =============    =============
Distributions paid from:
  Ordinary income                             $  87,373,144    $  82,323,739

Total taxable distributions                      87,373,144       82,323,739
                                              -------------    -------------
Total distributions paid                      $  87,373,144    $  82,323,739
                                              =============    =============


As of March 31, 2004, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit) on a tax
basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income                                  $   2,695,800
Accumulated capital and other losses                            (127,414,167)(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                           133,560,278(b)
                                                               -------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)                           $   8,841,911
                                                               =============


(a)  On March 31, 2004, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
$127,414,167 of which $68,891,646 expires in the year 2010 and $58,522,521
expires in the year 2011. To the extent future capital gains are offset by
capital loss carryforwards, such gains will not be distributed. During the
fiscal year, the fund utilized capital loss carryforwards of $225,624,007.

(b)  The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of
losses on wash sales, the difference between book and tax amortization methods
for premium and the difference between book  and tax treatment of swap income.

During the current fiscal year, permanent differences, primarily due to the tax
treatment of bond premium and the tax treatment of swap income, resulted in a
net decrease in distributions in excess of net investment income and an
increase in accumulated net realized loss on investment transactions. This
reclassification had no effect on net assets.

Legal Proceedings

As has been previously reported in the press, the Staff of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General
("NYAG") have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry
identified as "market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain
other regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into
these practices within the industry and have requested that Alliance Capital
Management L.P. ("Alliance Capital"), the Fund's Adviser, provide information
to them. Alliance Capital has been cooperating and will continue to cooperate
with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the
Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by the market.
Accordingly, the

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the market timing and late trading
practices that are the subject of the investigations mentioned above or the
lawsuits described below. Please see below for a description of the agreements
reached by Alliance Capital and the SEC and NYAG in connection with the
investigations mentioned above.

In addition, numerous lawsuits have been filed against Alliance Capital and
certain other defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on
or related to the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG
investigations referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a
party. Management of the Fund's Adviser believes that these private lawsuits
are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations
or financial condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, Alliance Capital confirmed that it had reached terms with
the SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is subject to final,
definitive documentation. Among the key provisions of these agreements are the
following:

(i)  Alliance Capital agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the
"Reimbursement Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse
effects of market timing attributable to market timing relationships described
in the SEC Order. According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be
paid, in order of priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share
of losses suffered by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate
share of advisory fees paid by such fund during the period of such market
timing;

(ii)  Alliance Capital agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some
of the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing January
1, 2004, for a period of at least five years; and

(iii)  Alliance Capital agreed to implement changes to its governance and
compliance procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that Alliance
Capital's registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will
introduce governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

                                                           Financial Highlights
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(a)  As of April 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected within
net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however prior to
April 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense on the statement of operations. The effect of this change for
the year ended March 31, 2004, was to decrease net investment income per share
by $0.06 and increase net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment
transactions per share by $0.06, and decrease the ratios of net investment
income and expenses to average net assets by 0.50% and 0.20%, respectively.

(b)  As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund has adopted the provisions
of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies, and
began amortizing premium on debt securities for financial statement reporting
purposes only. The effect of this change for the year ended March 31, 2002 was
to decrease net investment income per share by $.01, increase net realized and
unrealized gain on investments per share by $.01, and decrease the ratio of net
investment income to average net assets from 12.74% to 12.69%. Per share,
ratios and supplemental data for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been
restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(c)  Based on average shares outstanding.

(d)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed, for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to
the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of
such periods. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one
year is not annualized.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Alliance World Dollar Government
Fund II,Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II, Inc., including the portfolio of
investments, as of March 31, 2004, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial
highlights. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of
March 31, 2004, by correspondence with the custodian and others. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II, Inc. at March 31, 2004, the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in
its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(unaudited)

Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names may elect to be
participants in the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
pursuant to which dividends and capital gain distributions to shareholders will
be paid in or reinvested in additional shares of the Fund. State Street Bank
and Trust Company (the "Agent") will act as agent for participants under the
Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee
should contact such broker or nominee to determine whether or how they may
participate in the Plan.

If the Board declares an income distribution or determines to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares or in cash, as holders of the Common
Stock may have elected, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and
participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock
of the Fund valued as follows:

(i)  If the shares of Common Stock are trading at net asset value or at a
premium above net asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new
shares at the greater of net asset value or 95% of the then current market
price.

(ii)  If the shares of Common Stock are trading at a discount from net asset
value at the time of valuation, the Agent will receive the dividend or
distribution in cash and apply it to the purchase of the Fund's shares of
Common Stock in the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. Such purchases will be made on or shortly after
the payment date for such dividend or distribution and in no event more than 30
days after such date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
purchase is necessary to comply with Federal securities laws. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset value
of a share of Common Stock, the average purchase price per share paid by the
Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares of Common Stock,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or
distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Fund.

The Agent will maintain all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnish
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Agent in non-certificate form in the name of
the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan.

There will be no charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund to
satisfy the dividend reinvestment requirements. However, each participant will
pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Agent's open market purchases of shares. In each case, the cost per share of
shares purchased for each shareholder's account will be the average cost,
including brokerage commissions, of any shares purchased in the

open market plus the cost of any shares issued by the Fund.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income taxes that may be payable (or required to be
withheld) on dividends and distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent
to written notice of the change sent to participants in the Plan at least 90
days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan may
also be amended or terminated by the Agent on at least 90 days' written notice
to participants in the Plan. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Agent at State Street Bank and Trust Company, P.O. Box 366,
Boston, Massachusetts 02101.

Since the filing of the most recent amendment to the Fund's registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there have been (i) no
material changes in the Fund's investment objectives or policies, except that
50% of the Fund's required investments in sovereign debt obligations is no
longer required to be invested in collateralized Brady Bonds, (ii) no changes
to the Fund's charter or by-laws that would delay or prevent a change of
control of the Fund, (iii) no material changes in the principal risk factors
associated with investment in the Fund, and (iv) no change in the person
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio,
who is Paul J. DeNoon, a Vice President of the Fund.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Directors has determined that independent directors
David H. Dievler and William H. Foulk, Jr. qualify as audit committee financial
experts.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

         The following table sets forth the aggregate fees billed by the
independent auditors for the Fund's last two fiscal years for professional
services rendered for: (i) the audit of the Fund's annual financial statements
included in the Fund's annual report to stockholders; (ii) assurance and related
services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the
Fund's financial statements and are not reported under (i), which include advice
and education on accounting and auditing issues, quarterly press release review
and preferred stock maintenance testing (for those Funds that issue preferred
stock); (iii) tax compliance, tax advice and tax return preparation; and (iv)
aggregate non-audit services provided to the Fund, the Fund's Adviser and
entities that control, are controlled by or under common control with the
Adviser that provide ongoing services to the Fund ("Service Affiliates"), which
include conducting an annual internal control report pursuant to Statement on
Auditing Standards No. 70. No other services were provided to the Fund during
this period.



                                                              All Fees for
                                                           Non-Audit Services
                                                            Provided to the
                           Audit-Related                   Fund, the Adviser
            Audit Fees         Fees         Tax Fees   and Service Affiliates

2003:         $51,000         $8,500         $11,600          $700,012
2004:         $51,000         $13,125        $18,900          $935,707

         Beginning with audit and non-audit service contracts entered into on or
after May 6, 2003, the Fund's Audit Committee policies and procedures require
the pre-approval of all audit and non-audit services provided to the Fund by the
Fund's independent auditors. The Fund's Audit Committee policies and procedures
also require pre-approval of all


<PAGE>


audit and non-audit services provided to the Adviser and Service Affiliates to
the extent that these services are directly related to the operations or
financial reporting of the Fund. Accordingly, all of the amounts in the table
for Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees and Tax Fees for 2004 are for services
pre-approved by the Fund's Audit Committee. The amounts of the Fees for
Non-Audit Services provided to the Fund, the Adviser and Service Affiliates in
the table for the Fund, that were subject to pre-approval by the Audit Committee
for 2004 were $394,025 (comprising $375,125 of audit related fees and $18,900 of
tax fees). The Audit Committee of the Fund has considered whether the provision
of any non-audit services not pre-approved by the Audit Committee provided by
the Fund's independent auditor to the Adviser and Service Affiliates is
compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence.

in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant has adopted the following proxy voting policies and procedures of
its investment adviser, Alliance Capital Management L.P.

                                                                       July 2003

                        ALLIANCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT L.P.

                    Statement of Policies and Procedures for
            Voting Proxies on Behalf of Discretionary Client Accounts


Introduction

As a registered investment adviser, Alliance Capital Management L.P. ("Alliance
Capital", "we" or "us") has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests
of our clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client
securities in a timely manner and make voting decisions that are in the best
interests of our clients.


This statement is intended to comply with Rule 206(4)-6 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. It sets forth our policies and procedures for voting

proxies for our discretionary investment advisory clients, including investment
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This statement is
applicable to Alliance Capital's growth and value investment groups investing on
behalf of clients in both US and global securities.


PROXY POLICIES

This statement is designed to be responsive to the wide range of subjects that
can have a significant effect on the investment value of the securities held in
our clients' accounts. These policies are not exhaustive due to the variety of
proxy voting issues that we may be required to consider. Alliance Capital
reserves the right to depart from these guidelines in order to avoid voting
decisions that we believe may be contrary to our clients' best interests. In
reviewing proxy issues, we will apply the following general policies:


Elections of Directors: Unless there is a proxy fight for seats on the Board or
we determine that there are other compelling reasons for withholding votes for
directors, we will vote in favor of the management proposed slate of directors.
That said, we believe that directors have a duty to respond to shareholder
actions that have received significant shareholder support. We may withhold
votes for directors that fail to act on key issues such as failure to implement
proposals to declassify boards, failure to implement a majority vote
requirement, failure to submit a rights plan to a shareholder vote and failure
to act on tender offers where a majority of shareholders have tendered their
shares. In addition, we will withhold votes for directors who fail to attend at
least seventy-five percent of board meetings within a given year without a
reasonable excuse. Finally, we may withhold votes for directors of non-U.S.
issuers where there is insufficient information about the nominees disclosed in
the proxy statement.

Appointment of Auditors: Alliance Capital believes that the company remains in
the best position to choose the auditors and will generally support management's
recommendation. However, we recognize that there may be inherent conflicts when
a company's independent auditor performs substantial non-audit related services
for the company. Therefore, we may vote against the appointment of auditors if
the fees for non-audit related services are disproportionate to the total audit
fees paid by the company or there are other reasons to question the independence
of the company's auditors.

Changes in Capital Structure: Changes in a company's charter, articles of
incorporation or by-laws are often technical and administrative in nature.
Absent a compelling reason to the contrary, Alliance Capital will cast its votes
in accordance with the company's management on such proposals. However, we will
review and analyze on a case-by-case basis any non-routine proposals that are
likely to affect the structure and operation of the company or have a material
economic effect on the company. For example, we will generally support proposals
to increase authorized common stock when it is necessary to implement a stock
split, aid in a restructuring or acquisition or provide a sufficient number of
shares for an employee savings plan, stock option or executive compensation
plan. However, a satisfactory explanation of a company's intentions must be
disclosed in the proxy statement for proposals requesting an increase of greater
than one hundred percent of the shares outstanding. We will oppose increases in
authorized common stock where there is evidence that the shares will be used to
implement a poison


<PAGE>


pill or another form of anti-takeover device, or if the issuance of new shares
could excessively dilute the value of the outstanding shares upon issuance.

Corporate Restructurings, Mergers and Acquisitions: Alliance Capital believes
proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations are an extension of the
investment decision. Accordingly, we will analyze such proposals on a
case-by-case basis, weighing heavily the views of the research analysts that
cover the company and the investment professionals managing the portfolios in
which the stock is held.


Proposals Affecting Shareholder Rights: Alliance Capital believes that certain
fundamental rights of shareholders must be protected. We will generally vote in
favor of proposals that give shareholders a greater voice in the affairs of the
company and oppose any measure that seeks to limit those rights. However, when
analyzing such proposals we will weigh the financial impact of the proposal
against the impairment of shareholder rights.

Corporate Governance: Alliance Capital recognizes the importance of good
corporate governance in ensuring that management and the board of directors
fulfill their obligations to the shareholders. We favor proposals promoting
transparency and accountability within a company. For example, we will vote for
proposals providing for equal access to proxies, a majority of independent
directors on key committees, and separating the positions of chairman and chief
executive officer.

Anti-Takeover Measures: Alliance Capital believes that measures that impede
takeovers or entrench management not only infringe on the rights of shareholders
but may also have a detrimental effect on the value of the company. We will
generally oppose proposals, regardless of whether they are advanced by
management or shareholders, the purpose or effect of which is to entrench
management or dilute shareholder ownership. Conversely, we support proposals
that would restrict or otherwise eliminate anti-takeover measures that have
already been adopted by corporate issuers. For example, we will support
shareholder proposals that seek to require the company to submit a shareholder
rights plan to a shareholder vote. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals to completely redeem or eliminate such plans. Furthermore, we will
generally oppose proposals put forward by management (including blank check
preferred stock, classified boards and supermajority vote requirements) that
appear to be intended as management entrenchment mechanisms.

Executive Compensation: Alliance Capital believes that company management and
the compensation committee of the board of directors should, within reason, be
given latitude to determine the types and mix of compensation and benefit awards
offered. Whether proposed by a shareholder or management, we will review
proposals relating to executive compensation plans on a case-by-case basis to
ensure that the long-term interests of management and shareholders are properly
aligned. We will analyze the proposed plans to ensure that shareholder equity
will not be excessively diluted, the option exercise price is not below market
price on the date of grant and an acceptable number of employees are eligible to
participate in such programs. We will generally oppose plans that permit
repricing of underwater stock options without shareholder approval. Other
factors such as the company's performance and industry practice will generally
be factored into our analysis. We will support proposals to submit severance
packages triggered by a change in control to a shareholder vote and proposals
that seek additional disclosure of executive compensation. Finally, we will
support shareholder proposals requiring companies to expense stock options
because we view them as a large corporate expense.


<PAGE>


Social and Corporate Responsibility: Alliance Capital will review and analyze on
a case-by-case basis proposals relating to social, political and environmental
issues to determine whether they will have a financial impact on shareholder
value. We will vote against proposals that are unduly burdensome or result in
unnecessary and excessive costs to the company. We may abstain from voting on
social proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial impact on
shareholder value.

Proxy Voting Procedures


Proxy Voting Committees

Our growth and value investment groups have formed separate proxy voting
committees to establish general proxy policies for Alliance Capital and consider
specific proxy voting matters as necessary. These committees periodically review
new types of corporate governance issues, evaluate proposals not covered by
these policies and recommend how we should generally vote on such issues. In
addition, the committees, in conjunction with the analyst that covers the
company, contact management and interested shareholder groups as necessary to
discuss proxy issues. Members of the committees include senior investment
personnel and representatives of the Corporate Legal Department. The committees
may also evaluate proxies where we face a potential conflict of interest (as
discussed below). Finally, the committees monitor adherence to guidelines,
industry trends and review the policies contained in this statement from time to
time.


Conflicts of Interest

Alliance Capital recognizes that there may be a potential conflict of interest
when we vote a proxy solicited by an issuer whose retirement plan we manage,
whose retirement plan we administer, or with whom we have another business or
personal relationship that may affect how we vote on the issuer's proxy. We
believe that centralized management of proxy voting, oversight by the proxy
voting committees and adherence to these policies ensures that proxies are voted
with only our clients' best interests in mind. That said, we have implemented
additional procedures to ensure that our votes are not the product of a conflict
of interests, including: (i) requiring anyone involved in the decision making
process to disclose to the chairman of the appropriate proxy committee any
potential conflict that they are aware of and any contact that they have had
with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; (ii) prohibiting employees
involved in the decision making process or vote administration from revealing
how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence
from interested parties; and (iii) where a material conflict of interests
exists, reviewing our proposed vote by applying a series of objective tests and,
where necessary, considering the views of a third party research service to
ensure that our voting decision is consistent with our clients' best interests.
For example, if our proposed vote is consistent with our stated proxy voting
policy, no further review is necessary. If our proposed vote is contrary to our
stated proxy voting policy but is also contrary to management's recommendation,
no further review is necessary. If our proposed vote is contrary to our stated
proxy voting policy or is not covered by our policy, is consistent with
management's recommendation, and is also consistent with the views of an
independent source, no further review is necessary. If our proposed vote is
contrary to our stated proxy voting policy or is not covered by our policy, is
consistent with management's recommendation and is contrary to the views of an
independent source, the proposal is reviewed by the appropriate proxy committee
for final determination.


Proxies of Certain Non-US Issuers

Proxy voting in certain countries requires "share blocking." Shareholders
wishing to vote their proxies must deposit their shares shortly before the date
of the meeting (usually one-week) with a designated depositary. During this
blocking period, shares that will be voted at the meeting cannot be sold until
the meeting has taken place and the shares are returned to the clients'
custodian banks. Alliance Capital may determine that the value of exercising the
vote does not outweigh the detriment of not being able to transact in the shares
during this period. Accordingly, if share blocking is required we may abstain
from voting those shares. In such a situation we would have determined that the
cost of voting exceeds the expected benefit to the client.


Proxy Voting Records

Clients may obtain information about how we voted proxies on their behalf by
contacting their Alliance Capital administrative representative. Alternatively,
clients may make a written request for proxy voting information to: Mark R.
Manley, Senior Vice President & Assistant General Counsel, Alliance Capital
Management L.P., 1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10105.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer

                                Exhibit 10(a)(1)


      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS



I. Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

         The AllianceBernstein Mutual Fund Complex's code of ethics (this
"Code") for the investment companies within the complex (collectively, the
"Funds" and each, a "Company") applies to each Company's Principal Executive
Officer, Principal Financial and Accounting Officer and Controller (the "Covered
Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:


o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
     apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
     relationships;

o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
     documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the Securities and
     Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the
     Company;

o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
     person or persons identified in the Code; and

o    accountability for adherence to the Code.


         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.


II. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

         Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
his position with the Company. For the purposes of this Code, members of the
Covered Officer's family include his or her spouse, children, stepchildren,
financial dependents, parents and stepparents.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and


<PAGE>


the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company because
of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The Company's and the
investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent,
or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and
is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such
conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are
also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the
Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies
and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and
the Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the adviser and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Company's Board of Directors or Trustees (the "Directors") that the Covered
Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more of the other Funds or
of other investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

         Each Covered Officer must:
o    not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
     influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Company
     whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
     the Company;

o    not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
     individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
     of the Company;

o    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
     contemplated for the Company to trade


<PAGE>


     personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation of the
     market effect of such transactions;


          There are some conflict of interest situations, whether involving a
Covered Officer directly or a member of his family, that should always be
discussed with the General Counsel of Alliance Capital Management L.P.
(the "General Counsel"), if material. Examples of these include:

o    service as a director on the board of directors or trustees of any public
     or private company (other than a not-for-profit organization);

o    the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;

o    the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the Company
     has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
     business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and
     not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

o    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
     with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment
     adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
     thereof;

o    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges
     or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio transactions or for
     selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the Covered
     Officer's employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III. Disclosure and Compliance

o    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
     requirements and disclosure controls and procedures generally applicable to
     the Company;

o    each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
     misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside
     the Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors, and to
     governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

o    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
     responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and
     the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
     understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with,
     or submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds;
     and


<PAGE>


o    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with
     the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
     regulations.


IV. Reporting and Accountability

        Each Covered Officer must:

o    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
     Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the General Counsel that he has
     received, read, and understands the Code;

o    annually thereafter affirm to the General Counsel that he has complied with
     the requirements of the Code;

o    complete at least annually a questionnaire relating to affiliations or
     other relationships that may give rise to conflicts of interest;

o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
     Company or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
     that are made in good faith; and

o    notify the General Counsel promptly if he knows of any violation of this
     Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, waivers sought by a
Covered Officer will be considered by the Company's Audit Committee (the
"Committee").

         The Company will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

o    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
     potential violations reported to him;

o    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no material
     violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take any
     further action;

o    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a material violation will
     be reported to the Committee;

o    if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it will
     inform and make a recommendation to the Directors, who will consider
     appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
     modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
     appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
     recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

o    the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and

o    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
     disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. Other Policies and Procedures


         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Company for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Company, the Company's adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, it is
understood that this Code is in all respects separate and apart from, and
operates independently of, any such policies and procedures.. In particular, the
Company's and its investment adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.


VI. Amendments

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Directors, including a
majority of independent directors.


VII. Confidentiality

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Directors, the investment
adviser, their counsel, counsel to the Company and, if deemed appropriate by the
Directors of the Company, to the Directors of the other Funds.


VIII. Internal Use

         The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.


Date: July 22, 2003, as amended March 17, 2004
