ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2011 (UNAUDITED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1.    ORGANIZATION

            Advantage   Advisers  Xanthus  Fund,   L.L.C.  (the  "Company")  was
            organized as a limited  liability company under the laws of Delaware
            in January  1999.  The Company is  registered  under the  Investment
            Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"),  as a  closed-end,
            non-diversified management investment company. The Company's term is
            perpetual unless the Company is otherwise terminated under the terms
            of the Limited Liability Company Agreement dated as of June 5, 2003.
            The Company's  investment  objective is to achieve  maximum  capital
            appreciation.  From the  inception of the  Company,  through July 1,
            2010, the Company pursued its investment objective by investing in a
            portfolio  consisting  primarily of equity  securities of technology
            companies  that derive a major portion of their revenue  directly or
            indirectly  from  business  lines that  benefit  from  technological
            events or  advances.  Commencing  on July 1,  2010,  the  investment
            program was updated to focus on investing in a portfolio  consisting
            generally of equity securities that the investment  adviser believes
            are well  positioned  to benefit  from demand for their  products or
            services,  particularly  companies that can innovate or grow rapidly
            relative to their peers in their  markets.  These type of  companies
            are  generally  considered to be "growth  companies."  The Company's
            portfolio  of  securities  is  expected  to  include  long and short
            positions  primarily  in  equity  securities  of U.S.  and  non-U.S.
            companies.  Equity securities include common and preferred stock and
            other   securities   having   equity   characteristics,    including
            convertible debt securities, stock options, warrants and rights.

            Responsibility  for the overall  management  and  supervision of the
            operations of the Company is vested in the  individuals who serve as
            the Board of  Managers of the  Company  (the  "Board of  Managers").
            There  are six  members  of the  Board of  Managers,  one of whom is
            considered an "interested person" of the Company under the Act. From
            inception until July 1, 2011, the Company's  investment  adviser was
            Advantage Advisers Management,  L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability
            company  ("AAM").   Effective  July  1,  2011,   Advantage  Advisers
            Multi-Manager, L.L.C. ("Multi-Manager"), a subsidiary of Oppenheimer
            Asset  Management Inc. ("OAM") and an affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co.
            Inc.  ("Oppenheimer")  became the Company's  investment  adviser and
            Multi-Manager was retained to provide administrative services to the
            Company pursuant to a new administrative  services agreement.  Prior
            to these  changes being  effective,  the Company made a tender offer
            with   respect   to  100%  of  the   Company's   Members'   Capital.
            Multi-Manager  is responsible for managing the Company's  investment
            activities  pursuant to an investment  advisory agreement dated July
            1, 2011.  OAM is the  managing  member of  Multi-Manager  and Alkeon
            Capital  Management  L.L.C.  ("Alkeon") is a non-managing  member of
            Multi-Manager;  together  they make up the Special  Advisory  Member
            ("Special Advisory Member").  Investment  professionals  employed by
            Alkeon,  including Mr. Takis Sparaggis,  who serves as the Company's
            portfolio  manager,  manage  the  Company's  portfolio  on behalf of
            Multi-Manager   under  the   supervision   of  OAM   pursuant  to  a
            Sub-Investment  Advisory  Agreement dated July 1, 2011.  Oppenheimer
            has  a  minority  profit  participation  interest  in  Alkeon  until
            November 13, 2011.

ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2011 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1.    ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

            The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from persons
            who  purchase  interests  in the Company  ("Member")  are subject to
            approval by the Board of Managers. The Company may from time to time
            offer  to  repurchase  interests  pursuant  to  written  tenders  by
            Members.  Such  repurchases  will be made at such  times and on such
            terms as may be determined by the Board of Managers, in its complete
            and exclusive  discretion.  Multi-Manager  expects that generally it
            will  recommend to the Board of Managers  that the Company  offer to
            repurchase  interests from Members twice each year, effective at the
            end of the second fiscal quarter and again at the end of the year.

            Generally,  except as provided under  applicable law, a member shall
            not be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities
            in any  amount in  excess of the  capital  account  balance  of such
            member,  plus  such  member's  share of  undistributed  profits  and
            assets.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with U.S.
            generally accepted accounting  principles  (hereafter referred to as
            "authoritative  guidance") requires  Multi-Manager to make estimates
            and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial
            statements and accompanying notes.  Multi-Manager  believes that the
            estimates utilized in preparing the Company's  financial  statements
            are  reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ
            from these estimates.

            In January 2010, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB")
            issued   Accounting   Standards   Update  No.   2010-06,   IMPROVING
            DISCLOSURES  ABOUT  FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS  ("ASU  2010-06").  ASU
            2010-06 amends  authoritative  guidance to add new  requirements for
            disclosures  about  transfers  into  and out of  Levels 1 and 2, and
            separate  disclosures  about  purchases,   sales,   issuances,   and
            settlements  relating  to Level 3  measurements.  This  update  also
            clarifies  existing  fair  value  disclosures  about  the  level  of
            disaggregation  for the  classes of assets and  liabilities  and the
            disclosures  about  the  inputs  and  valuation  techniques  used to
            measure  fair value.  ASU 2010-06 is  effective  for the interim and
            annual  periods  beginning  after  December 15, 2009 and for periods
            beginning  after  December 15, 2010 for the new Level 3 disclosures.
            The Company  adopted the standard  effective  December 31, 2010. The
            adoption did not have a material  effect on the Company's  financial
            statements.

            The following is a summary of the Company's accounting policies:

            A.    REVENUE RECOGNITION

            Securities transactions, including related revenue and expenses, are
            recorded on a trade-date  basis,  and  dividends are recorded on the
            ex-dividend  date,  net of applicable  withholding  taxes.  Interest
            income and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and
            discounts  on  fixed  income  securities  are  amortized  using  the
            effective interest rate method.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

            B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

            The Company's securities are valued at fair value in accordance with
            policies  adopted  by the Board of  Managers,  which are  summarized
            below.

            (i)   Domestic  exchange traded  securities  (other than options and
                  those securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

                  (1)   at their last  composite  sale price as  reported on the
                        exchanges where those securities are traded; or

                  (2)   if no  sales  of  those  securities  are  reported  on a
                        particular  day,  the  securities  are valued based upon
                        their  composite bid price for securities  held long, or
                        their composite asked price for securities sold, not yet
                        purchased, as reported by those exchanges.

            (ii)  Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

                  (1)   at the NASDAQ Official  Closing Price ("NOCP") (which is
                        the last  trade  price at or before  4:00 p.m.  (Eastern
                        Time)  adjusted up to  NASDAQ's  best offer price if the
                        last traded price is below such bid and down to NASDAQ's
                        best  offer  price if the last trade is above such offer
                        price); or

                  (2)   if no NOCP is  available  at the last sale  price on the
                        NASDAQ prior to the  calculation  of the net asset value
                        of the Company; or

                  (3)   if no sale is shown on NASDAQ at the bid price; or

                  (4)   if no sale is shown and no bid price is  available,  the
                        price  will be  deemed  "stale"  and the  value  will be
                        determined  in  accordance   with  the  fair   valuation
                        procedures set forth herein.

      Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange  are valued at their
      last sale  price on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are  primarily
      traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular day, at their
      bid price (in the case of  securities  held  long) or asked  price (in the
      case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported by such exchange.
      Listed  options  are valued at their bid price (or asked price in the case
      of listed  written  options) as reported by the exchange  with the highest
      volume on the last day a trade was reported.  Other  securities  for which
      market  quotations are readily available are valued at their bid price (or
      asked price in the case of securities sold, not yet purchased) as obtained
      from one or more dealers  making markets for those  securities.  If market
      quotations are not readily available, the fair value of the securities and
      other assets are determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of,
      the Board of Managers.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (CONTINUED)

            B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

            Foreign-denominated  assets may  involve  more  risks than  domestic
            transactions,  including political,  economic,  and regulatory risk.
            Risks may also arise from the potential  inability of a counterparty
            to meet the terms of a contract and from unanticipated  movements in
            the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

            Securities  associated  with swaps are valued in accordance with the
            procedures  described above,  net of any contractual  terms with the
            counterparty.

            Debt  securities  are  valued  in  accordance  with  the  procedures
            described  above,  which with respect to such securities may include
            the use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a
            matrix to determine valuation for normal  institutional size trading
            units or consultation  with brokers and dealers in such  securities.
            The Board of Managers will periodically  monitor the  reasonableness
            of valuations provided by any such pricing service.  Debt securities
            with  remaining  maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual
            circumstances,  be  valued  at  amortized  cost,  so  long  as  such
            valuation is determined  by the Board of Managers to represent  fair
            value.

            All assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies
            are  converted  into  U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
            provided by a pricing service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m. London time.
            Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values
            of such securities are determined,  prior to the close of securities
            markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior
            to such  close.  On  occasion,  the  values of such  securities  and
            exchange rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time
            such values or exchange  rates are  determined and the time that the
            net asset  value of the  Company  is  determined.  When such  events
            materially  affect the values of  securities  held by the Company or
            its liabilities,  such securities and liabilities are fair valued as
            determined in good faith by, or under the  supervision of, the Board
            of Managers.

            The determination of fair value shall take into account the relevant
            factors and surrounding  circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the
            nature  and  pricing  history  (if  any) of the  security  or  other
            investment;  (ii) whether any dealer quotations are available; (iii)
            possible  valuation  methodologies  that could be used to  determine
            fair value; (iv) the recommendation of Multi-Manager with respect to
            the valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar  securities or other
            investments  are held by other  accounts or other  funds  managed by
            Multi-Manager  and the valuation method used by  Multi-Manager  with
            respect  thereto;  (vi) the  extent  to which  the fair  value to be
            determined will result from the use of data or formulae  produced by
            third parties independent of Multi-Manager;  and (vii) the liquidity
            or illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  (CONTINUED)

            B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

            The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify
            as financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented
            in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

            During the six months  ended June 30,  2011,  the  Company  followed
            authoritative guidance for fair value measurement. The authoritative
            guidance  establishes  a framework  for  measuring  fair value and a
            hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the
            use of  observable  inputs  and  minimizes  the use of  unobservable
            inputs by  requiring  that the most  observable  inputs be used when
            available.  The authoritative  guidance  establishes three levels of
            inputs in the hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value.

            Various  inputs are used in  determining  the value of the Company's
            investments.  These inputs are  summarized in the three broad levels
            listed below.

            Level 1 - observable market inputs that are unadjusted quoted prices
            for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

            Level 2 -- other  significant  observable  inputs  (including quoted
            prices for similar securities,  interest rates,  prepayments speeds,
            credit risk, etc.).

            Level 3 -- significant  unobservable inputs (including the Company's
            own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

            The Company  recognizes  transfers into and out of levels  indicated
            above at the end of the reporting period.

            The  inputs  or  methodology  used for  valuing  securities  are not
            necessarily an indication of the risk  associated  with investing in
            these securities.

            Additional  information  on  the  investments  can be  found  in the
            Schedule of Portfolio Investments,  the Schedule of Securities Sold,
            Not Yet Purchased and the Schedule of Swap Contracts.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT   ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED)

            C.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

            The Company  treats all highly  liquid  financial  instruments  that
            mature  within  three  months  at  the  time  of  purchase  as  cash
            equivalents.  Restricted  cash  listed in the  Statement  of Assets,
            Liabilities and Members'  Capital  represents funds held by The Bank
            of New York Mellon (the  "Custodian")  for  securities  sold not yet
            purchased,  swap contracts and other derivatives.  At June 30, 2011,
            $134,727,180  in cash  equivalents  was held at the  Custodian  in a
            money market account and foreign  currency with a U.S.  Dollar value
            of $22,062,004 was held by the Custodian.

            D.    INCOME TAXES

            The Company  has  reclassified  $25,608,206  and  $122,572,344  from
            accumulated net investment loss and accumulated net realized gain on
            investments,  respectively,  to net capital contributions during the
            year ended December 31, 2010. This  reclassification was a result of
            permanent book to tax  differences  to reflect,  as an adjustment to
            net  capital  contributions,  the  amounts of  taxable  loss and net
            realized  gain  on  investments  that  have  been  allocated  to the
            Company's Members and had no effect on Members' Capital.

            In accordance with authoritative  guidance,  Management has analyzed
            the  Company's  tax position for all open tax years (tax years ended
            December  31,  2007-2010),  and has  concluded  that a liability  of
            $3,142,315  capital  gain  country tax is required in the  Company's
            financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties,
            if any,  related to country  tax  expense  within the  Statement  of
            Operations.  During  the  period,  the  Company  did not  record any
            interest or penalties.

            Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return
            its distributive share of the Company's taxable income or loss.

      3.    ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

            From the inception of the Company until July 1, 2011, administrative
            services were provided by  Oppenheimer  at a monthly  administration
            fee  of  0.08333%  (1% on an  annualized  basis)  of  the  Company's
            members' capital determined as of the beginning of the month.

            During  the six  months  ended  June 30,  2011,  Oppenheimer  earned
            $60,699  as  brokerage   commissions  from  portfolio   transactions
            executed  on  behalf  of the  Company.  Mainsail  Group,  L.L.C.,  a

      3.    ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

            Net profits or net losses of the Company for each fiscal  period are
            allocated  among and  credited  to or debited  against  the  capital
            accounts of all Members (but not the Special  Advisory Member) as of
            the last day of each  fiscal  period  in  accordance  with  Members'
            respective  investment   percentages  for  the  fiscal  period.  The
            investment  adviser to the  Company,  in its capacity as the Special
            Advisory Member of the Company,  is entitled to receive an incentive
            allocation  (the  "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged to the  capital
            account of each Member as of the last day of each allocation period,
            of 20% of the  amount  by which  net  profits,  if any,  exceed  the
            positive  balance  in the  Member's  "loss  recovery  account."  The
            Incentive  Allocation is credited to the  investment  advisor to the
            Company. By the last business day of the month following the date on
            which an Incentive Allocation is made, the investment adviser to the
            Company may withdraw up to 100% of the Incentive Allocation that was
            credited  to  the  Special  Advisory  Account  with  respect  to the
            allocation  period.  During the six months ended June 30,  2011,  an
            Incentive Allocation of $842,412 was credited to the capital account
            of AAM as Special  Advisory  member and was included in  withdrawals
            payable at June 30, 2011,  in the  Statement of Assets,  Liabilities
            and Members' Capital.

            Each Member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not
            an  "interested  person"  of the  Company,  as  defined  by the Act,
            receives an annual  retainer of $15,000  plus a fee for each meeting
            attended.  The lead  independent  Manager and the chair of the audit
            committee  receive a supplemental  retainer of $7,500 and $3,750 per
            annum,  respectively.  Managers who are "interested  persons" do not
            receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.  Managers who are
            not  "interested  persons"  are  reimbursed  by the  Company for all
            reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by them in  performing
            their duties.

            The Bank of New York Mellon  serves as  custodian  of the  Company's
            assets.

            BNY Mellon  Investment  Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNY Mellon") serves as
            accounting  and investor  services  agent to the Company and in that
            capacity  provides certain  accounting,  recordkeeping  and investor
            related  services.  The  Company  pays BNY  Mellon  a fee for  these
            services  based  primarily  on the average  Members'  Capital of the
            Company as of the last day of each month,  payable monthly,  subject
            to a minimum annual fee.

            Oppenheimer  acts  as the  non-exclusive  placement  agent  for  the
            Company,  without special  compensation from the Company,  and bears
            costs  associated with its activities as placement  agent.  However,
            the placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission of up
            to 3% (up to 3.1%  of the  amount  invested)  in  connection  with a
            purchase of interests,  at its discretion.  For the six months ended
            June 30, 2011, such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted
            to $191,442.

      4.    INDEMNIFICATIONS

            The Company has entered into several  contracts that contain routine
            indemnification  clauses. The Company's maximum exposure under these
            arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve  future claims that
            may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However,
            based on  experience,  the  Company  expects  the risk of loss to be
            remote.

      5.    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

            Aggregate  purchases and sales of investment  securities,  excluding
            short-term  securities,  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2011,
            amounted to $913,212,448 and $560,024,007,  respectively.  Aggregate
            purchases and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased, excluding
            short-term  securities,  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2011,
            amounted to $430,967,694 and $589,822,526, respectively.

            At December  31, 2010,  the  aggregate  cost for Federal  income tax
            purposes of  portfolio  investments  and  securities  sold,  not yet
            purchased was $863,722,137 and $414,298,191, respectively.

            For Federal income tax purposes,  at December 31, 2010,  accumulated
            net unrealized gain on portfolio  investments  and securities  sold,
            not yet purchased was $129,486,820, consisting of $207,531,152 gross
            unrealized gain and $78,044,332 gross unrealized loss.

            Due from broker primarily  represents proceeds from securities sold,
            not yet purchased,  net of excess cash,  held at the prime broker as
            of June 30, 2011, and is used as collateral for securities sold, not
            yet purchased.

      6.    SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

            The Company has the ability to trade on margin and borrow funds from
            brokers  and  banks  for  investment  purposes.  Trading  in  equity
            securities   on  margin   involves  an  initial   cash   requirement
            representing  at least 50% of the underlying  security's  value with
            respect to transactions in U.S. markets and varying percentages with
            respect to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act requires the
            Company  to  satisfy an asset  coverage  requirement  of 300% of its
            indebtedness,  including amounts borrowed,  measured at the time the
            Company  incurs the  indebtedness.  The  Company  pays  interest  on
            outstanding  margin  borrowings at an annualized  rate of LIBOR plus
            0.875%.  The Company pledges securities as collateral for the margin
            borrowings, which are maintained in a segregated account held by the
            Custodian. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, the average daily
            amount of such  borrowings  was  $2,126,202  and the daily  weighted
            average  annualized   interest  rate  was  2.13%.  The  Company  had
            borrowings   outstanding  at  June  30,  2011,  totaling  $1,272,877
            recorded as due to broker on the  Statement  of Assets,  Liabilities
            and Members' Capital.

      7.    FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS
            OF CREDIT RISK

            In the normal  course of  business,  the Company  may trade  various
            financial  instruments and enter into various investment  activities
            with  off-balance  sheet risk. These financial  instruments  include
            options,   swaps  and  short  sales.   Generally,   these  financial
            instruments  represent future  commitments to purchase or sell other
            financial  instruments at specific terms at specified  future dates.
            Each of these  financial  instruments  contains  varying  degrees of
            off-balance  sheet risk  whereby  changes in the market value of the
            securities  underlying the financial instruments may be in excess of
            the amounts  recognized in the Statement of Assets,  Liabilities and
            Members' Capital.

            The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times,
            may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced
            any losses in such  accounts  and does not  believe it is exposed to
            any significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

            Securities  sold,  not yet purchased  represent  obligations  of the
            Company  to  deliver  specified  securities  and  thereby  creates a
            liability to purchase  such  securities  in the market at prevailing
            prices. Accordingly,  these transactions result in off-balance sheet
            risk as the  Company's  ultimate  obligation  to satisfy the sale of
            securities  sold, not yet purchased may exceed the amount  indicated
            in the  Statement  of  Assets,  Liabilities  and  Members'  Capital.
            Primarily all investments in securities  sold, not yet purchased and
            due from broker are positions  with, and amounts due from, the prime
            broker, Morgan Stanley. Accordingly, the Company has a concentration
            of individual  counterparty  credit risk with the prime broker.  The
            Company pledges  securities in an account at the Custodian,  for the
            benefit  of the prime  broker,  to meet the  margin  requirement  as
            determined by the prime broker.

            Multi-Manager  may use  total  return  swaps  to gain  long or short
            investment  exposure  in lieu of  purchasing  or  selling  an equity
            security  directly.  A swap is a contract  under  which two  parties
            agree to make  periodic  payments to each other  based on  specified
            interest  rates,  an index or the  value of some  other  instrument,
            applied to a stated,  or "notional"  amount.  Swaps generally can be
            classified as interest rate swaps,  currency swaps,  commodity swaps
            or equity swaps which can also  include  contracts  for  difference,
            depending on the type of index or  instrument  used to calculate the
            payments.  Such swaps  would  increase  or  decrease  the  Company's
            investment  exposure  to the  particular  interest  rate,  currency,
            commodity or equity involved.  Securities  associated with swaps are
            marked-to-market  based on the Company's  valuation  procedures that
            are  outlined in Section 2b of these  notes.  The change in value of
            swaps,  including  the  periodic  amounts of  interest to be paid or
            received on swaps, is reported as net change in unrealized  gains or
            losses in the  Statement of  Operations.  Net  unrealized  gains are
            reported  as an asset and net  unrealized  losses are  reported as a
            liability  on the  Statement  of Assets,  Liabilities  and  Members'
            Capital. A realized gain or loss is recorded upon payment or receipt
            of a periodic  payment or  termination of swap  agreements.  The net
            realized gain/(loss) on swap contracts is reflected on the Statement
            of Operations within these financial statements.

      7.    FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS
            OF CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

            Most  swap  agreements  entered  into  by the  Company  require  the
            calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a
            "net basis."  Consequently,  current obligations (or rights) under a
            swap agreement  generally will be equal to only the net amount to be
            paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of
            the  positions  held  by  each  party  to the  agreement  (the  "net
            amount").  However,  the  gross  unrealized  gain  and  loss on swap
            contracts are $5,256,103  and  $2,975,596,  respectively,  which are
            included in the net unrealized  gain on swap contracts  reflected on
            the Statement of Assets,  Liabilities  and Members'  Capital  within
            these financial statements.

            The Company is subject to the market risk associated with changes in
            the value of the  underlying  investment or  instrument,  as well as
            exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance
            on swap contracts. The risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited
            to the net amount of  payments  that the  Company  is  contractually
            obligated  to  make.  If the  other  party to a swap  defaults,  the
            Company's  risk of loss  consists of the net amount of payments that
            the Company  contractually  is  entitled  to  receive,  which may be
            different  than the  amounts  recorded on the  Statement  of Assets,
            Liabilities and Members'Capital.

            The unrealized gain/(loss) amounts presented in the Schedule of Swap
            Contracts,   rather  than  the  notional   amount,   represents  the
            approximate  future  cash to be  received  or paid,  (i.e.  the fair
            value) of each swap  contract,  respectively.  The average  notional
            amounts of swap  contracts  was  $325,745,915  during the six months
            ended June 30, 2011,  which is  indicative of the volume of activity
            for swap contracts  during the period.  The net change in unrealized
            gain/(loss)  from swap  contracts is  reflected on the  Statement of
            Operations within these financial statements.

            The total return swap agreements contain provisions that require the
            Company to maintain a predetermined level of Members' Capital and/or
            provide limits regarding  decline in the Company's  Members' Capital
            over one  month,  three  months  and twelve  month  periods.  If the
            Company were to violate such  provisions,  the  counterparty  to the
            total return swap  agreements  could  terminate  the  agreement  and
            request immediate payment or demand increased collateral for the net
            obligation owed the  counter-party.  Throughout the six months ended
            June  30,  2011,  the  Company  maintained  the  required  level  of
            Company's Members' Capital.

            As of June 30, 2011, the Company  posted  $90,498,345 as collateral,
            related to its total  return  swaps.  This amount is included in the
            cash and cash  equivalents  on the Statement of Assets,  Liabilities
            and  Members'  Capital  within  these  financial  statements  and is
            restricted.

      7.    FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS
            OF CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

            The Company  may  purchase  put and call  options on  securities  or
            derivatives  instruments  in order to gain  exposure  to or  protect
            against changes in the markets.  The risk associated with purchasing
            an option is that the  Company  pays a  premium  whether  or not the
            option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the Company  bears the risk of
            loss of premium and change in market value  should the  counterparty
            not perform under the contract.  Put and call options  purchased are
            accounted  for in the same manner as investment  securities.  During
            the six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company had no  transactions
            in purchased options.

            The Company may write (sell) put and call options on  securities  or
            derivative  instruments  in order  to gain  exposure  to or  protect
            against changes in the markets. Option contracts serve as components
            of the Company's investment strategies and are utilized to structure
            investments to enhance the performance of the Company.

            When the  Company  writes an option,  the  premium  received  by the
            Company is recorded as a liability and is  subsequently  adjusted to
            the current  market value of the option  written.  If a written call
            option is  exercised,  the premium is added to the proceeds from the
            sale of the underlying  security in determining  whether the Company
            has realized a gain or loss.  If a written put option is  exercised,
            the premium  reduces the cost basis of the  securities  purchased by
            the Company. In writing an option, the Company bears the market risk
            of an  unfavorable  change  in the  price of the  security  or index
            underlying  the written  option.  Exercise of a written  option by a
            counterparty  could  result  in the  Company  selling  or  buying  a
            security at a price different from the current market value.  During
            the six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company had no  transactions
            in written options.

            The Company  follows  authoritative  guidance on  disclosures  about
            derivative   instruments  and  hedging   activities.   Authoritative
            guidance  requires  qualitative  disclosures  about  objectives  and
            strategies for using  derivatives,  quantitative  disclosures  about
            fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and
            disclosures  about   credit-risk-related   contingent   features  in
            derivative agreements.  All accounting policies and disclosures have
            been  made  in  accordance  with  authoritative   guidance  and  are
            incorporated  for the  current  period  as  part of the  disclosures
            within this Note.

III. RENEWAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT WITH AAM

At a meeting held on March 23,  2011,  the Board of Managers of the Company (the
"Board") completed its annual consideration of, and approved the renewal of, the
Company's investment advisory agreement with AAM.

In  approving  the  renewal of the  investment  advisory  agreement,  the Board,
including each of the Independent  Managers,  reviewed various written materials
provided by AAM at the request of the Board and assessed: (i) the nature, extent
and  quality  of the  services  provided  to the  Company;  (ii) the  investment
performance of the Company  relative to other comparable  funds;  (iii) advisory
fees and other fees and expenses of the Company  (including fee  information for
comparable  funds)  and the  profitability  of AAM;  (iv)  the  extent  to which
economies of scale would be realized as the  Company's  assets under  management
increase;  and (v) whether  advisory  fee levels  reflect any such  economies of
scale for the benefit of  investors.  The Board also approved the renewal of the
administrative  services  agreement  between  the Company  and  Oppenheimer,  an
affiliate of AAM, which provides certain administrative services to the Company.

In considering  the nature,  extent and quality of services that AAM provides to
the  Company,  the Board  reviewed  presentations  from  management  relating to
staffing, management and the organizational structure of the various departments
of Oppenheimer  providing services to the Company.  The Board also reviewed with
management the investment management,  compliance,  regulatory, risk management,
administration, accounting, infrastructure and investor services provided by AAM
and Oppenheimer and reviewed the costs associated with providing these services.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Independent  Managers had, over the previous twelve months,  also considered
various matters,  including:  Oppenheimer's commitment to the advisory business,
including the  alternative  investment  advisory  business,  and its platform of
proprietary products; the research and portfolio management  capabilities of the
personnel  responsible for managing the Company's assets; the appropriateness of
AAM's  staffing  levels and the  commitment of resources to fund  accounting and
administration,  shareholder services and regulatory compliance; AAM's oversight
of third party service providers;  the Company's investment  performance and the
profitability  of AAM attributable to providing  services to the Company,  among
other matters.

Based on its review,  the Board  concluded  that the Company  benefits  from the
services provided by AAM, including research and portfolio  management  services
and also benefits from the administrative services and compliance infrastructure
provided by AAM and Oppenheimer.  The Board noted its overall  satisfaction with
the nature,  extent and quality of services  provided by AAM and concluded  that
the Company was  receiving  the services  required  from AAM under its agreement
with the Company, and that these services were of appropriate quality.

The  Board  also  reviewed  materials  relating  to  the  Company's   investment
performance  on a  quarterly  basis.  The Board also  considered  the  Company's
historical investment performance, including a comparison of such performance to
the  performance  of similar  funds and relevant  indices.  The consensus of the
Board was that during the past year the  investment  performance  of the Company
was competitive  with its peers. The indirect  benefits  received by AAM and its
affiliates   attributable  to  its   relationships  to  the  Company  also  were
considered.

The Board also  considered the advisory fees and current and historical  expense
ratios of the Company for the services provided by AAM and Oppenheimer under the
investment   advisory   agreement   and   administrative   services   agreement,
respectively.   The  Independent  Managers  concluded  that  the  fees  paid  to
Oppenheimer  and AAM were  reasonable and  appropriate  and were within industry
norms,  based  on  the  comparisons  to  similar  funds.  In  particular,  a fee
comparison  showed  that  the  fees  charged  -- a 1.0%  management  fee and 20%
incentive allocation -- were at the mid-to-lower end of fees charged for similar
products.  In this regard, the Board reviewed a comparison of the Company's fees
to those of comparable  registered  funds, and concluded that the Company's fees
are  similar to those of the other  funds.  The Board also  considered  revenues
received by AAM and Oppenheimer  from the Company,  including  management  fees,
incentive  allocations  and investment  income,  as well as data regarding AAM's
financial  condition,  compensation and profitability,  including related direct
and  indirect  operating  expenses  relating to the  Company,  payments  made to
registered representatives of Oppenheimer for services they provide to investors
and   marketing   and  sales   expenses.   The  Board   noted  that   registered
representatives  of  Oppenheimer  continue  to  be  paid  out  of  Oppenheimer's
resources for providing various investor services.  The Board noted that AAM had
not realized  significant profits during the previous year from its relationship
with the Company but continues to be willing to manage the Company. AAM reviewed
with the Board the methodology  used to estimate these costs and profits of AAM,
as set forth in the  profitability  materials  provided by  management.  It also
considered the indirect benefits received by AAM and its affiliates attributable
to their relationships to the Company.

Based on its review of  information  relating to the Company's fees and expenses
and the profitability of AAM

                                      -42-

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and its  affiliates,  the Board  concluded  that the  Company's  fees  under the
investment  advisory  agreement and  administrative  services  agreement  bear a
reasonable relationship to the services provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer.

With respect to whether the Company  benefits  from  economies of scale in costs
associated  with  services  provided to the Company,  the Board  concluded  that
material economies of scale are not being realized at current asset levels.

Based on the  considerations  described  above,  the following  conclusions  and
determinations  were  made  by the  Board,  including  all  of  the  Independent
Managers:

      1.    the nature,  extent and quality of the services provided by AAM were
            adequate and appropriate;

      2.    the fees paid to AAM and  Oppenheimer are reasonable and appropriate
            in light of both  comparative  fee  information  and  benefits to be
            derived by AAM and  Oppenheimer  from their  relationships  with the
            Company;

      3.    AAM's fees are  reasonable  in light of the advisory fees charged by
            AAM  (and  other  affiliates)  and  other  unaffiliated   investment
            advisers to similar  investment  vehicles receiving similar services
            and in light of the fact that,  absent any  performance  allocation,
            the expenses  associated with providing  services to the Company had
            exceeded in the past, and may exceed in the future, the fees payable
            by the Company;

      4.    material  economies  of  scale  are  not  being  realized  by AAM or
            Oppenheimer at current asset levels.

      5.    the  approval of the renewal of the  Company's  investment  advisory
            agreement and  administrative  services  agreement for an additional
            annual  period  is in the  best  interests  of the  Company  and its
            Members.

REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF NEW INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND NEW SUB-INVESTMENT
ADVISORY AGREEMENT

At a  meeting  held on  April  26,  2011,  the  Board  approved  a  proposal  to
restructure  the  Company's  management  arrangements  and to increase  the fees
payable by the Company (the "Restructuring").  As a result of the Restructuring,
effective   July  1,   2011:   (i)   Advantage   Advisers   Multi-Manager,   LLC
("Multi-Manager")  replaced  Advantage Advisers  Management,  LLC ("AAM") as the
Company's  investment adviser pursuant to the terms of a new investment advisory
agreement (the "New Investment Advisory Agreement");  (ii) the Company agreed to
pay  Multi-Manager  an advisory fee at the annual rate of .40% of the  Company's
net assets;  (iii) Alkeon Capital Management,  LLC was retained by Multi-Manager
to  provide  portfolio   management  services  to  the  Company  pursuant  to  a
sub-investment advisory agreement (the "Sub-Advisory Agreement") at a fee at the
annual rate of .30% of the net assets of the Company; and (iv) Multi-Manager was
retained to provide  administrative  services  to the Company  pursuant to a new
administrative  services agreement (the "New Services  Agreement") for an annual
fee of 1.35% of the Company's net assets.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In  determining  to approve the New  Advisory  Agreement  and to  recommend  its
approval by Members,  the Board considered all information it deemed  reasonably
necessary to evaluate the terms of the new Advisory Agreement and the ability of
Multi-Manager to provide  services of the nature,  scope and quality required by
the Company. The Independent Managers requested and reviewed materials furnished
by OAM,  including  information  regarding  Multi-Manager,  its  affiliates  and
personnel,  operations and financial  condition,  and also reviewed  information
relating to the  investment  performance  and the current and proposed  fees and
expenses of the Company as compared to similar  investment funds. The Board also
met with  representatives  of OAM and discussed  various matters relating to the
operations of the Company and Multi-Manager and to the nature, scope and quality
of services that Multi-Manager would provide to the Company.

Approximately  one month before,  in March 2011,  the Board had performed a full
annual review of the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement  with AAM after  reviewing
among other things, the staffing, management and the organizational structure of
the various  departments of  Oppenheimer  and Alkeon  providing  services to the
Company,   including  investment  management,   compliance,   regulatory,   risk
management,  administration,  accounting,  infrastructure and investor services.
The Board's considerations and conclusions are described above.

As described  above,  the  Independent  Managers had,  over the previous  twelve
months, also considered various matters,  including Oppenheimer's  commitment to
the advisory business,  including the alternative  investment advisory business,
and its platform of proprietary products;  the research and portfolio management
capabilities of the personnel responsible for managing the Company's assets; the
appropriateness  of staffing  levels and the  commitment  of  resources  to fund
accounting and administration,  shareholder services and regulatory  compliance;
oversight  of third  party  services  providers;  and the  Company's  investment
performance, among other matters.

In  evaluating  the  proposed   compensation  payable  under  the  New  Advisory
Agreement,  the  Independent  Managers  also  gave  weight  to the fact that the
Company's  investment program has become more complex,  involving greater use of
derivatives  and  investments  in foreign  securities,  and to the fact that the
recent expansion of the Company's investment focus to encompass investments in a
broad range of domestic  and foreign  growth  companies  (and not  primarily  in
stocks  of   technology-related   companies)   necessitates  the  employment  of
additional  investment   professionals  having  a  broader  set  of  skills  and
experience  than was previously  required.  The  Independent  Managers viewed as
significant  the fact that OAM  personnel  will  continue  to  provide  the same
services  to the  Company  on behalf  of  Multi-Manager  under the New  Advisory
Agreement  that they provide  currently on behalf of AAM, and that  personnel of
Alkeon who currently  provide advisory services to the Company through AAM under
the  current  investment  advisory  agreement  between the Company and AAM would
continue to provide investment  advisory services to the Company pursuant to the
Sub-Advisory Agreement. For these reasons, the Board determined that an increase
in the compensation  payable under the New Advisory  Agreement is reasonable and
appropriate  and that  such  compensation  is also  necessary  to  appropriately
compensate  the  organizations  and their  personnel  providing  services to the
Company.

ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With respect to the compensation  payable under the New Advisory Agreement,  the
Board also compared the current and proposed  fees and overall  expense level of
the Company to those of other funds with similar investment programs,  including
but not limited to other fund  advised by  affiliates  of  Multi-Manager  and by
Alkeon  (or  an  Alkeon  affiliate).   It  was  noted,  in  this  regard,  that,
notwithstanding  the  changes  in fees that are being  proposed  or  implemented
(including  the advisory  fee and the increase in the fee payable  under the New
Services Agreement), the Company will continue to have overall fees and expenses
that are  within  the  range  of or lower  than  those  of other  similar  funds
registered  under the 1940 Act. The Board also considered the anticipated  costs
of services to be provided and an estimate of the profits  likely to be realized
by  Multi-Manager  from its  relationship  with the  Company and  reviewed  with
representatives of OAM the methodology used in estimating  Multi-Manager's costs
and  profits.  The extent to which  economies  of scale in the cost of providing
services  would be realized as the Company grows and whether the fees payable to
Multi-Manager  pursuant to the New Advisory  Agreement  properly  reflect  these
economies  of scale for the benefit of Members  were also  considered.  Although
there are no reductions in the compensation payable by the Company under the New
Advisory  Agreement  that would apply as its assets  increase,  the  Independent
Managers,  determined,  in light of the  nature,  quality  and scope of services
proposed to be provided,  the  anticipated  costs of those services and the fees
paid by similar funds, that the estimated  profitability of Multi-Manager  would
not be so disproportionately large that it would bear no reasonable relationship
to the  services  that  will be  provided  by  Multi-Manager.  In  making  these
determinations,  the  Independent  Managers  took  cognizance  of the fact  that
Oppenheimer  compensates its financial  advisers for providing  ongoing investor
services to Members  relating to the Company and that,  unlike a number of other
similar funds,  Oppenheimer  does not receive a separate fee from the Company as
compensation for these services.

The Independent  Managers also considered the potential  indirect  benefits that
might be realized by Multi-Manager  from its  relationship  with the Company and
considered possible  alternatives to approval of the New Advisory Agreement.  In
this  regard,  the  Independent   Managers  evaluated  the  potential  benefits,
detriments  and costs to the  Company  and Members of  retaining  an  investment
adviser other than Multi-Manager (or another Oppenheimer  affiliated  investment
adviser)  as  the  Company's  investment  adviser  and  determined  that,  as an
affiliate of OAM,  Multi-Manager  has the  requisite  expertise,  personnel  and
resources to enable it to provide high quality services to the Company.

The  Independent   Managers   considered  similar  information  and  factors  in
determining  whether to approve the  Sub-Advisory  Agreement,  and  reviewed and
discussed the qualifications and experience of Alkeon and its personnel. It also
considered  the  historic  investment   performance  of  the  Company  which  is
attributable to the services of Alkeon personnel providing services on behalf of
AAM.

In its  deliberations,  the  Independent  Managers  considered the fact that the
Company has been provided with very high quality investment advice over a period
of many years,  as demonstrated  by the historic  investment  performance of the
Company  since its  inception.  The  Independent  Managers  also  evaluated  the
investment  performance of the Company relative to the investment performance of
other similar funds.  After  consideration,  the Independent  Managers noted its
overall satisfaction with the nature, quality and extent of services

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

currently  provided to the Company by Alkeon  personnel and  concluded  that the
Company  would be likely to continue  to receive  similar  services  from Alkeon
under the Sub-Advisory Agreement.

With respect to the fees payable under the Sub-Advisory  Agreement, it was noted
that,  although  the Company  itself  would not pay any fee to Alkeon  under the
Sub-Advisory  Agreement,  the Company  would bear the  additional  advisory  fee
pursuant to the New Advisory  Agreement  (out of which the fee payable to Alkeon
under the  Sub-Advisory  Agreement would be paid) if the New Advisory  Agreement
and the Sub-Advisory  Agreement are each approved by Members. The Board compared
the proposed fees and  anticipated  overall  expense level of the Company to the
fees and expenses of other funds with similar investment programs, including but
not limited to other funds advised by  Oppenheimer  affiliates and by Alkeon (or
an Alkeon  affiliate),  and noted  that,  if the  proposed  changes  in fees are
implemented  (including  the new advisory fee and the fee payable  under the New
Services  Agreement  that the Company will pay for  administrative  and investor
services), the Company would continue to have overall fees and expenses that are
within the range of those of other similar  registered  funds.  The  Independent
Managers  also noted that the proposed fee  structure for the Company is similar
to that of other Alkeon-affiliated funds, including another registered fund with
an  investment  program  similar to that of the  Company and a number of private
investment  funds,  and it  determined  that  it is  appropriate  that  the  fee
structure  of  the  Company  allow  Alkeon  to  receive   compensation  that  is
commensurate  with the  services it provides and thus help assure that Alkeon is
willing to  continue  to commit an  appropriate  level of its  resources  to the
Company and to continue its relationship with the Company.

Consideration  was also given by the  Independent  Managers  to the  anticipated
costs of the  services  to be provided  by Alkeon  pursuant to the  Sub-Advisory
Agreement  and an estimate  of the profits  likely to be realized by Alkeon from
its relationship with the Company  (including the fee it would be paid under the
Sub-Advisory   Agreement   and  the  share  of  the   anticipated   revenues  of
Multi-Manager  and AAM that  Alkeon  would be entitled to receive as a member of
Multi-Manager  and  AAM).  The  extent to which  economies  of scale in costs of
providing  services would be realized by Alkeon as the Company grows and whether
the fee  payable  to Alkeon  pursuant  to the  Sub-Advisory  Agreement  properly
reflects  these  economies  of  scale  for the  benefit  of  Members  were  also
considered.  As with  respect to the fees  payable by the Company  under the New
Advisory Agreement, the Company's Independent Managers determined that, although
there is no reduction in compensation  that would occur as the Company's  assets
increase,  in light of the nature,  quality and scope of services proposed to be
provided by Alkeon, the anticipated costs of those services and the fees paid by
similar  funds,   the  estimated   profitability  of  Alkeon  would  not  be  so
disproportionately  large that it would bear no reasonable  relationship  to the
services that it will provide.

The Independent  Managers also considered the potential  indirect  benefits that
might  be  realized  by  Alkeon  from its  relationship  with  the  Company  and
considered possible alternatives to approval of the Sub-Advisory  Agreement.  In
this  regard,  the  Independent   Managers  evaluated  the  potential  benefits,
detriments  and costs to the  Company  and Members of  retaining  an  investment
adviser other than Alkeon to serve as sub-adviser and determined that Alkeon has
the  requisite  expertise,  personnel and resources to enable it to provide high
quality services to the Company.

After  consideration,  the Independent  Managers noted its overall  satisfaction
with the nature, quality and extent of services currently provided by OAM as the
managing  member of AAM and by Alkeon and  concluded  that the Company  would be
likely to continue to receive similar services under the New Advisory  Agreement
with Multi-Manager and under the Sub-Advisory Agreement with Alkeon.

Based on the considerations described above, the Board determined to approve the
New  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Sub-Advisory  Agreement  and the New
Services  Agreement  subject to the  approval by a majority of the Members  with
respect to the New Advisory Agreement and the Sub-Advisory  Agreement,  based on
the following, among other things: (i) the Company has had very strong long-term
performance;  (ii) the  Company's  investment  program  has become  increasingly
complex;  (iii) the Company currently pays advisory and administrative fees that
are below the fees paid by other similar funds,  including similar funds managed
by Oppenheimer affiliates and Alkeon, for advisory and administrative  services;
(iv) the new advisory fee will allow Oppenheimer to better compensate Alkeon for
its  provision  of  investment  services  to the  Company;  and (v)  that if the
proposed fee  increases are  implemented,  the Company will continue to pay fees
that are within the range of or lower than the fees being paid by other  similar
funds, including other funds managed by Alkeon.

The New Investment  Advisory  Agreement and the New Sub-Advisory  Agreement were
approved  by Members at a meeting  of Members  held on June 30,  2011 and became
effective on July 1, 2011.
