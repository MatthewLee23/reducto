            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Partners
The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P.:

     We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities, and
partners' capital of The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P. (the Fund) as of
December 31, 2005, and the related statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2005, the statements of changes in partners' capital, cash flows,
and financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2005 and for the period
March 10, 2004 (inception) through December 31, 2004. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Endowment Registered Fund, L.P. as of December 31, 2005, the results of its
operations for the year ended December 31, 2005, the changes in partners'
capital, cash flows, and financial highlights for the year ended December 31,
2005 and for the period March 10, 2004 (inception) through December 31, 2004 in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               DECEMBER 31, 2005

(1)  ORGANIZATION

     The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P. (the "Fund"), is a limited partnership
organized under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Fund was registered and
began operations on March 10, 2004 ("Inception") as a nondiversified, closed-end
management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the
"1940 Act"). The Fund was created to serve as a feeder fund for The Endowment
Master Fund, L.P. (the "Master Fund"). For convenience, reference to the Fund
may include the Master Fund, as the context requires.

     The Fund's investment objective is to preserve capital and to generate
consistent long-term appreciation and returns across all market cycles. The Fund
pursues its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in
the Master Fund, which invests its assets in a variety of investment vehicles
including but not limited to limited partnerships and limited liability
companies (collectively, the "Investment Funds"), registered investment
companies and direct investments in marketable securities and derivative
instruments. The Master Fund is a "fund of funds" and is intended to afford
investors the ability to invest in a multi-manager portfolio, exhibiting a
variety of investment styles and philosophies, in an attempt to achieve positive
risk- adjusted returns over an extended period of time. The Fund's investments
are managed by a select group of investment managers identified by the Adviser,
as hereinafter defined, to have investments that when grouped with other
investments of the Fund result in a portfolio that is allocated more broadly
across markets, asset classes, and risk profiles. The financial statements and
notes of the Master Fund, including the schedule of investments, are an integral
part of these financial statements, are included elsewhere in this report and
should be read in conjunction with the Fund's financial statements. The
percentage of the Master Fund's partnership interests owned by the Fund on
December 31, 2005 was 16.06%.

     The Endowment Fund GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, serves as the
general partner of the Fund (the "General Partner"). To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the General Partner has irrevocably delegated to a
board of directors (the "Board" and each member a "Director") its rights and
powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Fund, including the
complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the
management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business. A majority of the
members of the Board are independent of the General Partner and its management.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any of its
rights, powers and authority to, among others, the officers of the Fund, the
Adviser, or any committee of the Board.

     The Board is authorized to engage an investment adviser and it has selected
Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the "Adviser"), to manage the Fund's portfolio and
operations, pursuant to an investment management agreement (the "Investment
Management Agreement"). The Adviser is a Delaware limited partnership that is
registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(the "Advisers Act"). Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser is
responsible for the establishment of an investment committee (the "Investment
Committee"), which is responsible for developing, implementing, and supervising
the Fund's investment program subject to the ultimate supervision of the Board.
In addition to investment advisory services, the Adviser also functions as the
servicing agent of the Fund (the "Servicing Agent") and as such provides or
procures investor services and administrative assistance for the Fund. The
Adviser can delegate all or a portion of its duties as Servicing Agent to other
parties, who would in turn act as sub-servicing agents.

                            (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 2005 -- (CONTINUED)

(2)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES

  (a)  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

     The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the accrual
basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

  (b)  CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The Fund considers all unpledged temporary cash investments with a maturity
date at the time of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

  (c)  INVESTMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     The Fund records security transactions on a trade-date basis.

     Securities owned or sold, not yet purchased, are marked to estimated fair
value at the date of the financial statements, and the corresponding unrealized
gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.

     Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are accounted
for based on the first in first out ("FIFO") method.

     Distributions received from investments, whether in the form of cash or
securities, are applied as a reduction of the cost of the investment.

  (d)  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

     The valuation of the Fund's investments will be determined as of the close
of business at the end of any fiscal period, generally monthly. The valuation of
the Fund's investments is generally calculated by BISYS Fund Services Ohio, Inc.
("BISYS"), the Fund's independent administrator (the "Independent
Administrator") in consultation with the Adviser. The valuation procedures of
the Fund's underlying investments are reviewed by a committee approved by the
Board that was established to oversee the valuation of the Fund's investments
(the "Valuation Committee"), in consultation with the Adviser and the
Independent Administrator. The net assets of the Fund will equal the value of
the total assets of the Fund, less all of its liabilities, including accrued
fees and expenses.

     The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund.
Investments in the Master Fund are accounted for using the equity method, which
approximates fair value. Valuation of the investments held by the Master Fund is
discussed in the notes to the Master Fund financial statements included
elsewhere in this report.

  (e)  INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is
recorded as earned on the accrual basis.

  (f)  FUND EXPENSES

     Unless otherwise voluntarily or contractually assumed by the Adviser or
another party, the Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, directly or
indirectly through its investment in the Master Fund, including but not limited
to, the following: all costs and expenses related to investment transactions and
positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting, auditing and tax
preparation fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; certain offering costs; expenses of
meetings of

                      THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                            (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 2005 -- (CONTINUED)

the partners; directors fees; all costs with respect to communications to
partners; and other types of expenses as may be approved from time to time by
the General Partner. Offering costs are amortized over a twelve-month period or
less from the date they are incurred.

  (g)  INCOME TAXES

     The Fund is not subject to federal, state, or local income taxes because
such taxes are the responsibility of the individual partners in the Fund.
Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made in the Fund's financial
statements.

  (h)  USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  (i)  ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES

     The Fund's organizational expenses (the "Organizational Expenses") were
initially borne by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof and for capital account
allocation purposes assumed to be reimbursed, over not more than a 60 month
period of time, notwithstanding that such Organizational Expenses were expensed
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for Fund
reporting purposes upon commencement of operations.

  (j)  RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2004 financial statements
to conform them with the 2005 presentation.

(3)  PARTNERS' CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

  (a)  ISSUANCE OF INTERESTS

     Upon receipt from an eligible investor of an application for interests (the
"Interests"), which will generally be accepted as of the first day of each
month, the Fund will issue new Interests. The Interests have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the
securities laws of any state. The Fund issues Interests only in private
placement transactions in accordance with Regulation D or other applicable
exemptions under the Securities Act. No public market exists for the Interests,
and none is expected to develop. The Fund is not required, and does not intend,
to hold annual meetings of its partners. The Interests are subject to
substantial restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be
transferred or resold except as permitted under the Fund's limited partnership
agreement (the "LP Agreement"). The Fund reserves the right to reject any
applications for Interests. The $765,000 in subscriptions received in advance as
of December 31, 2005 represents subscriptions for Fund Interests received prior
to the January 2006 closing.

  (b)  ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

     For each fiscal period, generally monthly, net profits or net losses of the
Fund, including allocations from the Master Fund, are allocated among and
credited to or debited against the capital accounts of all partners as
                                        7
<PAGE>
                      THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                            (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 2005 -- (CONTINUED)

of the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with the partners'
respective investment ownership percentages for the fiscal period. Net profits
or net losses are measured as the net change in the value of the net assets of
the Fund, including any net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of
investments and income, net of expenses, and realized gains or losses during a
fiscal period. Net profits or net losses are allocated after giving effect for
any repurchases of Interests or initial or additional applications for
Interests, which generally occur at the beginning of the month.

  (c)  REDEMPTION OF INTERESTS

     A partner will not be eligible to have the Fund repurchase all or any
portion of an Interest at any time prior to the business day immediately
preceding the one-year anniversary of the partner's purchase of such Interest
(or portion thereof) without incurring additional costs including an early
repurchase fee. The Adviser, which also serves as the investment adviser of the
Master Fund, expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to
repurchase such Interests each calendar quarter, pursuant to written tenders by
partners. However, the Board retains the sole discretion to accept or reject the
recommendation of the Adviser and to determine the amount of Interests, if any,
that will be purchased in any tender offer that it does approve. Since the
Fund's assets are invested in the Master Fund, the ability of the Fund to redeem
its Interests in the Master Fund would be subject to the Master Fund's
repurchase policy. In addition, the Fund may determine not to conduct a
repurchase offer each time the Master Fund conducts a repurchase offer. In the
event Interests are redeemed, there will be a substantial period of time between
the date as of which partners must tender their Interests for repurchase and the
date they can expect to receive payment for their Interests from the Fund.

(4)  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

     As of December 31, 2005, all of the investments made by the Fund were in
the Master Fund.

(5)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
may invest either directly or through the Master Fund will trade various
derivative securities and other financial instruments, and enter into various
investment activities with off-balance sheet risk both as an investor and as a
principal. The Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the
Fund's pro-rata share of the value of the investment in such Investment Funds as
held by the Master Fund. In addition, the Master Fund may from time to time
invest in derivative securities or other financial instruments to gain greater
or lesser exposure to a particular asset class.

(6)  ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT

     In consideration for administrative, accounting, and recordkeeping
services, the Master Fund will pay the Independent Administrator a monthly
administration fee (the "Administration Fee") based on the month end net assets
of the Master Fund. The Master Fund is charged, on an annual basis, 8 basis
points on Master Fund net assets of up to $100 million, 7 basis points on Master
Fund net assets between the amounts of $100 million and $250 million and 6 basis
points for amounts over $250 million. The asset based fees are assessed based on
month end net assets and are payable in arrears. The Independent Administrator
will also provide the Master Fund with legal, compliance, transfer agency, and
other investor related services at an additional cost.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 2005 -- (CONTINUED)

(7)  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

  (a)  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE

     In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by the Adviser
to the Master Fund, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Master
Fund will pay the Adviser an investment management fee (the "Investment
Management Fee"), equal to 1% on an annualized basis of the Master Fund's net
assets, calculated based on the NAV at the end of each month, payable quarterly
in arrears. So long as the Fund invests all of its investable assets in the
Master Fund, the Fund will not pay the Adviser directly any Investment
Management Fee; however, the Fund's partners bear an indirect portion of the
Investment Management Fee paid by the Master Fund. The Investment Management Fee
will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the Master Fund and
indirectly the Fund as the fees reduce the capital accounts of the Master Fund's
limited partners.

  (b)  SERVICING FEE

     In consideration for providing or procuring investor services and
administrative assistance to the Fund, the Adviser will receive a servicing fee
(the "Servicing Fee") equal to 1% (on an annualized basis) of each partner's
capital account balance, calculated at the end of each month, payable quarterly
in arrears.

     The Adviser chose to waive the Servicing Fee since Inception of the Fund
until such time as the collective net asset value of all 1940 Act feeders
investing in the Master Fund exceeded $40 million and the initial offering costs
of the Fund had been fully amortized. As of June 30, 2005 the Fund's net asset
value exceeded $40 million and all offering costs had been amortized. Therefore,
beginning July 1, 2005 the Fund eliminated the Servicing Fee waiver. For the
year ended December 31, 2005, $479,793 of Servicing Fees were charged by the
Adviser, of which $203,276 were waived by the Adviser.

  (c)  PLACEMENT AGENTS

     The Fund may engage one or more placement agents (each, a "Placement
Agent") to solicit investments in the Fund. Sanders Morris Harris, Inc. ("SMH"),
an affiliate of the General Partner and the Adviser, has been engaged by the
Master Fund to serve as a Placement Agent. SMH is a full service investment
banking, broker-dealer, asset management and financial services organization. A
Placement Agent may engage one or more sub-placement agents. The Adviser or its
affiliates may pay a fee out of their own resources to Placement Agents and
sub-placement agents.

(8)  INDEBTEDNESS OF THE FUND

     Pursuant to the Fund LP Agreement, the Fund may borrow up to, but not more
than, 10% of the net assets of the Fund (at the time such borrowings were made
and after taking into account the investment and/or deployment of such proceeds)
for the purpose of making investments, funding redemptions and for other working
capital and general Fund purposes. For purposes of the Fund's investment
restrictions and certain investment limitations under the 1940 Act, including
for example, the Fund's leverage limitations, the Fund will not "look through"
Investment Funds in which the Fund invests. Investment Funds may also use
leverage, whether through borrowings, futures, or other derivative products and
are not subject to the Fund's investment restrictions. However, such borrowings
by Investment Funds are without recourse to the Fund and the Fund's risk of loss
is limited to its pro rata share of such Investment Funds (held through its
investment in the Master Fund). The rights of any lenders to the Fund to receive
payments of interest or repayments of principal will be senior to those of the
partners, and the terms of any borrowings may contain provisions that limit
certain activities of the Fund.

     The above calculations reflect the waiver of the Servicing Fees since
Inception of the Fund through June 30, 2005. An investor's return (and operating
ratios) may vary from those reflected based on the timing of capital
transactions.
- ---------------

(1) Ratios are calculated by dividing by average partners' capital measured at
    the end of each month during the period. Ratios include allocations of net
    investment loss and expenses from the Master Fund. These ratios have been
    annualized for 2004.

(2) Had the Servicing Fee waiver not been in effect, the ratios for net
    investment loss to average partners' capital would have been (1.73)% and
    (4.42)% for 2005 and 2004 (annualized), respectively. Without the Servicing
    Fee waiver, the ratios for expenses to average partners' capital would have
    been 2.59% and 5.14% for 2005 and 2004 (annualized), respectively.

(3) The Fund is invested exclusively in the Master Fund, therefore this ratio
    reflects the portfolio turnover of the Master Fund, which is for a full
    year.

(4) Calculated as geometrically linked monthly returns for each month in the
    period.

(10)  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

     The Adviser recommended to the Board that a tender offer in an amount of up
to $5,000,000 be made, based on the projected March 31, 2006 net asset value of
the Fund, to those partners who elect to tender their Interests prior to the
expiration of the tender offer period. The Board approved such recommendation
and a tender offer notice expiring February 28, 2006 was sent out to the
investors in the Fund.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Partners
The Endowment Master Fund, L.P.:

     We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities, and
partners' capital of The Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (the Fund), including the
schedule of investments, as of December 31, 2005, and the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in partners'
capital and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period then ended,
and the financial highlights for each of the years in the two year period ended
December 31, 2005 and for the period April 1, 2003 (inception) through December
31, 2003. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2005, by correspondence with
custodians and investees. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Endowment Master Fund, L.P. as of December 31, 2005, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its partners' capital and
cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the financial
highlights for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 and for the period
April 1, 2003 (inception) through December 31, 2003, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

                        THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                            (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               DECEMBER 31, 2005

(1)  ORGANIZATION

     The Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (the "Fund") is a limited partnership
organized under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Fund began operations in
April 2003 ("Inception"). The Fund operated as an unregistered investment
vehicle until March 10, 2004, at which time it registered as a nondiversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"). The Fund is the master fund in a master-feeder structure
in which there are currently six feeder funds.

     The Fund's investment objective is to preserve capital and to generate
consistent long-term appreciation and returns across all market cycles. The Fund
pursues its investment objective by investing its assets in a variety of
investment vehicles including but not limited to limited partnerships and
limited liability companies (collectively, the "Investment Funds"), registered
investment companies and direct investments in marketable securities and
derivative instruments. The Fund is a "fund of funds" and is intended to afford
investors the ability to invest in a multi-manager portfolio, exhibiting a
variety of investment styles and philosophies, in an attempt to achieve positive
risk-adjusted returns over an extended period of time. The Fund's investments
are managed by a select group of investment managers identified by the Adviser,
as hereinafter defined, to have investments that when grouped with other
investments of the Fund result in a portfolio that is allocated more broadly
across markets, asset classes, and risk profiles.

     The Endowment Fund GP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, serves as the
general partner of the Fund (the "General Partner"). To the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, the General Partner has irrevocably delegated to a
board of directors (the "Board" and each member a "Director") its rights and
powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Fund, including the
complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the
management, conduct, and operation of the Fund's business. A majority of the
members of the Board are independent of the General Partner and its management.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Board may delegate any of its
rights, powers and authority to, among others, the officers of the Fund, the
Adviser, or any committee of the Board.

     The Board is authorized to engage an investment adviser and it has selected
Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the "Adviser"), to manage the Fund's portfolio and
operations, pursuant to an investment management agreement (the "Investment
Management Agreement"). The Adviser is a Delaware limited partnership that is
registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(the "Advisers Act"). Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser is
responsible for the establishment of an investment committee (the "Investment
Committee"), which is responsible for developing, implementing, and supervising
the Fund's investment program subject to the ultimate supervision of the Board.

(2)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES

  (a)  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING

     The accompanying financial statements have been presented on the accrual
basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

  (b)  CASH EQUIVALENTS

     The Fund considers all unpledged temporary cash investments with a maturity
date at the time of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

                                        12

                        THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                            (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 2005 -- (CONTINUED)

  (c)  INVESTMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     The Fund records security transactions on a trade-date basis.

     Securities owned or sold, not yet purchased, are marked to estimated fair
value at the date of the financial statements, and the corresponding unrealized
gain or loss is included in the statement of operations.

     Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are accounted
for based on the first in first out ("FIFO") method.

     Distributions received from Investment Funds, whether in the form of cash
or securities, are applied as a reduction of the cost of the investment.

  (d)  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

     The valuation of the Fund's investments will be determined as of the close
of business at the end of any fiscal period, generally monthly. The valuation of
the Fund's investments is generally calculated by BISYS Fund Services Ohio, Inc.
("BISYS"), the Fund's independent administrator (the "Independent
Administrator") in consultation with the Adviser. The valuation procedures of
the Fund's underlying investments are reviewed by a committee approved by the
Board that was established to oversee the valuation of the Fund's investments
(the "Valuation Committee"), in consultation with the Adviser and the
Independent Administrator. The net assets of the Fund will equal the value of
the total assets of the Fund, less all of its liabilities, including accrued
fees and expenses.

     Investments are valued as follows:

     - INVESTMENT FUNDS -- Investments in Investment Funds are ordinarily valued
       at the valuations provided to the Independent Administrator by the
       investment managers of such Investment Funds or the administrators of
       those Investment Funds. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
       subject to the terms and conditions of the respective operating
       agreements and offering memoranda, as appropriate. The Fund's investments
       in Investment Funds are carried at estimated fair value as determined by
       the Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of each Investment Fund.
       Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, this estimated fair
       value may differ from the value that would have been used had a ready
       market for the investments in Investment Funds existed. These Investment
       Funds value their underlying investments in accordance with policies
       established by such Investment Funds. All valuations utilize financial
       information supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management
       and estimated performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the
       Investment Funds' managers pursuant to the Investment Funds' agreements.

     - SECURITIES LISTED ON A SECURITIES EXCHANGE -- In general, the Fund values
       listed securities at their last sales price as of the last business day
       of the applicable period. If no sales occurred on that date, the
       securities are valued at the mean between the "bid" and "asked" prices at
       the close of trading on that date.

     - SECURITIES LISTED ON OVER-THE-COUNTER EXCHANGES -- Securities listed on
       over-the-counter exchanges are valued at the last reported sales price on
       the date of determination, if available, through the facilities of a
       recognized interdealer quotation system (such as securities in the NASDAQ
       National Market List) or at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. If the
       last reported sales price is not available, the securities are valued at
       the mean between the "bid" and "asked" prices at the close of trading on
       that date.

                        THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                            (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 2005 -- (CONTINUED)

     - OPTIONS -- Options that are listed on a securities exchange or traded
       over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the closing "bid" and
       "asked" prices for such options on the date of determination.

     - SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED -- The value of securities, derivatives or
       synthetic securities that are not actively traded on an exchange shall be
       determined by obtaining indicative quotes from brokers that normally deal
       in such securities or by an unaffiliated pricing service that may use
       actual trade data or procedures using market indices, matrices, yield
       curves, specific trading characteristics of certain groups of securities,
       pricing models or a combination of these procedures.

     - OTHER -- Where no value is readily available from an Investment Fund or
       other security or where a value supplied by an Investment Fund is deemed
       not to be indicative of the Investment Fund's value, the Valuation
       Committee and/or the Board, in consultation with the Independent
       Administrator or the Adviser will determine, in good faith, the estimated
       fair value of the Investment Fund or security.

  (e)  INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is
recorded as earned on the accrual basis.

  (f)  FUND EXPENSES

     Unless voluntarily or contractually assumed by the Adviser or another
party, the Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not
limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to investment
transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting,
auditing and tax preparation fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's
net asset value; costs of insurance; registration expenses; certain offering
costs; expenses of meetings of the partners; directors fees; all costs with
respect to communications to partners; and other types of expenses as may be
approved from time to time by the General Partner. Offering costs are amortized
over a twelve-month period or less from the date they are incurred.

  (g)  INCOME TAXES

     The Fund itself is not subject to federal, state, or local income taxes
because such taxes are the responsibility of the individual partners in the
Fund. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made in the Fund's
financial statements other than withholding tax on dividend income that is
allocated to the Fund's offshore feeders.

  (h)  USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  (i)  ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES

     The Fund's organizational expenses (the "Organizational Expenses") were
initially borne by the Adviser or an affiliate thereof and for capital account
allocation purposes assumed to be reimbursed, over not more than a 60 month
period of time, notwithstanding that such Organizational Expenses were expensed
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for Fund
reporting purposes upon commencement of operations.

                        DECEMBER 31, 2005 -- (CONTINUED)

  (j)  RECLASSIFICATIONS

     Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2004 financial statements
to conform them with the 2005 presentation.

(3)  PARTNERS' CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

  (a)  ISSUANCE OF INTERESTS

     Upon receipt from an eligible investor of an application for interests (the
"Interests"), which will generally be accepted as of the first day of each
month, the Fund will issue new Interests. The Interests have not been registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the
securities laws of any state. The Fund issues Interests only in private
placement transactions in accordance with Regulation D or other applicable
exemptions under the Securities Act. No public market exists for the Interests,
and none is expected to develop. The Fund is not required, and does not intend,
to hold annual meetings of its partners. The Interests are subject to
substantial restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be
transferred or resold except as permitted under the Fund's limited partnership
agreement (the "LP Agreement"). The Fund reserves the right to reject any
applications for subscription of Interests.

  (b)  ALLOCATION OF PROFITS AND LOSSES

     For each fiscal period, generally monthly, net profits or net losses of the
Fund are allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
of all partners as of the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with the
partners' respective investment ownership percentages for the fiscal period. Net
profits or net losses are measured as the net change in the value of the net
assets of the Fund, including any net change in unrealized appreciation or
depreciation of investments and income, net of expenses, and realized gains or
losses during a fiscal period. Net profits or net losses are allocated after
giving effect for any repurchases of Interests or initial or additional
applications for Interests, which generally occur at the beginning of the month.

  (c)  REDEMPTION OF INTERESTS

     A partner will not be eligible to have the Fund repurchase all or any
portion of an Interest at the partner's discretion at any time. However, the
Adviser expects that it will recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to
repurchase Interests each calendar quarter, pursuant to written tenders by
partners. The Board retains the sole discretion to accept or reject the
recommendation of the Adviser and to determine the amount, if any, that will be
purchased in any tender offer that it does approve. In the event Interests are
repurchased, there will be a substantial period of time between the date as of
which partners must accept the Fund's offer to repurchase their Interests and
the date they can expect to receive payment for their Interests from the Fund.

(4)  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

     As of December 31, 2005, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds,
registered investment companies and marketable securities in a separately
managed account, which is managed by a sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser"). The
$15,100,000 in prepaid contribution to Investment Funds as of December 31, 2005
represents funding of a portion of the January 2006 investment in such funds.
The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for
compensation to the Investment Funds' managers/general partners or advisors in
the form of management fees ranging from 0.25% to 2.5% of net assets annually.
In addition, many Investment Funds also provide for performance incentive
fees/allocations ranging from 15% to 25% of an Investment Fund's net profits,
although it is possible that such ranges may be exceeded for certain

                                        15
<PAGE>
                        THE ENDOWMENT MASTER FUND, L.P.
                            (A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP)

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 2005 -- (CONTINUED)

investment managers. These fees and incentive fees are in addition to the
management fees charged by the Fund.

     In general, most of the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests, other
than Investment Funds investing primarily in private equity, energy and real
estate transactions, provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to
annually with lock up provisions usually for a period of up to four years.
Investment Funds that do provide for periodic redemptions may, depending on the
Investment Fund's governing documents, have the ability to deny or delay a
redemption request. Amounts representing redemption requests of underlying
Investment Funds for which the redemption has not been processed as of year end
are included in the category Investments in Investment Funds. For the year ended
December 31, 2005, the aggregate cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of
investments were $104,090,555 and $43,304,376 respectively.

     The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from its investments. The
allocated taxable income is reported to the Fund by its investments on Schedules
K-1 or 1099's. As of December 31, 2005, the cost of the Fund's investments was
$309,978,618. Accordingly, unrealized appreciation and depreciation on
investments was $66,601,242 and $1,278,624 respectively.

(5)  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
invests trade various derivative securities and other financial instruments, and
enter into various investment activities with off-balance sheet risk both as an
investor and as a principal. The Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds
is limited to the value of the investment in such Investment Funds as reported
by the Fund. In addition, the Fund may from time to time invest in derivative
securities or other financial instruments to gain greater or lesser exposure to
a particular asset class.

(6)  DUE FROM BROKERS

     The Fund conducts business with various brokers for its investment
activities. The clearing and depository operations for the investment activities
are performed pursuant to agreements with the brokers. The Fund is subject to
credit risk to the extent any broker with whom the Fund conducts business is
unable to deliver cash balances or securities, or clear security transactions on
the Fund's behalf. The Fund monitors the financial condition of the brokers with
which the Fund conducts business and believes the likelihood of loss under the
aforementioned circumstances is remote.

(7)  ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT

     In consideration for administrative, accounting, and recordkeeping
services, the Fund will pay the Independent Administrator a monthly
administration fee (the "Administration Fee") based on the month end net assets
of the Fund. The Fund is charged, on an annual basis, 8 basis points on Fund net
assets of up to $100 million, 7 basis points on Fund net assets between the
amounts of $100 million and $250 million and 6 basis points for amounts over
$250 million. The asset based fees are assessed based on month end net assets
and are payable in arrears. The Independent Administrator will also provide the
Fund with legal, compliance, transfer agency, and other investor related
services at an additional cost.

     The fees for Fund administration will be paid out of the Fund's assets,
which will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the partners
in the Fund. As of December 31, 2005, the Fund had $376,169,059 in net assets.
The total administration fee incurred for the year ended December 31, 2005 was
$230,201.

  (a)  INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE

     In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by the Adviser
to the Fund pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement, the Fund will pay
the Adviser an investment management fee (the "Investment Management Fee"),
equal to 1% on an annualized basis of the Fund's net assets calculated based on
the Fund's net asset value at the end of each month, payable quarterly in
arrears. The Investment Management Fee will decrease the net profits or increase
the net losses of the Fund that are credited to or debited against the capital
accounts of its limited partners. For the year ended December 31, 2005,
$3,336,051 was incurred for Investment Management Fees.

  (b)  PLACEMENT AGENTS

     The Fund may engage one or more placement agents (each, a "Placement
Agent") to solicit investments in the Fund. Sanders Morris Harris, Inc. ("SMH"),
an affiliate of the General Partner and the Adviser, has been engaged by the
Fund to serve as a Placement Agent. SMH is a full-service investment banking,
broker-dealer, asset management and financial services organization. A Placement
Agent may engage one or more sub-placement agents. The Adviser or its affiliates
may pay a fee out of their own resources to Placement Agents and sub-placement
agents.

(9)  INDEBTEDNESS OF THE FUND

     Pursuant to the Fund LP Agreement, the Fund may borrow up to, but not more
than, 10% of net assets of the Fund (at the time such borrowings were made and
after taking into account the investment and/or deployment of such proceeds) for
the purpose of making investments, funding redemptions and for other working
capital and general Fund purposes. For purposes of the Fund's investment
restrictions and certain investment limitations under the 1940 Act, including
for example, the Fund's leverage limitations, the Fund will not "look through"
Investment Funds in which the Fund invests. Investment Funds may also use
leverage, whether through borrowings, futures, or other derivative products and
are not subject to the Fund's investment restrictions. However, such borrowings
by Investment Funds are without recourse to the Fund and the Fund's risk of loss
is limited to its investment in such Investment Funds. The rights of any lenders
to the Fund to receive payments of interest or repayments of principal will be
senior to those of the partners, and the terms of any borrowings may contain
provisions that limit certain activities of the Fund.

     The Fund maintains a credit facility for which the investments of the Fund
serve as collateral for the facility. The maximum amount that can be borrowed is
based on the value of the underlying collateral; provided, however, that the
Fund's fundamental policies provide that the Fund cannot borrow more than 10% of
the value of the Fund's net assets. As of December 31, 2005, $14,390,426 was
outstanding under the credit facility at a current interest rate of 6.89%. The
weighted average interest rate paid on the line of credit during the year was
6.19%.

(11)  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

     The Adviser recommended to the Board that a tender offer in an amount of up
to $12,000,000 be made, based on the projected March 31, 2006 net asset value of
the Fund, to those partners who elect to tender their Interests prior to the
expiration of the tender offer period. The Board approved such recommendation
and a tender offer notice expiring February 28, 2006 was sent out to the
investors in the Fund.

Endowment TEI Fund, L.P. (the "TEI Fund") and The Endowment Registered Fund,
L.P. (the "Registered Fund") are registered investment companies (collectively,
the "Fund Complex" and each individually the "Fund"). The members of the
Investment Committee (each an "Investment Committee Member") are: Messrs. John
A. Blaisdell, Andrew B. Linbeck, A. Haag Sherman and Mark W. Yusko.

     Mr. Blaisdell has served as an Investment Committee Member since January
2004 and Managing Director of Salient Partners, L.P. ("Salient") since December

Ventures, L.P. (from 1997-2002). Mr. Linbeck has served as an Investment
Committee Member since January 2004 and Managing Director of Salient since
August 2002. Previously, he held the position of Partner and executive officer

asset allocation recommendations by the Adviser's staff, manager due diligence
and recommendations and, by a majority vote of the Investment Committee,
determines asset allocation and manager selection.

     The Adviser and certain other entities controlled by the Principals manage
investment programs which are similar to that of the Fund, and the Adviser
and/or the Principals may in the future serve as an investment adviser or

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF THE ADVISER

     From time to time, potential conflicts of interest may arise between an
Investment Committee Member's management of the investments of the Fund, on the
one hand, and the management of other registered investment companies, pooled
investment vehicles and other accounts (collectively, "other accounts"), on the
other. The other accounts might have similar investment objectives or strategies
as the Fund, track the same index the Fund tracks or otherwise hold, purchase,
or sell securities that are eligible to be held,

<PAGE>

purchased or sold by the Fund. The other accounts might also have different
investment objectives or strategies than the Fund.

     Knowledge and Timing of Fund Trades. A potential conflict of interest may
arise as a result of the Investment Committee Member's day-to-day management of
a Fund. Because of their positions with the Fund, the Investment Committee
Members know the size, timing and possible market impact of the Fund's trades.
It is theoretically possible that the Investment Committee Members could use
this information to the advantage of other accounts they manage and to the
possible detriment of the Fund.

     Investment Opportunities. A potential conflict of interest may arise as a
result of the Investment Committee Member's management of a number of accounts
with varying investment guidelines. Often, an investment opportunity may be
suitable for both the Fund and other accounts managed by the Investment
Committee Member, but may not be available in sufficient quantities for both the
Fund and the other accounts to participate fully. Similarly, there may be
limited opportunity to sell an investment held by the Fund and other accounts.
The Adviser has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate
investment opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time.

     Performance Fees. An Investment Committee Member may advise certain
accounts with respect to which the advisory fee is based entirely or partially
on performance. Performance fee arrangements may create a conflict of interest
for the Investment Committee Member in that the Member may have an incentive to
allocate the investment opportunities that he or she believes might be the most
profitable to such other accounts instead of allocating them to the Fund.

COMPENSATION TO INVESTMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS

     Messrs. Blaisdell, Linbeck, Sherman and Yusko own equity interests in the
Adviser. As it relates to the Fund and other funds within the Fund Complex,
Messrs. Blaisdell, Linbeck, Sherman and Yusko receive all of their compensation
based on the size of the Fund and the other funds within the Fund Complex and
the management and advisory fees charged thereon. Accordingly, they believe that
a significant driver of their compensation is the performance of the Fund and
the Fund Complex, which has a significant bearing on the ability to raise
additional assets. Messrs. Blaisdell, Linbeck, Sherman and Yusko also own equity
in the general partner of another fund, and are compensated directly on
performance (based on an incentive allocation) and the size of the fund's asset
base. In addition, Messrs. Blaisdell, Linbeck and Sherman are partners and
principal executive officers of Salient and related affiliates and subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Salient Group"), which pays them a base salary (but no
bonus) and is obligated to make distributions of profits to them, as well as the
other partners, on an annual basis. These individuals are responsible for the
investment processes and management of the Salient Group. Messrs. Blaisdell,
Linbeck and Sherman believe that to the extent that they are successful in their
investment endeavors, the greater the number of assets over time and the more
significant their compensation from the Salient Group.

     Mr. Yusko is a partner of Morgan Creek Capital Management, which pays him a
base salary and is anticipated to make distributions of profits above and beyond
that which is necessary to operate the business. Mr. Yusko is chiefly
responsible for the

<PAGE>

investment processes and management of Morgan Creek Capital Management. He
believes that to the extent that he and the staff at Morgan Creek Capital
Management are successful in their investment endeavors, the greater the number
of assets over time and the more significant their compensation.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION

     Mr. Adam L. Thomas has significant day-to-day duties in the management of
the portfolio of the Fund, including providing analysis and recommendations on
Asset Allocation and Investment Fund selection to the Investment Committee. Mr.
Thomas owns equity interests in the Adviser. In addition, Mr. Thomas receives an
additional interest in a portion of the revenues of the Adviser. As it relates
to the Fund and other funds within the Fund Complex, Mr. Thomas receives all of
his compensation based on the size of the Fund and the other funds within the
Fund Complex and the management and advisory fees charged thereon. Accordingly,
he believes that a significant driver of his compensation is the performance of
the Fund and the Fund Complex, which has a significant bearing on the ability to
raise additional assets. Mr. Thomas also owns equity in the general partner of
another fund (and Mr. Thomas also owns a interest in a portion of the revenues
derived by such general partner), and is compensated directly on performance
(based on an incentive allocation) and the size of the fund's asset base (as of
December 31, 2005, this fund's asset base was approximately $74 million). In
addition, Mr. Thomas is a partner and officer of entities within the Salient
Group, which pay him a base salary and he may receive a bonus, and Salient is
obligated to make distributions of profits to him, as well as the other
partners, on an annual basis. Mr. Thomas believes that to the extent that he is
successful in his investment endeavors, the greater the number of assets over
time and the more significant his compensation from the Salient Group will be.

THE SUB-ADVISER

     In accordance with the Investment Management Agreement, the Adviser has
engaged Tanglewood Asset Management, LLC ("Tanglewood") as a sub-adviser (the
"Sub-Adviser") to manage portions of the Master Fund's traditional fixed income
investment portfolio. Tanglewood does not invest in Investment Funds, but rather
invests directly in debt securities and open and closed end funds.

     Tanglewood is a North Carolina limited liability company, is registered as
an investment adviser under the Advisers Act, and is located at 110 Oakwood
Drive, Suite 210, Winston-Salem, NC 27103. Tanglewood offers advisory and
portfolio management services for fixed income, equity, and balanced accounts.
Tanglewood manages a moderate duration fixed income portfolio for the Master
Fund, the fees for which are 0.25%, on an annualized basis, for the first $10
million of assets managed, 0.20% on the next $20 million, and 0.15% thereafter.

SUB-ADVISER PRINCIPALS

     Persons responsible for the day-to-day management of the portions of the
Fund's assets that are managed by Tanglewood are: Wayne Forrest Morgan, Samuel
Meador Gibbs, II, and Alfred Reiner Guenthner (each, a "Principal"). Other
Accounts Managed by the Sub-Adviser

     Certain Principals who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of certain portions of the Master Fund's assets, also manage other
registered investment companies, other pooled investment vehicles and other
accounts, as indicated below. The following tables identify, as of December 31,
2005: (i) the number of other registered investment companies, pooled investment
vehicles and other accounts managed by these Principals and the total assets of
such companies, vehicles and accounts; and (ii) the number and total assets of
such companies, vehicles and accounts with respect to which the advisory fee is

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OF THE SUB-ADVISER

     From time to time, potential conflicts of interest may arise between a
portfolio manager's management of the investments of the Master Fund, on the one
hand, and the management of other registered investment companies, pooled
investment vehicles and other accounts (collectively, "other accounts"), on the
other. The other accounts might have similar investment objectives or strategies
as the Master Fund, track the same index the Fund tracks or otherwise hold,
purchase, or sell securities that are eligible to be held, purchased or sold by
the Master Fund. The other accounts might also have different investment
objectives or strategies than the Master Fund. Tanglewood manages the
"traditional fixed income" portfolio of the Master Fund and principally invests
directly in US government and agency securities as well as US "investment grade"
corporate fixed income securities as well as open and closed end fixed income
funds. In general, the market for such securities is deep and highly liquid.
Accordingly, Tanglewood is not subject to the same conflict of interest issues
that many other Investment Managers are (e.g., market impact of trades and
allocation of investment opportunities).

     Tanglewood believes that its largest potential conflict of interest relates
to the allocation of trades and brokerage commissions to its various accounts.
Tanglewood has adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate
investment opportunities and brokerage commissions on a fair and equitable basis
over time.

     Knowledge and Timing of Master Fund Trades. A potential conflict of
interest may arise as a result of the Principal's day-to-day management of a
portion of the assets of the Master Fund. Because of their positions with the
Master Fund, the portfolio managers know the size, timing and possible market
impact of the Master Fund's trades. It is theoretically possible that the
portfolio managers could use this information to the

<PAGE>

advantage of other accounts they manage and to the possible detriment of the
Master Fund.

     Investment Opportunities. A potential conflict of interest may arise as
result of the Principal's management of a number of accounts with varying
investment guidelines. Often, an investment opportunity may be suitable for both
the Master Fund and other accounts managed by the Principal, but may not be
available in sufficient quantities for both the Master Fund and the other
accounts to participate fully. Similarly, there may be limited opportunity to
sell an investment held by the Master Fund and another account. Tanglewood has
adopted policies and procedures reasonably designed to allocate investment
opportunities on a fair and equitable basis over time.

     Performance Fees. A portfolio manager may advise certain accounts with
respect to which the advisory fee is based entirely or partially on performance.
Performance fee arrangements may create a conflict of interest for the portfolio
manager in that the portfolio manager may have an incentive to allocate the
investment opportunities that he or she believes might be the most profitable to
such other accounts instead of allocating them to the Master Fund.

                       THE ENDOWMENT REGISTERED FUND, L.P.
                          THE ENDOWMENT TEI FUND, L.P.

                           SANDERS MORRIS HARRIS, INC.

                           CODE OF ETHICS (RULE 17J-1)

I.   GENERAL

     A. Statement of Purpose

     The Endowment Registered Fund, L.P., The Endowment TEI Fund, L.P. and The
     Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (each, a "Fund," and, together, the "Funds");
     and Sanders Morris Harris, Inc., the placement agent for each Fund (the
     "Placement Agent") (the Funds and the Placement Agent are each a "Company"
     and together the "Companies") each hold their directors, general partners,
     officers, employees and service providers to a high standard of integrity
     and business practices. The Companies strive to avoid conflicts of interest
     or the appearance of conflicts of interest in connection with transactions
     in securities for the Funds.

     The Companies recognize that the knowledge of present or future portfolio
     transactions and, in certain instances, the power to influence portfolio
     transactions in securities that may be possessed by certain of their
     directors, general partners, officers and employees could place such
     individuals, if they engage in personal transactions in securities that are
     eligible for investment by a Fund, in a position where their personal
     interests may conflict with the interests of the Fund.

     In view of the foregoing and of the provisions of Rule 17j-1 under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act"),(1) each Company
     has determined to adopt this Code of Ethics ("Code") to identify and
     prohibit certain types of transactions deemed to create conflicts of
     interest (or at least the potential for or the appearance of such a
     conflict) and to establish reporting requirements and enforcement
     procedures. This document constitutes the Code required by Rule 17j-1 for
     the Companies.

     B. Statement of General Principles

     The following general principles should guide the actions of Access Persons
     (as defined below) in evaluating and engaging in personal securities
     transactions:

          1. The interests of the Funds' shareholders are paramount. Access
          Persons must conduct themselves and their operations to give maximum
          effect to this tenet by assiduously placing the interests of the
          shareholders before their own.

- ----------
(1)  Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act makes it unlawful for investment company
     personnel and other "Access Persons" to engage in "fraudulent, deceptive or
     manipulative" practices in connection with their personal transactions in
     securities when those securities are held or to be acquired by an
     investment company. The Rule also requires every investment company, the
     investment company's investment adviser, and, in certain cases, the
     investment company's placement agent to adopt a Code of Ethics containing
     provisions "reasonably necessary to prevent" such prohibited practices.


                                       1

<PAGE>

          2. All personal transactions in securities by Access Persons must be
          accomplished so as to avoid even the appearance of a conflict with the
          interests of the Funds and their shareholders.

          3. Access Persons must avoid actions or activities that allow (or
          appear to allow) a person to profit or benefit from his or her
          position with respect to the Funds, or that otherwise bring into
          question the person's independence or judgment.

     This Code does not attempt to identify all possible conflicts of interest,
     and literal compliance with each of the specific procedures will not shield
     a person from liability for personal trading or other conduct that violates
     any fiduciary duty to a Fund's shareholders. In addition to the specific
     prohibitions contained in this Code, each person covered by this Code is
     subject to a general requirement not to engage in any act or practice that
     would defraud a Fund's shareholders.

     C. Applicability of Code

     The requirements of this Code are not applicable to any Access Person of a
     Fund who is subject to a separate code of ethics adopted by the Adviser or
     a Sub-Adviser of the Fund, provided that: (1) such Code of Ethics complies
     with the requirements of Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and has been
     approved by the Fund's Board; and (2) such Adviser or Sub-Adviser has
     certified to the Board of the Fund that it has adopted procedures
     reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating such code of
     ethics.

II.  DEFINITIONS

For purposes of this Code, the following terms have the meanings set forth as
follows:

     A. "Access Person" means:

          1. any director, officer or general partner of a Fund, and any
          Advisory Person of a Fund's investment adviser ("Adviser") or any
          sub-adviser ("Sub-Adviser");(2) and

          2. any director, officer or general partner of the Placement Agent
          who, in the ordinary course of business, makes, participates in or
          obtains information regarding a Purchase or Sale of Covered Securities
          for the Funds or whose functions or duties as part of the ordinary
          course of business relate to the making of any recommendation to the
          Funds regarding any Purchase or Sale of Covered Securities.

- ----------
(2)  If the Adviser or Sub-Adviser's primary business is advising funds or
     advisory clients, all of the Adviser's or Sub-Adviser's directors,
     officers, and general partners are presumed to be Access Persons of the
     Fund. If the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser is primarily engaged in a business
     other than advising funds or advisory clients, "Access Person" means any
     director, officer, general partner or Advisory Person of the Adviser or a
     Sub-Adviser who, with respect to the Fund for which such entity acts as
     Adviser or Sub-Adviser, makes any recommendation, participates in
     determining which recommendations shall be made, or whose principal
     function or duties relate to determining which recommendations shall be
     made or who, in connection with his or her duties, obtains any information
     concerning securities recommendations being made by such Adviser or
     Sub-Adviser.


                                       2

<PAGE>

     B. "Advisory Person" means:

          1. any director, officer, general partner or employee of the Adviser
          or a Sub-Adviser (or of any company in a Control relationship to a
          Fund, the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser) who, in connection with his or her
          regular functions or duties, makes, participates in, or obtains
          information regarding the Purchase or Sale of a Covered Security by
          the Fund or whose functions relate to the making of any
          recommendations with respect to such Purchases or Sales; and

          2. any natural person in a Control relationship to a Fund, Adviser or
          Sub-Adviser who obtains information concerning recommendations made to
          the Fund with regard to the Purchase or Sale of a Covered Security by
          the Fund.

     C. "Affiliated Person" of another person shall mean:

          1. any person directly or indirectly owning, controlling, or holding
          with power to vote, 5 per centum or more of the outstanding voting
          securities of such other person;

          2. any person 5 per centum or more of whose outstanding voting
          securities are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or held with
          power to vote, by such other person;

          3. any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or
          under common control with, such other person;

          4. any officer, director, partner, copartner, or employee of such
          other person; and

          5. with respect to a Fund, the Adviser and any Sub-Adviser.

     D. "Automatic Investment Plan" means a program in which regular periodic
     purchases (or withdrawals) are made automatically in (or from) investment
     accounts in accordance with a predetermined schedule and allocation. An
     Automatic Investment Plan includes a dividend reinvestment plan.

     E. "Board" means a Fund's Board of Directors.

     F. "Beneficial Ownership" is to be determined in the same manner as it is
     determined for purposes of Rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange
     Act of 1934. This means that a person should generally consider himself or
     herself the beneficial owner of any securities of which he or she shares in
     the profits, even if he or she has no influence on voting or disposition of
     the securities; but does not include securities held by limited
     partnerships where the person is not aware of such security holding and has
     no control or discretion as to its disposition.

     G. "Control" shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Section
     2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act. Section 2(a)(9) defines "control" as the power to
     exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a
     company, unless such power is solely the result of an official position
     with such company. Ownership of more than 25% of a company's outstanding
     voting securities is presumed to give the holder thereof control over the
     company.


                                       3

<PAGE>

     H. "Covered Security" has the same meaning as that set forth in Rule
     17j-1(a)(4), which defines the term very broadly, but excludes direct
     obligations of the U.S. government, bankers' acceptances, bank certificates
     of deposit, commercial paper, high quality short-term debt instruments
     (including repurchase agreements), and shares issued by a registered
     open-end investment company.

     I. "Disinterested Director" means a director of a Fund who is not an
     "interested person" of the Fund within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of
     the 1940 Act.

     J. "Initial Public Offering" means an offering of securities registered
     under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), the
     issuer of which, immediately before the registration, was not subject to
     the reporting requirements of Section 13 or Section 15(d) of the Securities
     Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

     K. "Investment Fund" has the same meaning as set forth in a Fund's private
     placement memorandum.

     L. "Investment Personnel" means:

          1. Any employee of a Fund, the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser (or of any
          company in a Control relationship to the Fund, the Adviser or a
          Sub-Adviser) who, in connection with his or her regular functions or
          duties, makes or participates in making recommendations regarding the
          purchase or sale of securities by the Fund.

          2. Any natural person who controls a Fund, the Adviser or a
          Sub-Adviser and who obtains information concerning recommendations
          made to the Fund regarding the purchase or sale of securities by the
          Fund.

     M. "Limited Offering" means an offering that is exempt from registration
     under the Securities Act pursuant to section 4(2) or 4(6) or pursuant to
     rule 504, rule 505, or rule 506 under the Securities Act.

     N. "Purchase or Sale of a Covered Security" means obtaining or disposing of
     Beneficial Ownership of that Covered Security and includes, among other
     things, the writing of an option to purchase or sell a Covered Security.

     O. "Restricted Period," with respect to a Covered Security, is the period
     of time currently designated as fifteen (15) days before or after the time
     that the same (or a related) Covered Security is purchased or sold by the
     Fund.

     P. "Review Officer" shall mean the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO"),
     or any other person charged with the responsibility, at any given time, to
     pre-clear trades, grant exceptions to prohibitions under the Code, receive
     reports and notices required by this Code to be generated, and to
     accomplish any other requirement of this Code.

          1. A person may be designated by a Board or the CCO as a Review
          Officer of a Fund (or the CCO may undertake the responsibility of
          serving as the Review Officer) for purposes of this Code without
          otherwise formally carrying that title or the responsibility for
          functions otherwise generally associated with the responsibilities of
          a compliance officer.

          2. The Review Officer may delegate certain functions as appropriate.


                                       4

<PAGE>

     Q. "Security held or to be Acquired by a Fund" shall mean

          1. Any Covered Security which, within the most recent 15 days:

               (a) Is or has been directly held by the Fund; or

               (b) Is being or has been considered by the Fund or the Adviser
               for purchase by the Fund; and

          2. Any option to purchase or sell, and any security convertible into
          or exchangeable for, a Covered Security.

          3. Specifically excluded from this definition are any Covered
          Securities in which the Fund has no investment discretion and that the
          Fund has no current knowledge are being held on its behalf (i.e., an
          investment by the Fund in an Investment Fund) for which the manager of
          the Investment Fund has full discretion to buy or sell securities
          without consultation or input from the Fund).

     The CCO of the Funds may provide the Boards with a list of each Security
     held or to be Acquired by a Fund on not less than a quarterly basis. The
     Boards, Access Persons and Advisory Persons are entitled to rely on this
     list in conducting their personal affairs in compliance with the Code. In
     the event that any such person breaches the Code due to a misstatement or
     omission with respect to such list, such person shall not be deemed
     responsible for such breach, unless he or she had actual knowledge that his
     or her actions would result in a breach (i.e., knew that the security
     transaction being conducted by such person was a breach of the Code).

III. APPROVAL, ADOPTION AND ADMINISTRATION OF CODE OF ETHICS

     A. Each Company must:

          1. adopt a written Code containing provisions reasonably necessary to
          prevent Access Persons from violating the Code;

          2. provide the written Code and any amendments thereto to the Boards;
          and

          3. provide a written certification to the Boards that it has adopted
          procedures reasonably necessary to prevent Access Persons from
          violating the Code.

     B. The Boards, including a majority of the Disinterested Directors, must
     approve this Code, as well as the applicable code of ethics of the Adviser
     and any Sub-Adviser to a Fund. The Boards must base their approval on a
     determination that the relevant Code contains provisions reasonably
     necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating the Code.

     C. Following initial approval of this Code and the code of ethics of the
     Adviser or any Sub-Adviser to a Fund, any material change to a Code must be
     approved by the Board of the Fund, including a majority of the
     Disinterested Directors thereof, within six months of such amendment.

     D. No less frequently than annually, each Fund, the Adviser, each
     Sub-Adviser and the Placement Agent must furnish to the Boards, and the
     Boards must consider, a written report that:


                                       5

<PAGE>

          1. Describes any issues arising under the Code or a code of ethics
          applicable to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser since the last report to the
          Boards, including, but not limited to, information about material
          violations of the code or procedures and sanctions imposed in response
          to the material violations, summarizes any changes in the procedures
          made during the past year, and identifies any recommended changes in
          existing restrictions or procedures based upon the Funds', the
          Adviser's, the Sub-Adviser's and the Placement Agent's experience,
          evolving industry practice, or developments in applicable laws and
          regulations; and

          2. Certifies that the Fund, the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser and the
          Placement Agent, as applicable, has adopted procedures reasonably
          necessary to prevent Access Persons from violating the Code or a code
          of ethics applicable to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser (as applicable).

IV.  LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

     A. General Prohibitions

     It is the policy of the Companies that no Access Person, any Affiliated
     Person of a Fund, or any Affiliated Person of the Adviser or the Placement
     Agent, shall engage in any act, practice or course of conduct that would
     violate the provisions of Rule 17j-1.

     Rule 17j-1(b) under the 1940 Act provides that the Placement Agent, any
     Affiliated Person of a Fund, and any Affiliated Person of the Adviser or
     the Placement Agent, in connection with the purchase or sale, directly or
     indirectly, by such person of a Security Held or to be Acquired by the Fund
     shall NOT:

          1. employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud a Fund;

          2. make to the Fund any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
          state to the Fund a material fact necessary in order to make the
          statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were
          made, not misleading;

          3. engage in any act, practice or course of business that would
          operate as a fraud or deceit upon the Fund; or

          4. engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the Fund.

     B. Reporting Obligations

     Each Access Person shall file the following reports with the Review
     Officer. Please note that special provisions apply to Disinterested
     Directors, as detailed in paragraph B.5 below.

          1. Initial Holdings Report. No later than ten (10) days after the
          person becomes an Access Person under this Code, each Access Person
          (other than a Fund's Disinterested Directors) must provide to the
          Review Officer an initial holdings report, which is current as of a
          date no more than 45 days prior to the date the reporting person
          becomes an Access Person, containing the following information:


                                       6

<PAGE>

               a. The title, number of shares and principal amount of each
               Covered Security in which the Access Person had any direct or
               indirect beneficial ownership when the person became an Access
               Person;

               b. The name of any broker, dealer or bank with whom the Access
               Person maintained an account in which any securities were held
               for the direct or indirect benefit of the Access Person as of the
               date the person became an Access Person; and

               c. The date that the report is submitted by the Access Person.

          2. Quarterly Reports. Each Access Person (subject to paragraph B.5
          with respect to a Fund's Disinterested Directors) must provide to the
          Review Officer, on a quarterly basis, not later than thirty (30) days
          after the end of the calendar quarter, a report containing the
          following information:

               a. With respect to any transaction during the quarter in a
               Covered Security in which the Access Person had any direct or

               b. With respect to any account established by the Access Person
               in which any securities were held during the quarter for the
               direct or indirect benefit of the Access Person:

                    i. The name of the broker, dealer or bank with whom the

                    ii. The date the account was established; and

                    iii. The date that the report is submitted by the Access
                    Person.

          Disinterested Directors) must annually provide to the Review Officer a
          complete listing of all Covered Securities owned by the Access Person,
          no later than February 14 of each year, which report must be current
          as of a date no more than 45 days before the report is submitted. The
          listing must contain the following information:


                                       7

<PAGE>

               a. The title, number of shares and principal amount of each
               Covered Security in which the Access Person had any direct or
               indirect beneficial ownership;

               b. The name of any broker, dealer or bank with whom the Access
               Person maintains an account in which any securities are held for
               the direct or indirect benefit of the Access Person; and

               c. The date that the report is submitted by the Access Person.

          4. Annual Certification. All Access Persons shall be required to
          certify annually that they have received, read and understand the
          Code. Further, all Access Persons are required to certify annually
          that they have complied with the requirements of the Code and that
          they have disclosed or reported all personal securities transactions
          required to be disclosed or reported pursuant to the Code.

          5. Disinterested Directors. A Disinterested Director is required to
          complete a quarterly report ONLY if (i) the Disinterested Director
          knew, or in the ordinary course of fulfilling his or her official
          duties as a Fund director should have known, that during the 15-day
          period immediately before or after his or her transaction, such
          Covered Security was Purchased or Sold, or considered for Purchase or
          Sale, by the Fund;(3) or (ii) during the relevant quarter, the
          Disinterested Director has engaged in what he or she believes may be
          construed as short-term trading in the securities of a registered
          open-end investment company that is advised by the Adviser or an
          affiliate of the Adviser. The "should have known" standard implies no
          duty of inquiry, does not presume there should have been any deduction
          or extrapolation from discussions or memoranda dealing with tactics to
          be employed in meeting any of a Fund's investment objectives, or that
          any knowledge is to be imputed because of prior knowledge of the
          Funds' portfolio holdings, market considerations, or the Funds'
          investment policies and objectives or investment restrictions.

     C. Exceptions from Reporting Requirements

     An Access Person need not submit:

          1. Any report with respect to Covered Securities held in accounts over
          which the Access Person had no direct or indirect influence or
          control;

          2. A quarterly report if the report would duplicate information
          contained in broker trade confirmations or account statements received
          by the Funds, the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser or the Placement Agent no
          later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter and/or
          information contained in the Adviser's, Sub-Adviser's, Placement
          Agent's and/or the Funds' records.

          3. Reports otherwise required by this Section, if the Access Person is
          also an Access Person of the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser to the Funds,
          provided that either:

- ----------
(3)  This reporting requirement shall not be applicable to securities traded by
     passively managed index funds.


                                       8

<PAGE>

               a. such person submits to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser forms
               prescribed by the code of ethics of such Adviser or Sub-Adviser
               containing substantially the same information as called for in
               the forms required by this Section; or

               b. the information is such report would duplicate information
               required to be recorded under Rule 204-2(a)(13) under the
               Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

          4. A quarterly report with respect to transactions effected pursuant
          to an Automatic Investment Plan.

V.   PRE-CLEARANCE OF SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

Investment Personnel must obtain approval from the CCO or the Review Officer
before directly or indirectly acquiring Beneficial Ownership of any Covered
Security as part of an Initial Public Offering or Limited Offering. Investment
Personnel who are subject to the code of ethics of the Adviser or a Sub-Adviser
need not submit to this procedure provided that such person is subject to a
similar procedure under such other code of ethics.

VI.  CONFIDENTIALITY

All reports of securities transactions and any other information filed with a
Fund pursuant to this Code shall be treated as confidential. Any such report may
contain a statement that the report shall not be construed as an admission by
the person making such report that he or she has any direct or indirect
beneficial ownership in the security to which the report relates.

No Access Person shall reveal to any other person (except in the normal course
of his or her duties on behalf of a Fund) any information regarding securities
transactions made or being considered by or on behalf of the Funds.

VII. REVIEW AND ENFORCEMENT

     A. The Review Officer for each Fund, in consultation with other Review
     Officers, shall compare all reported personal securities transactions with
     completed portfolio transactions of each Fund and a list of securities
     being considered for purchase or sale by each Fund to determine whether a
     violation of this Code may have occurred. One test that may be applied in
     determining whether a violation of the Code has occurred will be to review
     the securities transactions of Access Persons for patterns of transactions.
     For example:

          1. Any pattern involving parallel transactions (for the Fund and the
          individual both buying or both selling the same Covered Security) or
          opposite transactions (buy/sell or sell/buy) within the Restricted
          Period may be analyzed to determine whether the individual's
          transaction may have violated the Code.

          2. Among the other factors that may be considered in the analysis are:

               a. the number and dollar amount of the transactions;

               b. the trading volume of the Covered Security in question;

               c. the length of time the Covered Security has been held by the
               individual; and


                                       9

<PAGE>

               d. the individual's involvement in the investment process.

     It should be noted, however, that a violation could be deemed to have
     resulted from a single transaction if the circumstances warrant a finding
     that the underlying principles of fair dealing have been violated. Before
     making any determination that a violation has been committed by any person,
     the Review Officer shall give such person an opportunity to supply
     additional explanatory material.

     B. If the Review Officer determines that a violation of this Code may have
     occurred, the Review Officer shall submit his or her written determination,
     together with a confidential report and any additional explanatory material
     provided by the individual, to the CCO (if different from the Review
     Officer) or the CCO's delegate and outside counsel to the Funds, who shall
     make an independent determination as to whether a violation has occurred.

     C. If the CCO (or delegate) and outside counsel to the Funds find that a
     violation has occurred, the CCO, in consultation with the Fund's President,
     shall impose upon the individual such sanctions as he or she deems
     appropriate and shall report the violation and the sanction imposed to the
     Funds' Boards.

     D. No person shall participate in a determination of (1) whether he or she
     personally has committed a violation of the Code, or (2) the imposition of
     any sanction in the event he or she committed a violation of the Code. If a
     Covered Securities transaction of the CCO is under consideration, the
     President of the Funds shall act in all respects in the manner prescribed
     in this Code for the CCO.

VIII. RECORDS

Each Fund shall maintain records in the manner and to the extent set forth
below, which may be maintained on microfilm or by such other means permissible
under the conditions described in Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act or under
no-action letters or interpretations under that rule, and shall be available for
examination by representatives of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

     A. A copy of this Code shall be preserved in an easily accessible place
     (including for five (5) years after this Code is no longer in effect).

     B. A record of any violation of this Code and of any action taken as a
     result of such violation shall be preserved in an easily accessible place
     for a period of not less than five (5) years following the end of the
     fiscal year in which the violation occurs.

     C. A copy of each report to the Board and each report, including any
     information provided in lieu of the report, made by an Access Person
     pursuant to this Code shall be preserved for a period of not less than five
     (5) years from the end of the fiscal year in which it is made, the first
     two years in an easily accessible place.

     D. A list of all Access Persons who are, or within the past five (5) years
     have been, required to make reports pursuant to this Code shall be
     maintained in an easily accessible place.

     E. A record of any decision, and the reasons supporting the decision, to
     approve the acquisition by Investment Personnel of securities under Section
     V of this Code shall be preserved for at least five years after the end of
     the fiscal year in which the approval is granted, the first two years in an
     easily accessible place.

IX.  APPROVAL, AMENDMENT AND INTERPRETATION OF PROVISIONS

     A. This Code may be amended as necessary or appropriate with the approval

                           (COLLECTIVELY, THE "FUNDS")

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE

The Funds seek to assure that proxies received by the Funds are voted in the
best interests of the Funds' stockholders and have accordingly adopted these
procedures.

II. DELEGATION OF PROXY VOTING/ADOPTION OF ADVISER AND SUB-ADVISER POLICIES

Except as provided in Section III below, each Fund delegates the authority to
vote proxies related to portfolio securities to Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the
"Adviser"), as investment adviser to each Fund. For each portion of the Fund's
portfolio managed by a sub-adviser retained to provide day-to-day portfolio
management for that portion of the Fund's portfolio (each, a "Sub-Adviser"), the
Adviser in turn may delegate its proxy voting authority to the Sub-Adviser
responsible for that portion of the Fund's portfolio. The Board of Directors of
each Fund adopts the proxy voting policies and procedures of the Adviser and
Sub-Advisers as the proxy voting policies and procedures that will be used by
each of these respective entities when exercising voting authority on behalf of
the Fund. These policies and procedures are attached hereto.

III. RETENTION OF PROXY VOTING AUTHORITY

With respect to proxies issued by the Master Fund, the Feeder Funds do not
delegate to the Adviser, but instead retain, their proxy voting authority. After
receiving a proxy issued by the Master Fund, the Feeder Fund will hold a meeting
of its Partners at which the Partners will vote their Interests to instruct the
Feeder Fund to vote for or against the matter presented by the Master Fund. The
Feeder Fund will then calculate the proportion of Interests voted for to those
voted against (ignoring for purposes of this calculation the Interests for which
it receives no voting instructions) and will subsequently vote its Interests in
the Master Fund for or against the matter in the same proportion.

IV. CONSENT IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT OF INTEREST

If for a particular proxy vote the Adviser or Sub-Adviser seeks a Fund's consent
to vote because of a conflict of interest or for other reasons, any two
independent directors of the Fund may provide the Fund's consent to vote.

V. ANNUAL REVIEW OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES OF ADVISER AND SUB-ADVISERS

The Board of Directors of each Fund will review on an annual basis the proxy
voting policies of the Adviser and Sub-Advisers applicable to the Fund.

Dated: March 10, 2004, as amended March 17, 2005.

                            ENDOWMENT ADVISERS, L.P.

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


The following are proxy voting policies and procedures ("Policies and
Procedures") adopted by Endowment Advisers, LP ("Endowment Advisers"), an
investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Advisers Act"),
with respect to voting securities held by client portfolios. Clients include The
Endowment Registered Fund, L.P., The Endowment TEI Fund, L.P. and The Endowment
Master Fund, L.P. (the "Funds") each of which is an investment company
registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
("1940 Act"), and may include in the future other registered investment
companies as well as individuals, partnerships and corporations. These Policies
and Procedures are adopted to ensure compliance by Endowment Advisers with Rule
206(4)-6 under the Advisers Act and other applicable fiduciary obligations under
rules and regulations of the SEC and interpretations of its staff. Endowment
Advisers follows these Policies and Procedures for each of its clients as
required under the Advisers Act and other applicable law, unless expressly
directed by a client in writing to refrain from voting that client's proxies or
to vote in accordance with the client's proxy voting policies and procedures.
With respect to the Funds, Endowment Advisers follows both these Policies and
Procedures and the proxy voting policies and procedures adopted by the Funds and
their Boards of Directors.

I. DEFINITIONS

A. "Best interest of clients". In the view of Endowment Advisers, this means
clients' best economic interest over the long term -- that is, the common
interest that all clients share in seeing the value of a common investment
increase over time. Clients may have differing political or social interests,
but their best economic interest is generally uniform.

B. "Material conflict of interest". Circumstances when Endowment Advisers, or
any member of its senior management or any of its portfolio managers or
portfolio analysts, knowingly does business with a particular proxy issuer or
closely affiliated entity which may appear to create a material conflict between
the interests of Endowment Advisers and the interests of its clients in how
proxies of that issuer are voted.

II. GENERAL POLICY

Where Endowment Advisers is given responsibility for voting proxies, we must
take reasonable steps under the circumstances to ensure that proxies are
received and voted with a view to enhancing the value of the shares of stock
held in client accounts.

These Policies and Procedures expressly address the voting of proxies or
securities with respect to which the issuers solicit proxies to vote on
proposals that are put to a vote of shareholders. Each Fund may invest all or
some portion of its assets in the securities of privately placed investment
vehicles ("Private Investment Funds"), which do not typically convey traditional
voting rights to the holder, and the occurrence of corporate governance or other
notices for this

<PAGE>

type of investment is substantially less that that encountered in connection
with registered equity securities. On occasion, however, each Fund or its
general partner(s) may receive notices from the Private Investment Funds seeking
the consent of holders in order to materially change certain rights within the
structure of the security issued by the Private Investment Fund or change
material terms of the Private Investment Fund's constituent documents. Endowment
Advisers shall follow these Policies and Procedures, to the extent applicable,
in exercising the rights of the Funds to vote or consent in connection with its
investments in Private Investment Funds. The Advisor shall take such action as
may be necessary to enable the Funds to comply with all disclosure and
recordkeeping obligations imposed by applicable rules and regulations.

The financial interest of our clients is the primary consideration in
determining how proxies should be voted. In the case of social and political
responsibility issues that in our view do not primarily involve financial
considerations, the diversity of our clients means that we are unable to
represent each such view in each instance. Thus, Endowment Advisers exercises
its vote on these issues in what it believes to be the best economic interests
of its clients unless a private account client has provided specific
instructions otherwise for its voting securities. When making specific proxy
decisions, Endowment Advisers generally adheres to its specific voting policies
contained in Section VI herein. The guidelines set forth positions of Endowment
Advisers on recurring issues and criteria for addressing non-recurring issues.
The general voting policies of Endowment Advisers are described below.

III. GENERAL VOTING POLICIES

     A. Client's Best Interest. These Policies and Procedures are designed and
implemented in a way that is reasonably expected to ensure that proxies are
voted in the best interest of clients. Proxies will be voted with the aim of
furthering the best economic interests of clients, promoting high levels of
corporate governance and adequate disclosure of company policies, activities and
returns, including fair and equal treatment of shareholders.

     B. Shareholder Activism. Endowment Advisers seeks to develop relationships
with the management of portfolio companies to encourage transparency and
improvements in the treatment owners and stakeholders. Thus, Endowment Advisers
may engage in dialogue with the management of portfolio companies with respect
to pending proxy voting issues.

     C. Case-by-Case Basis. While these Policies and Procedures guide our
decisions, each proxy vote is ultimately cast on a case-by-case basis, taking
into consideration the contractual obligations under the advisory agreement or
comparable document, and all other relevant facts and circumstances at the time
of the vote. Endowment Advisers may cast proxy votes in favor of management
proposals or seek to change the views of management, considering specific issues
as they arise on their merits. Endowment Advisers may also join with other
investment managers in seeking to submit a shareholder proposal to a company or
to oppose a proposal submitted by the company. Any such action is primarily
based on grounds of fundamental share value.

     D. Individualized. These Policies and Procedures are tailored to suit the
advisory business of Endowment Advisers and the types of securities portfolios
it manages. To the extent that


                                       2
<PAGE>


clients have adopted their own procedures, Endowment Advisers may vote the
same securities differently depending upon clients' directions.

     E. Material Conflicts of Interest. Material conflicts are resolved in the
best interest of clients. When a material conflict of interest between Endowment
Advisers and its respective client(s) is identified, Endowment Advisers will
choose among the procedures set forth in Section IV.B.2.b.3, below, to resolve
such conflict.

     F. Limitations. The circumstances under which Endowment Advisers may take a
limited role in voting proxies, include the following.

          1. No Responsibility. Endowment Advisers will not vote proxies for
client accounts in which the client contract specifies that Endowment Advisers
will not vote. Under such circumstances, the clients' custodians ("Custodians")
are instructed to mail proxy material directly to such clients.

          2. Limited Value. Endowment Advisers may abstain from voting a client
proxy if the effect on shareholders' economic interests or the value of the
portfolio holding is indeterminable or insignificant.

          3. Unjustifiable Costs. Endowment Advisers may abstain from voting a
client proxy for cost reasons.

          4. Securities Lending Arrangements. If voting securities are part of a
securities lending program, Endowment Advisers may be unable to vote while the
securities are on loan.

          5. Special Considerations. The responsibilities of Endowment Advisers
for voting proxies are determined generally by its obligations under each
advisory contract or similar document. If a client requests in writing that
Endowment Advisers vote its proxy in a manner inconsistent with these Policies
and Procedures, Endowment Advisers may follow the client's direction or may
request that the client vote the proxy directly. As a courtesy to certain
clients, Endowment Advisers may, from time to time, agree to vote proxies on
securities over which Endowment Advisers holds no discretionary management
authority. Endowment Advisers is under no obligation to vote these securities as
they are not part of the clients' managed accounts, Endowment Advisers exercises
no discretion over such securities, and they are not generally included in the
securities which Endowment Advisers follows as an investment adviser. To the
extent that Endowment Advisers has agreed to perform the courtesy service of
mechanically casting the vote on any such securities and no specific voting
instructions are provided by the client(s), Endowment Advisers will not research
the companies and will either vote with management or abstain unless the
security being voted happens to be covered by Endowment Advisers in its capacity
as investment adviser.

     G. Sources of Information. Endowment Advisers may conduct research
internally and/or use the resources of an independent research consultant.
Endowment Advisers may consider legislative materials, studies of corporate
governance and other proxy voting issues, and/or analyses of shareholder and
management proposals by a certain sector of companies, e.g. small cap companies.


                                       3
<PAGE>

     H. Availability of Policies and Procedures. Endowment Advisers will provide
clients with a copy of these Policies and Procedures, as revised from time to
time, upon request.

     I. Disclosure of Vote. A client may obtain information on how its proxies
were voted by requesting such information from Endowment Advisers. Endowment
Advisers does not generally disclose client proxy votes to third parties, other
than as required for the Funds, unless specifically requested, in writing, by
the client.

IV. PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES

     A. General

          1. Accounts for Which Endowment Advisers Has Proxy Voting
Responsibility

Endowment Advisers is generally responsible for voting proxies with respect to
securities held in client accounts unless the investment management agreement
explicitly states that Endowment Advisers will not vote proxies for the account.
Endowment Advisers is not responsible for voting client securities which are not
part of the managed account. However, Endowment Advisers may, as a courtesy,
vote certain client securities which are not part of the managed account at the
request of its clients subject to the limitations described in Section III.F.6.,
above.

          2. Adherence to Client Proxy Voting Policies

If a client has its own proxy voting policy, Endowment Advisers and the client
will agree in writing on whether Endowment Advisers will vote in accordance with
its own policy, whether Endowment Advisers will vote that client's securities in
accordance with the client's policy or whether the client will vote its own
securities.

          3. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Intentions

Endowment Advisers personnel should not discuss with members of the public how
Endowment Advisers intends to vote on any particular proxy proposal. This does
not restrict communications in the ordinary course of business with other
clients for which Endowment Advisers votes proxies. Disclosure of Endowment
Advisers' proxy voting intentions - especially where done with the purpose or
effect of influencing the management or control of a company - could trigger
various restrictions under the federal securities laws, including under the
proxy solicitation, beneficial ownership and short-swing profit liability
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In the event that
Endowment Advisers wishes to discuss its voting intentions outside the firm,
Endowment Advisers should consult with its counsel before any such discussions.

     B. Operational Procedures

          1. Role of the Proxy Administrator

Once a client account is established and the proxy voting responsibility is
determined, the Proxy Administrator ("PA"), is responsible for receiving and
processing proxies for securities held in


                                       4
<PAGE>

the portfolios of our clients and ensuring that votes are cast. The PA is
responsible for ensuring that the registered owners of record, e.g. the client,
trustee or custodian bank, that receive proxy materials from the issuer or its
information agent, forward proxy materials to Endowment Advisers. Proxies may
also be delivered electronically through a proxy service. The PA logs in any
proxy materials received, matches them to the securities to be voted and
confirms that the correct amount of shares, as of the record date, is reflected
on the proxy. Once the proxy statement is logged in, the PA gives it to a
research analyst ("Analyst") for consideration.

The PA also compiles and maintains information, for each client for which
Endowment Advisers votes proxies, showing the issuer's name, meeting date and
manner in which it voted on each proxy proposal. The PA is also responsible for
monitoring compliance with client proxy voting policies. A copy of each proxy
statement is kept. Endowment Advisers generally seeks to vote proxies at least
one (1) week prior to the deadline. Unfortunately, proxy materials are often
received with less than a week's time before the deadline, and in such cases,
Endowment Advisers uses reasonable efforts to exercise its vote.

     2. Material Conflicts of Interest

          a. Endowment Advisers will take steps to identify the existence of any
material conflicts of interest relating to the securities to be voted or the
issue at hand. Senior management, portfolio managers and Analysts of Endowment
Advisers are expected to disclose to the PA any personal conflicts such as
officer or director positions held by them, their spouses or close relatives in
the portfolio company. Conflicts based on business relationships or dealings of
affiliates of Endowment Advisers will only be considered to the extent that the
Endowment Advisers has actual knowledge of such business relationships.

          b. When a material conflict of interest between Endowment Advisers'
interests and its clients' interests appears to exist, Endowment Advisers may
choose among the following options to eliminate such conflict: (1) vote in
accordance with these Policies and Procedures if it involves little or no
discretion; (2) vote as recommended by a third-party service if Endowment
Advisers utilizes such a service; (3) "echo vote" or "mirror vote" the proxies
in the same proportion as the votes of other proxy holders that are not clients
of Endowment Advisers; (4) if possible, erect information barriers around the
person or persons making voting decisions sufficient to insulate the decision
from the conflict; (5) if practical, notify affected clients of the conflict of
interest and seek a waiver of the conflict; or (6) if agreed upon in writing
with the client, forward the proxies to affected clients allowing them to vote
their own proxies.

     3. Role of the Research Analysts

The PA ensures that each proxy statement is directed to the Analyst responsible
for following the particular security or industry. The Analysts are responsible
for considering the substantive issues relating to any vote, deciding how the
shares will be voted, and instructing the PA how to vote the proxies. In
determining how to vote a given proxy, Analysts will adhere to these Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, as revised from time to time, except to the
extent superseded by client proxy voting policies or to the extent that a
material conflict of interest is identified. In the event of a personal material
conflict of interest, the Analyst will refer the decision to another Endowment
Advisers Analyst who has no such conflict. In the event of an organizational


                                       5
<PAGE>


conflict, Endowment Advisers will follow the procedures outlined in Section
IV.B.2.b.3, above. If there is no material conflict of interest, the vote
recommendation will be forwarded to the PA to be cast. The Analyst may consult
with the PA and/or Senior Management as necessary to identify and resolve
conflicts. Analysts are responsible for documenting the rationale for any vote
recommendation.

     4. Role of the Third-Party Service Provider(s)

Endowment Advisers may engage a third-party service provider to provide
notification of impending votes, including shareholder resolutions, which may be
viewed on-line. In addition, Endowment Advisers may engage a third-party service
provider to provide web-based proxy voting and recordkeeping services.

V. DOCUMENTATION, RECORDKEEPING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

     A. Documentation. The PA is responsible for:

          1. implementing and updating these Policies and Procedures;

          2. overseeing the proxy voting process;

          3. consulting with Analysts for the relevant portfolio security; and

          4. maintaining proxy voting records.

     B. Recordkeeping.

          1. Endowment Advisers will maintain records of all proxies voted.

          2. As required by Rule 204-2(c), such records will include: (a) a copy
of the Policies and Procedures; (b) a copy of any document created by Endowment
Advisers that was material to making a decision how to vote proxies on behalf of
a client or that memorializes the basis for that decision; and (c) each written
client request for proxy voting records and Endowment Advisers' written response
to any (written or oral) client request for such records.

          3. Endowment Advisers will maintain its own proxy statements and
record of votes cast. As permitted by Rule 204-2(c), proxy statements and the
record of each vote cast by each client account will be maintained by ADP.
Endowment Advisers has obtained an undertaking from ADP to provide Endowment
Advisers copies of proxy voting records and other documents promptly upon
request. Endowment Advisers or ADP may rely on the SEC's EDGAR system to keep
records of certain proxy statements if the proxy statements are maintained by
issuers on that system (e.g., large U.S.-based issuers).]

          4. Duration. Proxy voting books and records will be maintained in an
easily accessible place for a period of five years, the first two in Endowment
Advisers' office.


                                       6
<PAGE>


     C. Reporting. Endowment Advisers will initially inform clients of these
Policies and Procedures and how a client may learn of the voting record for
client's securities through summary disclosure in Part II of Endowment Advisers'
Form ADV. Upon receipt of a client's request for more information, Endowment
Advisers will provide to the client a copy of these Policies and Procedures
and/or, in accordance with the client's stated requirements, how the client's
proxies were voted during the period requested subsequent to the adoption of
these Policies and Procedures. Such periodic reports, other than those required
for the Funds, will not be made available to third parties absent the express
written request of the client.

Review of Policies and Procedures. These Policies and Procedures will be subject
to period review as deemed appropriate by Endowment Advisers.

VI. SPECIFIC VOTING POLICIES

     A. Summary.

Endowment Advisers' current policies with respect to a number of common issues
are briefly summarized as follows:

     o    Endowment Advisers generally votes with the recommendations of a
          company's Board of Directors on routine or non-controversial issues
          (see examples below).

     o    In general, Endowment Advisers opposes anti-takeover proposals, unless
          unusual circumstances dictate otherwise.

     o    In general, Endowment Advisers votes to support the elimination of
          anti-takeover policies, unless unusual circumstances dictate
          otherwise.

     o    On issues relating to social and/or political responsibility,
          Endowment Advisers votes all client shares in what we believe to be
          the best economic interests of our clients unless directed by a client
          to vote in a certain manner.

     o    Proposals not covered by the above-stated guidelines and contested
          situations are evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the Analyst
          principally responsible for the particular security.

     B.   Examples of Proxy Voting With Management On Non-Controversial Matters.

     o    Election of directors, in the absence of a contest or controversy.

     o    Ratification of selection of independent auditors, in the absence of
          controversy.

          not increase the aggregate number of shares of stock available for
          grant under all currently active plans to over 10% of the total number
          of shares outstanding, and which Endowment Advisers does not oppose
          for other valid reasons.

     o    Stock splits, if not for anti-takeover purposes.

     o    Change of state of incorporation for specific corporate purposes and
          not for anti-takeover purposes.

          permitting purchase of company stock at 85% or more of fair market
          value.

     C.   Guidelines for Specific Proxy Voting Issues.


          1. The Board of Directors

               a. Voting on Director Nominees in Uncontested Elections

Votes on director nominees are made on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, examining the
following factors:

     o    Long-term corporate performance record relative to a market index;

     o    Composition of board and key board committees;

     o    Nominee's attendance at meetings (past two years);

     o    Nominee's investment in the company;

     o    Whether a retired CEO sits on the board; and

     o    Whether the chairman is also serving as CEO.

In cases of significant votes and when information is readily available, we also
review:

     o    Corporate governance provisions and takeover activity;

     o    Board decisions regarding executive pay;

     o    Director compensation;

     o    Number of other board seats held by nominee; and

     o    Interlocking directorships.

               b. Chairman and CEO are the Same Person

We vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis on shareholder proposals that would require the
positions of chairman and CEO to be held by different persons.

               c. Majority of Independent Directors

Shareholder proposals that request that the board be comprised of a majority of
independent directors are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

We vote FOR shareholder proposals that request that the board audit,
compensation and/or nominating committees include independent directors
exclusively.

               d. Stock Ownership Requirements

We generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals requiring directors to own a
minimum amount of company stock in order to qualify as a director, or to remain
on the board.

               e. Term of Office

We generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors.

               f. Director and Officer Indemnification and Liability Protection

Proposals concerning director and officer indemnification and liability
protection are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.


                                       8
<PAGE>

We generally vote AGAINST proposals to limit or eliminate entirely director and
officer liability for monetary damages for violating the duty of care.

We generally vote AGAINST indemnification proposals that would expand coverage
beyond just legal expenses to acts, such as negligence, that are more serious
violations of fiduciary obligations than mere carelessness.

We generally vote FOR only those proposals that provide such expanded coverage
in cases when a director's or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if: (1)
the director was found to have acted in good faith and in a manner that he
reasonably believed was in the best interests of the company, and (2) only if
the director's legal expenses would be covered.

          2. Charitable Contributions

We generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to eliminate, direct or
otherwise restrict charitable contributions.

          3. Proxy Contests

               a. Voting for Director Nominees in Contested Elections

Votes in a contested election of directors are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE
basis, considering the following factors:

     o    Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
          industry;

     o    Management's track record;

     o    Background to the proxy contest;

     o    Qualifications of director nominees (both slates);

     o    Evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders as well as the
          likelihood that the proposed objectives and goals can be met; and

     o    Stock ownership positions.

               b. Reimburse Proxy Solicitation Expenses

Decisions to provide full reimbursement for dissidents waging a proxy contest
are made on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

          4. Auditors

We generally vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless: an auditor has a
financial interest in or association with the company, and is therefore not
independent; or there is reason to believe that the independent auditor has
rendered an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
financial position.

the case of items that are conditioned upon each other, we examine the benefits
and costs of the packaged items. In instances when the joint effect of the

               g. Pre-emptive Rights

We review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis proposals to create or abolish pre-emptive
rights. In evaluating proposals on preemptive rights, we look at the size of a
company and the characteristics of its shareholder base.

               h. Debt Restructurings

We review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis proposals to increase common and/or preferred
shares and to issue shares as part of a debt-restructuring plan. We consider the
following issues:

Dilution - How much will ownership interest of existing shareholders be reduced,
and how extreme will dilution to any future earnings be?

Change in Control - Will the transaction result in a change in control of the
company?


                                       13
<PAGE>

Bankruptcy - Is the threat of bankruptcy, which would result in severe losses in
shareholder value, the main factor driving the debt restructuring?

Generally, we approve proposals that facilitate debt restructurings unless there
are clear signs of self-dealing or other abuses.

               i. Share Repurchase Programs

We vote FOR management proposals to institute open-market share repurchase plans
in which all shareholders may participate on equal terms.

          9. Executive and Director Compensation

In general, we vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis on executive and director
compensation plans, with the view that viable compensation programs reward the
creation of shareholder wealth by having a high payout sensitivity to increases
in shareholder value.

Other factors, such as repricing underwater stock options without shareholder
approval, would cause us to vote against a plan. Additionally, in some cases we
would vote against a plan deemed unnecessary.

               a. OBRA-Related Compensation Proposals

o AMENDMENTS THAT PLACE A CAP ON ANNUAL GRANT OR AMEND ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES

Vote FOR plans that simply amend shareholder-approved plans to include
administrative features or place a cap on the annual grants any one participant
may receive to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA").

o AMENDMENTS TO ADD PERFORMANCE-BASED GOALS

We vote FOR amendments to add performance goals to existing compensation plans
to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) of OBRA.

o AMENDMENTS TO INCREASE SHARES AND RETAIN TAX DEDUCTIONS UNDER OBRA

Votes on amendments to existing plans to increase shares reserved and to qualify
the plan for favorable tax treatment under the provisions of Section 162(m)
should be evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

o APPROVAL OF CASH OR CASH-AND-STOCK BONUS PLANS

We vote FOR cash or cash-and-stock bonus plans to exempt the compensation from
taxes under the provisions of Section 162(m) of OBRA.

               b. Shareholder Proposals to Limit Executive and Director Pay

We review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis all shareholder proposals that seek additional
disclosure of executive and director pay information.


                                       14
<PAGE>

We review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis all other shareholder proposals that seek to
limit executive and director pay.

               c. Golden and Tin Parachutes

We vote FOR shareholder proposals to have golden and tin parachutes submitted
for shareholder ratification.

We review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis all proposals to ratify or cancel golden or
tin parachutes.

               d. Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs)

We vote FOR proposals that request shareholder approval in order to implement an
ESOP or to increase authorized shares for existing ESOPs, except in cases when
the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is "excessive" (i.e., generally
greater than five percent of outstanding shares).

               e. 401(k) Employee Benefit Plans

We vote FOR proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for employees.

          10. State of Incorporation

               a. Voting on State Takeover Statutes

We review on a CASE-BY-CASE basis proposals to opt in or out of state takeover
statutes (including control share acquisitions statutes, control share cash-out
statutes, freeze-out provisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison
pill endorsements, severance pay and labor contract provisions, anti-greenmail
provisions, and disgorgement provisions).

               b. Voting on Reincorporation Proposals

Proposals to change a company's state of incorporation are examined on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis.

          11. Mergers and Corporate Restructurings

               a. Mergers and Acquisitions

Votes on mergers and acquisitions are considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, taking
into account at least the following:

     o    Anticipated financial and operating benefits;

     o    Offer price (cost vs. premium);

     o    Prospects of the combined companies;

     o    How the deal was negotiated; and

     o    Changes in corporate governance and their impact on shareholder
          rights.


                                       15
<PAGE>

               b. Corporate Restructuring

Votes on corporate restructuring proposals, including minority squeeze-outs,
leveraged buyouts, spin-offs, liquidations, and asset sales are considered on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis.

               c. Spin-offs

Votes on spin-offs are considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis depending on the tax
and regulatory advantages, planned use of sale proceeds, market focus, and
managerial incentives.

               d. Asset Sales

Votes on asset sales are made on a CASE-BY-CASE basis after considering the
impact on the balance sheet/working capital, value received for the asset, and
potential elimination of diseconomies.

               e. Liquidations

Votes on liquidations are made on a CASE-BY-CASE basis after reviewing
management's efforts to pursue other alternatives, appraisal value of assets,
and the compensation plan for executives managing the liquidation.

               f. Appraisal Rights

We vote FOR proposals to restore, or provide shareholders with, rights of
appraisal.

               g. Changing Corporate Name

We vote FOR changing the corporate name.

          12. Mutual Fund Proxies

                        IA POLICIES AND PROCEDURES MANUAL
                               PROXY VOTING POLICY

Investment advisers registered with the SEC, and which exercise voting authority
with respect to client securities, are required by Rule 206(4)-6 of the Advisers

reasonably designed to ensure that client securities are voted in the best
interests of clients, which must include how you address material conflicts that
may arise between an adviser's interests and those of its clients; (b) to
disclose to clients how they may obtain information from the adviser with
respect to the voting of proxies for their securities; and (c) to describe to
clients a summary of its proxy voting policies and procedures and, upon request,

RESPONSIBILITY

The President has the responsibility for the implementation and monitoring of
our proxy voting policy, practices, disclosures and record keeping, including

          clients to the Portfolio Manager of record;

     o    Portfolio Manager will determine which client accounts hold the
          security to which the proxy relates;

     o    Absent material conflicts, the Portfolio Manager of record will

          client's proxies, and that clients may request a copy of these
          policies and procedures.

     o    Tanglewood Asset Management, LLC will also send a copy of this summary

3. Client Requests for Information

     o    All client requests for information regarding proxy votes, or policies
          and procedures, received by any employee should be forwarded to
          Tanglewood Asset Management, LLC.

          the client's proxy with respect to each proposal about which client
          inquired.

4. Voting Guidelines

     o    In the absence of specific voting guidelines from the client,
          Tanglewood Asset Management, LLC will vote proxies in the best
          interests of each particular client. Tanglewood Asset Management,
          LLC's policy is to vote all proxies from a specific issuer the same
          way for each client absent qualifying restrictions from a client.
          Clients are permitted to place reasonable restrictions on Tanglewood

          may place such restrictions on the actual selection of account
          securities.

     o    Tanglewood Asset Management, LLC will generally vote in favor of
          routine corporate housekeeping proposals such as the election of

<PAGE>

     o    Tanglewood Asset Management, LLC will identify any conflicts that
          exist between the interests of the adviser and the client by reviewing

          relationship with the issuer.

     o    If a material conflict of interest exists, the President will
          determine whether it is appropriate to disclose the conflict to the
          affected clients, to give the clients an opportunity to vote the
          proxies themselves, or to address the voting issue through other
          objective means such as voting in a manner consistent with a
          predetermined voting policy or receiving an independent third party
          voting recommendation.

     o    Tanglewood Asset Management, LLC will maintain a record of the voting
          resolution of any conflict of interest.
