(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return  is
determined by subtracting  the initial  investment  from the value at the end of
the period and dividing the remainder by the initial  investment  and expressing
the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that all income  dividends
and capital gain distributions have been reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's  dividend  reinvestment  plan.  Total  return  does  not  reflect  broker
commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period of less than one year is
not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.  Total
return,  price,  yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market
conditions.  This data is provided for information  only and is not intended for
trading purposes.  Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously
offered.  There is a  one-time  public  offering  and  once  issued,  shares  of
closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Net asset
value is total assets  applicable to common  shareholders less total liabilities
divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings  are  subject to
change daily.

(3) Dividend Yield is determined by dividing the annualized  current monthly per
share  dividend to common  shareholders  by the market price per common share at
June 30, 2004.

NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2004
================================================================================


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nicholas-Applegate  Convertible & Income Fund II (the "Fund") was organized as a
Massachusetts  business trust on April 22, 2003. Prior to commencing  operations
on July 31, 2003, the Fund had no operations  other than matters relating to its
organization and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment
company under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended,  and the sale and
issuance of 6,981 shares of beneficial  interest at an aggregate  purchase price
of $100,003 to Allianz Dresdner Asset Management of America,  L.P. ("ADAM").  PA
Fund  Management LLC (the  "Investment  Manager"),  formerly PIMCO Advisors Fund
Management  LLC.  serves as the Fund's  investment  manager  and is an  indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is an indirect,  majority-owned subsidiary
of Allianz AG. The Fund has an  unlimited  amount of $0.00001  par value  common
stock authorized.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide total return through a combination
of capital  appreciation  and high current income.  The Fund attempts to achieve
this  objective  by  investing  in a portfolio  of  convertible  securities  and
non-convertible income-producing securities.

The  Fund  issued  55,000,000  shares  of  common  stock in its  initial  public
offering.  An additional  1,250,000  shares were issued in  connection  with the
exercise  of the  underwriters'  over-allotment  option.  These  shares were all
issued at $15.00 per share before an underwriting  discount of $0.675 per share.
Common offering costs of $1,382,275  (representing $0.025 per share) were offset
against the proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital in
excess of par. The Investment  Manager  agreed to pay all common  offering costs
(other  than the sales load) and  organizational  expenses  exceeding  $0.03 per
share.  Because aggregate offering costs and  organizational  expenses were less
than $0.03 per common share, organizational expenses of $25,000 were expensed in
the current period. In addition, the underwriters  commission and offering costs
associated  with the issuance of Preferred  Shares in the amounts of  $5,050,000
and $594,817,  respectively,  have been charged to  paid-in-capital in excess of
par.

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations  which provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is unknown as this would  involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund.

(A) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily  available are stated at market value.  The Fund's  investments  are
valued  daily  by an  independent  pricing  service  approved  by the  Board  of
Trustees,  dealer  quotations,  or are  valued  at the  last  sale  price on the
exchange that is the primary market for such securities,  or the last quoted bid
price for those securities for which the over-the-counter  market is the primary
market for listed securities in which there were no sales.  Prices obtained from
an  independent  pricing  service use  information  provided by market makers or
estimates of market value  obtained from yield data relating to  investments  or
securities with similar  characteristics.  Short-term investments maturing in 60
days or less are valued at amortized  cost,  if their  original  maturity was 60
days or less, or by amortizing their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if
the  original  term to maturity  exceeded 60 days.  Securities  for which market
quotations are not readily available or if a  development/event  occurs that may
significantly  impact the value of the security,  may be fair valued pursuant to
guidelines  established by the Board of Trustees. The prices used by the Fund to
value  securities  may  differ  from the value  that  would be  realized  if the
securities  were sold.  The Fund's net asset  value is  determined  daily at the
close of regular  trading  (normally,  4:00 p.m.  Eastern  time) on the New York
Stock Exchange.

(B) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Investment  transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on  investments  are determined on the  identified  cost basis.  Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased  are accreted or  amortized  to interest  income over the lives of the
respective  securities using the effective  interest method.  Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date.

(C) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies.  Accordingly, no
provision  for  U.S.  federal  income  taxes  is  required.   In  addition,   by
distributing  substantially  all of its ordinary  income and  long-term  capital
gains,  if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends not to be subject to
U.S. federal excise tax.

<PAGE>


NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2004
================================================================================

(D) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--COMMON STOCK

The Fund  declares  dividends  from net  investment  income  monthly  to  common
shareholders.  Distributions  of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the  ex-dividend  date.  The amount of dividends and  distributions  from net
investment  income and net realized  capital gains are  determined in accordance
with federal income tax  regulations,  which may differ from generally  accepted
accounting  principles.  These  "book-tax"  differences  are  considered  either
temporary or permanent in nature.  To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature,  such amounts are  reclassified  within the capital accounts based on
their  federal  income  tax  treatment;  temporary  differences  do not  require
reclassification.  To the extent these  dividends  and/or  distributions  exceed
current and  accumulated  earnings  and profits for federal  income tax purposes
they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess
of par.

(E) CREDIT-LINKED TRUST CERTIFICATES

Credit-linked  trust  certificates are investments in a limited purpose trust or
other  vehicle  formed  under state law which,  in turn,  invests in a basket of
derivative  instruments,  such as credit default swaps,  interest rate swaps and
other  securities,  in order to  provide  exposure  to the high yield or another
fixed income market.

Similar to an investment in a bond,  investments  in these  credit-linked  trust
certificates  represent the right to receive  periodic  income  payments (in the
form of  distributions)  and payment of  principal at the end of the term of the
certificate.  However,  these payments are conditioned on the trust's receipt of
payments from, and the trust's potential  obligations to, the  counterparties to
the derivative instruments and other securities in which the trust invests.

(F) INTEREST RATE CAPS

In an  interest  rate cap,  one party pays a fee while the other  party pays the
excess,  if any, of a floating rate over a specified  fixed rate.  Interest rate
caps are  intended  to manage the  Fund's  exposure  to  changes  in  short-term
interest rates and hedge the Auction Preferred Shares. Owning interest rate caps
reduces the Fund's  duration,  making it less  sensitive  to changes in interest
rates from a market value perspective.  The effect on income involves protection
from rising short-term rates,  which the Fund experiences  primarily in the form
of leverage.  The Fund is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance
by the other party to the interest rate cap.

(G) CONCENTRATION OF RISK

It is the Fund's  policy to invest  the  majority  of its assets in  convertible
securities.  Although convertible  securities do derive part of their value from
that of the securities into which they are convertible,  they are not considered
derivative  financial  instruments.  However,  certain of the Fund's investments
include  features  which render them more  sensitive  to price  changes in their
underlying  securities.  Consequently,  the Fund is exposed to greater  downside
risk than traditional  convertible  securities,  but still less than that of the
underlying common stock.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER

The Fund has entered into an Investment  Management  Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager to serve as the Fund's Investment  Manager.  Subject
to the  supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees,  the Investment  Manager is
responsible for managing,  either directly or through others selected by it, the
Fund's  investment  activities  and  its  business  affairs  and  administrative
matters.  Pursuant to the  Agreement,  the Fund pays the  Investment  Manager an
annual fee, payable  monthly,  at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Fund's average
daily total managed  assets.  Total managed  assets refer to the total assets of
the Fund (including  assets  attributable to any Preferred Shares or other forms
of leverage  that may be  outstanding)  minus  accrued  liabilities  (other than
liabilities  representing  leverage).  The  Investment  Manager has retained its
affiliate,  Nicholas-Applegate  Capital Management LLC (the  "Sub-Adviser"),  to
manage the Fund's  investments.  Subject to the  supervision  of the  Investment
Manager, the Sub-Advisor makes all the Fund's investment decisions.

3. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

For the period ended June 30, 2004,  purchases and sales of  investments,  other
than short-term securities, were $2,196,549,767 and $929,844,396, respectively.

4. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The tax  character of dividends and  distributions  paid for the period July 31,
2003  (commencement  of  operations)  through June 30, 2004 of  $76,219,726  was
comprised entirely of ordinary income.

At June 30, 2004 the tax character of  distributable  earnings of $4,442,368 was
comprised entirely of ordinary income.

5. AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund has issued 4,040 shares of Preferred  Shares  Series A, 4,040 shares of
Preferred  Shares  Series B, 4,040  shares of Preferred  Shares  Series C, 4,040
shares of Preferred Shares Series D, and 4,040 shares of Preferred Shares Series
E each with a net asset and liquidation  value of $25,000 per share plus accrued
dividends.

Dividends  are  accumulated   daily  at  an  annual  rate  set  through  auction
procedures.  Distributions  of net  realized  capital  gains,  if any,  are paid
annually.

For the period ended June 30, 2004, the annualized dividend rate ranged from:

                                           High           Low       At 6/30/04
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Series A                                   1.55%         1.05%         1.55%
Series B                                   1.62%         1.03%         1.62%
Series C                                   1.49%         0.95%         1.35%
Series D                                   1.49%         1.04%         1.49%
Series E                                   1.55%         1.00%         1.55%

The Fund is subject to certain  limitations  and  restrictions  while  preferred
shares  are   outstanding.   Failure  to  comply  with  these   limitations  and
restrictions   could   preclude  the  Fund  from   declaring  any  dividends  or
distributions to common  shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share,  generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

6. SUBSEQUENT COMMON DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS

On July 1, 2004,  a  dividend  of  $0.115625  per share was  declared  to common
shareholders payable August 2, 2004 to shareholders of record on July 16, 2004.

On August 2, 2004,  a dividend  of  $0.115625  per share was  declared to common
shareholders  payable  September 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on August 13,
2004.

7. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On May 6, 2004, the Securities & Exchange  Commission (the "Commission") filed a
complaint  in the U.S.  District  Court  in the  Southern  District  of New York
alleging  that the  Investment  Manager,  certain  of its  affiliates  and their
officers had, among other things,  violated various antifraud  provisions of the
federal securities laws in connection with an alleged market-timing  arrangement
involving trading of shares of certain open-end investment  companies advised by
the Investment Manager. The complaint seeks injunctive relief, disgorgement plus
pre-judgment  interest,  monetary penalties,  and an order permanently enjoining
the  defendants  from serving as investment  advisers,  principal  underwriters,
officers,  directors,  or  members  of any  advisory  boards  to any  registered
investment  companies.  The Investment Manager and its applicable affiliates are
in  settlement  discussions  with  the  Commission  staff  with  respect  to the
Commission's complaint discussed above.

The above complaint does not allege that any  inappropriate  activity took place
with respect to the Fund and the Fund is not named in the complaint.

On June 1, 2004, the Attorney  General of the State of New Jersey announced that
it had entered into a settlement  agreement (the "New Jersey  Settlement")  with
ADAM and certain other affiliates of the Investment  Manager, in connection with
the complaint filed by the New Jersey Attorney  General on February 17, 2004. In
the New Jersey Settlement,  ADAM and other named affiliates neither admitted nor
denied the  allegations or conclusions of law, but did agree to pay New Jersey a
civil fine of $15  million and $3 million  for  investigative  costs and further
potential enforcement initiatives against unrelated parties. They also undertook
to implement  certain  governance  changes.  The  complaint  relating to the New
Jersey  Settlement  alleged,  among  other  things,  that  ADAM  and  the  other
affiliates  had failed to disclose that they  improperly  allowed  certain hedge
funds to engage in  "market  timing" in certain  open-end  investment  companies
advised or sub-advised by the Investment

================================================================================


Manager and certain of its affiliates.  The complaint sought injunctive  relief,
civil monetary penalties, restitution and disgorgement of profits.

In November  2003,  the  Commission  settled an  enforcement  action  against an
unaffiliated  broker-dealer  relating  to the  undisclosed  receipt of fees from
certain mutual fund  companies in return for preferred  marketing of their funds
and announced that it would be investigating mutual funds and their distributors
generally with respect to compensation  arrangements  (sometimes called "revenue
sharing")  relating to the sale of mutual fund shares.  In that connection,  the
Investment  Manager,  the Sub-Adviser and certain of their  affiliates are under
investigation by the Commission relating to revenue-sharing arrangements and the
use of brokerage  commissions to recognize  brokers effecting sales of series of
open-end investment companies advised by the Investment Manager, Sub-Adviser and
certain of their affiliates.  In addition,  the Attorney General of the State of
California has publicly  announced an investigation  into these funds' brokerage
recognition and revenue-sharing  arrangements.  Settlement  discussions with the
Commission  staff and the  California  Attorney  General  with  respect to these
matters  are  in  process,  and it is  possible  that  in  connection  with  any
settlements, payments will be made to the funds involved.

Since  February,  2004, the Investment  Manager,  Sub-Adviser,  certain of their
affiliates,  other investment companies advised or sub-advised by the Investment
Manager or the Sub-Adviser and their affiliates, and various other affiliates of
the foregoing  have been named as defendants in one or more of 14 lawsuits filed
in U.S.  District  Court in the  Southern  District  of New  York,  the  Central
District of California and the Districts of New Jersey and  Connecticut.  Ten of
those lawsuits  concern "market  timing," and they have been  transferred to and
consolidated  for  pre-trial  proceedings  in the U.S.  District  Court  for the
District of Maryland;  four of those lawsuits concern "revenue sharing" and have
been  consolidated  into a single  action  in the U.S.  District  Court  for the
District of  Connecticut.  The lawsuits  have been  commenced as putative  class
actions on behalf of investors  who  purchased,  held or redeemed  shares of the
applicable  investment  companies  advised  or  sub-advised  by  the  Investment
Manager, Sub-Adviser and certain of their affiliates during specified periods or
as  derivative  actions on behalf of such  investment  companies.  The  lawsuits
generally  relate  to the same  facts  that are the  subject  of the  regulatory
proceedings discussed above. The lawsuits seek, among other things,  unspecified
compensatory  damages plus interest and, in some cases,  punitive  damages,  the
rescission of investment advisory contracts, the return of fees paid under those
contracts and restitution.  The Fund, the Investment Adviser and the Sub-Adviser
believe  that other  similar  lawsuits  may be filed in federal or state  courts
naming them and/or their affiliates and employees.

Under  Section  9(a)  of the  Investment  Company  Act,  if  any of the  various
regulatory  proceedings or lawsuits were to result in a court injunction against
the Investment Manager,  Sub-Adviser, ADAM and/or certain other affiliates, they
and their  affiliates  would, in the absence of exemptive  relief granted by the
Commission, be barred from serving as an investment  adviser/sub-adviser for any
registered  investment  company,  including  the Fund.  ADAM and  certain of its
subsidiaries  have  responded to an inquiry from the  Commission  concerning the
status of the New Jersey Settlement under Section 9(a). The Investment  Manager,
ADAM and other relevant  affiliates  have determined that all those entities and
their affiliates  (including the Investment  Manager and Sub-Adviser)  will seek
exemptive  relief  from the  Commission  under  Section  9(c) of the  Investment
Company Act,  although there is no assurance that such exemptive  relief will be
granted.

In  addition,  it is  possible  that these  matters  and/or  other  developments
resulting from these matters could lead to a decrease in the market price of the
Fund's shares or other adverse  consequences  to the Fund and its  shareholders.
However,  the Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser  believe that these matters
are  not  likely  to  have a  material  adverse  effect  on the  Fund  or on the
Investment  Manager's  or  Sub-Adviser's   ability  to  perform  its  respective
investment advisory services relating to the Fund.

8. FUND CORPORATE CHANGES

On July 29, 2004, Stephen Treadway resigned as the Fund's Chairman.

CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II                    PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
================================================================================


TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF
NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  and the related  statements of operations  and of
changes  in net  assets  applicable  to common  shareholders  and the  financial
highlights present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial position of
Nicholas-Applegate  Convertible  & Income Fund II (the "Fund") at June 30, 2004,
and the results of its operations,  the changes in its net assets  applicable to
common  shareholders  and the financial  highlights for the period July 31, 2003
(commencement  of  operations)   through  June  30,  2004,  in  conformity  with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  These
financial  statements  and  financial  highlights   (hereafter  referred  to  as
"financial  statements") are the  responsibility of the Fund's  management;  our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audit.  We conducted our audit of these  financial  statements in accordance
with auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States),  which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audit,   which  included   confirmation  of  securities  at  June  30,  2004  by
correspondence  with the custodian and brokers,  provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II       DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
(unaudited)
================================================================================


Pursuant  to the Fund's  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan (the  "Plan"),  all Common
Shareholders  whose  shares  are  registered  in their own  names  will have all
dividends,  including any capital gain dividends,  reinvested  automatically  in
additional Common Shares by PFPC Inc., as agent for the Common Shareholders (the
"Plan  Agent"),  unless the  shareholder  elects to receive cash. An election to
receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at the option of the  shareholder.  In
the case of record  shareholders  such as banks,  brokers or other nominees that
hold Common Shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will
administer  the Plan on the basis of the number of Common Shares  certified from
time to  time  by the  record  shareholder  as  representing  the  total  amount
registered  in such  shareholder's  name and held for the account of  beneficial
owners who are to participate in the Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in
the name of a bank, broker or nominee should contact the bank, broker or nominee
for details.  All distributions to investors who elect not to participate in the
Plan (or whose broker or nominee  elects not to  participate  on the  investor's
behalf),  will be paid cash by check mailed, in the case of direct  shareholder,
to the record holder by PFPC Inc., as the Fund's dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your broker or nominee)  elects not to  participate  in the Plan,
the number of Common Shares you will receive will be determined as follows:

(1) If Common  Shares  are  trading at or above net asset  value on the  payment
    date,  the Fund will  issue new  shares at the  greater of (i) the net asset
    value per Common  Share on the payment  date or (ii) 95% of the market price
    per Common Share on the payment  date;  or

(2) If  Common  Shares  are  trading  below  net asset  value  (minus  estimated
    brokerage  commissions  that would be incurred  upon the  purchase of Common
    Shares on the open market) on the payment date,  the Plan Agent will receive
    the dividend or  distribution in cash and will purchase Common Shares in the
    open  market,  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange  or  elsewhere,  for  the
    participants'  accounts. It is possible that the market price for the Common
    Shares  may  increase  before the Plan Agent has  completed  its  purchases.
    Therefore,  the average  purchase price per share paid by the Plan Agent may
    exceed the market  price on the payment  date,  resulting in the purchase of
    fewer  shares than if the dividend or  distribution  had been paid in Common
    Shares  issued  by the  Fund.  The Plan  Agent  will use all  dividends  and
    distributions  received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open market
    on or  shortly  after  the  payment  date,  but in no event  later  than the
    ex-dividend date for the next distribution. Interest will not be paid on any
    uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw  from the Plan at any time by giving  notice to the Plan Agent.
If you withdraw or the Plan is  terminated,  you will receive a certificate  for
each  whole  share in your  account  under the Plan and you will  receive a cash
payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish, the Plan Agent
will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage commissions.

The Plan  Agent  maintains  all  shareholders'  accounts  in the Plan and  gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts,  including information
you may need for tax  records.  The Plan Agent will also furnish each person who
buys Common  Shares with  written  instructions  detailing  the  procedures  for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive  distributions in
cash.  Common  Shares  in  your  account  will  be held  by the  Plan  Agent  in
non-certificated  form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares you
have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in  Common  Shares.  However,  all  participants  will pay a pro  rata  share of
brokerage  commissions  incurred  by the Plan Agent  when it makes  open  market
purchases.

Automatically  reinvested  dividends  and  distributions  are  taxed in the same
manner as cash dividends and distributions.

The Fund and the Plan Agent  reserve the right to amend or  terminate  the Plan.
There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund
reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service  charge payable by the
participants.  Additional  information  about the Plan may be obtained  from the
Fund's transfer agent,  PFPC Inc.,  P.O. Box 43027,  Providence,  RI 02940-3027,
telephone number 1-800-331-1710.

            audit services by the Auditor for the Registrant, as well as the
            Auditor's engagements for non-audit services to the when the
            engagement relates directly to the operations and financial
            reporting of the Registrant. The Registrant's policy is stated
            below.

            NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CONVERTIBLE & INCOME FUND II (THE "FUND")

AUDIT OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE POLICY FOR PRE-APPROVAL OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY
THE INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

The Fund's Audit Oversight Committee ("Committee") is charged with the oversight
of the Funds' financial reporting policies and practices and their internal
controls. As part of this responsibility, the Committee must pre-approve any
independent accounting firm's engagement to render audit and/or permissible
non-audit services, as required by law. In evaluating a
proposed engagement by the independent accountants, the Committee will assess
the effect that the engagement might reasonably be expected to have on the
accountant's independence. The Committee's evaluation will be based on:

   a review of the nature of the professional services expected to provided,

   the fees to be charged in connection with the services expected to be
   provided,

   a review of the safeguards put into place by the accounting firm to
   safeguard independence, and

   periodic meetings with the accounting firm.

POLICY FOR AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO THE FUND

On an annual basis, the Fund's Committee will review and pre-approve the scope
of the audit of the Fund and proposed audit fees and permitted non-audit
(including audit-related) services that may be performed by the
Fund independent accountants. At least annually, the Committee will receive a
report of all audit and non-audit services that were rendered in the previous
calendar year pursuant to this Policy. In addition to the Committee's
pre-approval of services pursuant to this Policy, the engagement of the
independent accounting firm for any permitted non-audit service provided to the
Fund will also require the separate written pre-approval of the President of
the Fund, who will confirm, independently, that the accounting firms's
engagement will not adversely affect the firm's independence. All non-audit
services performed by the independent accounting firm will be disclosed, as
required, in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

AUDIT SERVICES

The categories of audit services and related fees to be reviewed and
pre-approved annually by the Committee are:

   Annual Fund financial statement audits
   Seed audits (related to new product filings, as required)
   SEC and regulatory filings and consents
   Semiannual financial statement reviews

AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

The following categories of audit-related services are considered to be
consistent with the role of the Fund's independent accountants and services

<PAGE>

falling under one of these categories will be pre-approved by the Committee on
an annual basis if the Committee deems those services to be consistent with the
accounting firm's independence:

   Accounting consultations
   Fund merger support services
   Agreed upon procedure reports (inclusive of quarterly review of Basic
      Maintenance testing associated with issuance of Preferred Shares and
      semiannual report review)
   Other attestation reports
   Comfort letters
   Other internal control reports

Individual audit-related services that fall within one of these categories and
are not presented to the Committee as part of the annual pre-approval process
described above, may be pre-approved, if deemed consistent with the accounting
firm's independence, by the Committee Chair (or any other Committee member who
is a disinterested trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this
responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated fee for those
services does not exceed $75,000. Any such pre-approval shall be reported to the
full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

TAX SERVICES

The following categories of tax services are considered to be consistent with
the role of the Funds' independent accountants and services falling under one of
these categories will be pre-approved by the Committee on an annual basis if the
Committee deems those services to be consistent with the accounting firm's
independence:

   Tax compliance services related to the filing or amendment of the following:
      Federal, state and local income tax compliance; and, sales and use tax
         compliance

above, may be pre-approved, if deemed consistent with the accounting firm's
independence, by the Committee Chairman (or any other Committee member who is a
disinterested trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this
responsibility has been delegated) so long as the estimated
fee for those services does not exceed $75,000. Any such pre-approval shall be
reported to the full Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

PROSCRIBED SERVICES

The Funds' independent accountants will not render services in the following
categories of non-audit services:

   Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial
      statements of the Funds
   Financial information systems design and implementation
   Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or
      contribution-in-kind reports

<PAGE>

   Management functions or human resources
   Broker or dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services
   Legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit
   Any other service that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
       determines, by regulation, is impermissible

PRE-APPROVAL OF NON-AUDIT SERVICES PROVIDED TO OTHER ENTITIES WITHIN THE FUND
COMPLEX

The Committee will pre-approve annually any permitted non-audit services to be
provided to PA Fund Management LLC (Formerly, PIMCO Advisors Fund Management
LLC) or any other investment manager to the Funds (but not including any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted
by the investment manager) (the "Investment Manager") and any entity
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investment Manager
that provides ongoing services to the Funds (including affiliated sub-advisers
to the Funds), provided, in each case, that the engagement relates directly to
the operations and financial reporting of the Funds (such entities, including
the Investment Manager, shall be referred to herein as the "Accounting
Affiliates"). Individual projects that are not presented to the Committee as
part of the annual pre-approval process, may be pre-approved, if deemed
consistent with the accounting firm's independence, by the Committee Chairman
(or any other Committee member who is a disinterested trustee under the
Investment Company Act to whom this responsibility has been delegated) so long
as the estimated fee for those services does not exceed $100,000. Any such
pre-approval shall be reported to the full Committee at its next regularly
scheduled meeting.

Although the Committee will not pre-approve all services provided to the
Investment Manager and its affiliates, the Committee will receive an annual
report from the Funds' independent accounting firm showing the aggregate fees
for all services provided to the Investment Manager and its affiliates.

DE MINIMUS EXCEPTION TO REQUIREMENT OF PRE-APPROVAL OF NON-AUDIT SERVICES

With respect to the provision of permitted non-audit services to a Fund or
Accounting Affiliates, the pre-approval requirement is waived if:

    (1) The aggregate amount of all such permitted non-audit services provided
        constitutes no more than (i) with respect to such services provided to
        the Fund, five percent (5%) of the total amount of revenues paid by the
        Fund to its independent accountant during the fiscal year in which the
        services are provided, and(ii) with respect to such services provided to
        Accounting Affiliates, five percent (5%)of the total amount of revenues
        paid to the Fund's independent accountant by the Fund and the Accounting
        Affiliates during the fiscal year in which the services are provided;

    (2) Such services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the
        engagement for such services to be non-audit services; and

    (3) Such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Committee and
        approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Committee or by the
        Committee Chairman (or any other Committee member who is a disinterested
        trustee under the Investment Company Act to whom this Committee Chairman
        or other delegate shall be reported to the full Committee at its next
        regularly scheduled meeting.

<PAGE>


    e)2)No services were approved pursuant to the procedures contained in
        paragraph (C) (7) (i) (C) of Rule 2-01 of Registration S-X.

    f)  Not applicable

    g)  Non-audit fees. The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the Auditor for
        services rendered to the Registrant, and rendered to the Adviser, for
        the 2004 Reporting Period was $4,053,640.

    h)  Auditor Independence. The Registrant's Audit Oversight Committee has
        considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
        rendered to the Adviser which were not pre-approved is compatible with
        maintaining the Auditor's independence.

    CODE OF ETHICS PURSUANT TO SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
              FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

                               SEPTEMBER 16, 2003

I.    COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

      This Code of Ethics (this "Code") pursuant to Section 406 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has been adopted by the registered investment
companies (each a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds") listed on Exhibit A and
applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer
and Principal Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers" each of whom is
identified in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

      o  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

      o  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that a Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities and
         Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by
         a Fund;

      o  compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

      o  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

      o  accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to conflicts of
interest.

II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ANY ACTUAL OR APPARENT CONFLICTS
      OF INTEREST

      OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the relevant Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal benefits as a
result of the Covered Officer's position with the relevant Fund.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the relevant Fund and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions

<PAGE>


and procedures in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (including the regulations
thereunder, the "1940 Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (including
the regulations thereunder, the "Investment Advisers Act"). Indeed, conflicts of
interest are endemic for certain registered management investment companies and
those conflicts are both substantially and procedurally dealt with under the
1940 Act. For example, Covered Officers may not engage in certain transactions
with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of such Fund. The
compliance program of each Fund and the compliance programs of its investment
advisers (including sub-advisers), principal underwriter and administrator or
sub-administrator (each a "Service Provider" and, collectively, the "Service
Providers") are reasonably designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of many of those provisions, although they are not designed to
provide absolute assurance as to those matters. This Code does not, and is not
intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts
fall outside of the parameters of this Code. See also Section V of this Code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Fund and its Service Providers of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether for the Funds or
for a Service Provider, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Service Providers
and the Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationships between the Funds and their Service
Providers and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of
their duties as officers of the relevant Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act, other
applicable law and the relevant Fund's constitutional documents, such activities
will be deemed to have been handled ethically. Frequently, the 1940 Act
establishes, as a mechanism for dealing with conflicts, disclosure to and
approval by the Directors/Trustees of a Fund who are not "interested persons" of
such Fund under the 1940 Act. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards
of Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers
or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes and that such service, by itself, does not give rise to a conflict of
interest.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not the subject of provisions of the 1940 Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should bear in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the relevant Fund, unless the personal interest has been disclosed
to and approved by other officers of such Fund or such Fund's Board or a
committee of such Fund's Board that has no such personal interest.

                                       -2-
<PAGE>


      Each Covered Officer must not:

      o  use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
         influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the relevant
         Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
         detriment of such Fund;

      o  cause the relevant Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit such Fund; or

      o  retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
         Funds or their Service Providers for reports of potential violations
         that are made in good faith.

      There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved by the President of the relevant Fund (or, with respect to activities
of the President, by the Chairman of the relevant Fund). These conflict of
interest situations are listed below:

      o  service on the board of directors or governing board of a publicly
         traded entity;

      o  acceptance of any investment opportunity or of any material gift or
         gratuity from any person or entity that does business, or desires to do
         business, with the relevant Fund. For these purposes, material gifts do
         not include (i) gifts from a single giver so long as their aggregate
         annual value does not exceed the equivalent of $100.00 or (ii)
         attending business meals, business related conferences, sporting events
         and other entertainment events at the expense of a giver, so long as
         the expense is reasonable and both the Covered Person and the giver are
         present.(1)

      o  any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
         with, any entities doing business with the relevant Fund, other than a
         Service Provider or an affiliate of a Service Provider. This
         restriction shall not apply to or otherwise limit the ownership of
         publicly traded securities so long as the Covered Person's ownership
         does not exceed more than 2% of the outstanding securities of the
         relevant class.

      o  a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
         charges or spreads paid by the relevant Fund for effecting portfolio
         transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
         arising from the Covered Officer's employment with a Service Provider
         or its affiliate. This restriction shall not apply to or otherwise
         limit the ownership of

                                      -3-
<PAGE>


         publicly traded securities so long as the Covered Person's ownership
         does not exceed more than 2% of the particular class of security
         outstanding.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

      o  no Covered Officer should knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
         misrepresent, facts about the relevant Fund to others, whether within
         or outside such Fund, including to such Fund's Board and auditors, and
         to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

      o  each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
         of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
         Funds and the Service Providers or with counsel to the Funds with the
         goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
         disclosure in the registration statements or periodic reports that the
         Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC (which, for sake of clarity,
         does not include any sales literature, omitting prospectuses, or
         "tombstone" advertising prepared by the relevant Fund's principal
         underwriter(s)); and

      o  it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
         with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
         and regulations.

IV.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

      Each Covered Officer must:

      o  upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the relevant Fund that he has
         received, read, and understands the Code;

      o  provide full and fair responses to all questions asked in any Trustee
         and Officer Questionnaire provided by the relevant Fund as well as with
         respect to any supplemental request for information; and

      o  notify the President of the relevant Fund promptly if he is convinced
         to a moral certainty that there has been a material violation of this
         Code (with respect to violations by a President, the Covered Officer
         shall report to the Chairman of the relevant Fund).

      The President of each Fund is responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any
approvals or waivers sought by the President will be considered by the Chairman
of the relevant Fund.

      The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

                                      -4-
<PAGE>


      o  the President will take all appropriate action to investigate any
         potential material violations reported to him, which actions may
         include the use of internal or external counsel, accountants or other
         personnel;

      o  if, after such investigation, the President believes that no material
         violation has occurred, the President is not required to take any
         further action;

      o  any matter that the President believes is a material violation will be
         reported to the Committee;

      o  if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it
         will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider
         appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
         modifications to applicable policies and procedures; notification to
         appropriate personnel of a Service Provider or its board; or a
         recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

      o  the Committee will be authorized to grant waivers, as it deems
         appropriate; and

      o  any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds or the Funds' Service Providers govern or
purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are
subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they
conflict with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their Service
Providers's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and the Service
Providers's more detailed compliance policies and procedures are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.

VI.   AMENDMENTS

      Any material amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board.

VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone except as permitted by the Board.

                                      -5-

VIII. INTERNAL USE

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

I, Brian S. Shlissel, certify that:

1.  I have reviewed this report on the Form N-CSR of the Nicholas- Applegate
    Convertible & Income Fund II;

2.  Based on my knowledge, the report does not contain any untrue statement of a
    material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
    statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
    were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by the report;

3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
    information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects
    the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and
    cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement
    of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods in this report:

4.  The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
    establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
    in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
    control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

        (a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
            disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
            supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
            registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
            to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
            period in which this report is being prepared:

        (b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
            such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

            statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
            accepted accounting principles:

        (c) Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
            and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about
            the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
            date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on
            such evaluation; and

        (d) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal

                           HOW THE FUNDS VOTE PROXIES

The Funds' Investment Adviser votes proxies on behalf of the Funds pursuant to
written Proxy Policy Guidelines and Procedures ("Proxy Guidelines") adopted by
the Funds. A summary of the Proxy Guidelines is provided below. To obtain
information on how your Fund's securities were voted, please contact your
account representative at 1-800-551-8043.

                     NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
                              PROXY VOTING SUMMARY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                REVISED 10/10/03

Nicholas-Applegate Capital Management takes seriously the responsibility of
voting proxies on behalf of our clients. Our policies and procedures are
designed to meet all applicable fiduciary standards and to protect the rights
and enhance the economic welfare of those to whom we owe a fiduciary duty.

A Proxy Committee, including executive, investment, sales, marketing, compliance
and operations personnel, is responsible for establishing our policies and
procedures. The Committee reviews these policies and procedures on a regular
basis and makes such changes as it believes are necessary. Our guidelines and
voting actions are to a large extent aligned with the voting recommendations of
Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), a third-party proxy voting service
to which we subscribe.

We review all proxies for which we have voting responsibility, and vote all
proxies according to our written guidelines, taking into account ISS
recommendations and/or investment team input. Our guidelines address such
general areas as elections of directors and auditors, corporate defenses,
corporate governance, mergers and acquisitions, corporate restructuring, state
of incorporation, proxy contest issues, executive compensation, employee
considerations and social issue proposals.

The guidelines contained herein reflect our normal voting position on certain
issues, and will not apply in every situation. The guidelines are intended to
generally cover both U.S. and international proxy voting, although due to
country differences and requirements, international proxy voting may differ
depending on individual facts and circumstances. Some issues require a
case-by-case analysis prior to voting and, in those situations, input from our
investment team will normally be solicited. Even when our guidelines specify how
we normally vote on particular issues, we may change the vote if it is
reasonably determined to be in our clients best interest. In addition, on client
request, we may vote proxies for that client in a particular manner overall,
such as union or labor sensitive.

To ensure that voting responsibilities are met, the Committee has established
operational procedures to have client proxies reconciled against client
holdings. The procedures are also intended to ensure that proxies are voted
consistent with voting guidelines, that the best proxy analysis is used for each
issue, and all votes are recorded

<PAGE>


and justified. Any variance from stated policy is carefully noted, including the
reason for the variance.

We maintain proxy voting records for all accounts and make these records
available to clients at their request.

H.  CONFLICT OF INTEREST

    When facing conflicts between our interests and the interests of our
    clients, Nicholas-Applegate will always act in the best interests of its
    clients. In proxy voting matters, conflicts of interest can arise in many
    ways. For example, a proxy issue could arise for one of our public clients
    that we also own in one or more client accounts. Or, a potential client
    battling a contentious shareholder proposal may ask for our vote in exchange
    for granting us an investment mandate. In these cases and other potential
    conflict scenarios, Nicholas-Applegate must exercise caution to ensure our
    clients' interests are not compromised.

    We believe a reasonable process to screen for potential conflicts that could
    influence our proxy voting is as follows:

      (i)   identify any situation where we DO NOT intend to vote in accordance
            with our normal policy on any issue;

                                       9
<PAGE>


      (ii)  determine who is directing (portfolio manager, client, etc) us to
            vote contrary to our normal policy;

      (iii) review and analyze for potential conflict issues (e.g., may
            require PM to disclose any relationship with the issuer via a
            written questionnaire);

      (iv)  Proxy Committee to review request to vote contrary to policy, and
            potential conflict if any, prior to voting, and will make final
            decision.

      (v)   pursuant to the request of the Board of Trustees of the
            Nicholas-Applegate Institutional Funds, NACM will report to the
            Board any conflict of interest matter and how the Committee resolved
            it.

    The Proxy Committee will be responsible for implementing and following the
    above process, and has the flexibility to use its reasonable judgment in
    determining which steps are necessary under each set of circumstances.
