Dear ZTR Shareholder:

   I am pleased to share with you the manager's report and commentary for The
Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2006.

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value increased 2.24% in the fourth
quarter of 2006, including $0.129 in reinvested distributions. During the same
period, the Benchmark Index for The Zweig Total Return Fund gained 3.01%,
including reinvested dividends. The Fund's overall exposure to the bond and
equity markets for the quarter was approximately 96%.

   For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Fund's net asset value gained
7.29%, including reinvested distributions. For the same period, the Benchmark
Index for The Zweig Total Return Fund increased 7.98%, including reinvested
dividends. The Fund's overall exposure to the bond and equity markets for the
year was approximately 96%.

              Sincerely,

              /s/ George R. Aylward
              George R. Aylward
              President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
              The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc.

                          MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

   The Fund's bond exposure on December 31, 2006 was 59%, unchanged from its
position on September 30. Average duration (a measure of sensitivity to
interest rates) was 6.3 years at year-end, versus 6.4 years at the close of the
third quarter. If we were fully invested, 62.5% of our portfolio would be in
bonds and 37.5% in stocks. Consequently, with 59% in bonds, we remain in about
94% of a full position (59%/62.5%).

   The bond market featured two distinct periods in 2006. Yields on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose dramatically in the first half of the
year, from 4.39% to a high in late June of nearly 5.25% -- then fell sharply
over the second half to a low of 4.42% in early December. The 10-year note
ended the year at 4.70%, meaning that the bond market posted a small positive
return in 2006, when investors added the coupon yield to the slightly negative
price return.

   It was a difficult year to follow any trend. The Federal Reserve (the "Fed")
tightened four times in the first half from a federal funds rate of 4.25% to
5.25%, then elected to hold steady for the remaining half of 2006. Uncertainty
about Fed policy, combined with volatile commodity markets and global political
events, created a challenging environment for bond investors.

   U.S. economic data also showed mixed signals throughout the year. At times
inflation seemed under control, while at other times, higher oil prices, a weak
dollar and spikes in some commodities created nervousness. The fourth quarter
provided a fitting ending to the year. It saw bond yields gyrate higher for
most of October before plummeting late in the month. They dipped further in
November to the lowest yields since January, only to get pushed higher again in
December on stronger-than-expected jobs data and inflation.

<PAGE>



   Overall, we are satisfied with the fixed income performance of the Fund for
the year. We held a slightly defensive position for most of the first half and
used the sell-off in June to increase our bond exposure. The fixed income
portion of the Fund ultimately did add to the return for the year. While we
cannot predict the future, it seems that most commodities, and particularly oil
prices, have begun to trend lower, which would be somewhat supportive of lower
bond yields and, consequently, higher bond prices. However, seasonally, the
first quarter has not been kind to bonds in recent history, so some caution is
warranted.

   Our bond model, which had been relatively neutral, increased recently and
has been trending somewhat more positive. Our bond exposure, specifically our
duration, is higher than neutral. At this writing, we anticipate lower yields
ahead. As always, we remain flexible and will stick to the dictates of our
research which, given the recent volatility in the bond market, seems prudent.

   Our exposure to U.S. common stocks was 33% on December 31, 2006, up slightly
from 35% at the end of the third quarter. At this level, we are at about 93% of
a full position (35%/37.5%).

   After setting dozens of record highs from the start of October until the
year-end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average/SM/ (the Dow) ended 2006 at
12,463.15 -- an increase of 16.3% for the year and fewer than 50 points from
the peak of 12,510.57 touched on December 27. For the year, the Nasdaq
Composite(R) Index (the Nasdaq) gained 9.5% to 2,415.29 and the S&P 500(R)
Index (the S&P 500) climbed 13.6% to 1,418.30. Overall, it was the best year
for the markets since 2003 --when the Dow rose 25.3%, the Nasdaq soared 50%,
and the S&P 500 was up 26.4%.

   Most of the gain came in the fourth quarter, after it became apparent that
the Fed had decided to keep its rate increases at bay. We believe that the
election was a positive factor for the market. Ordinarily, the market prefers
the Republicans to win, but the market started to perk up even when it was
quite likely the Democrats would control the House and, in all likelihood, the
Senate. We like the fact that the market was acting well on supposedly bad
news. After the election, the market continued to climb. Perhaps investors
wanted political gridlock with a Republican president and a Democratic
congress. Another factor for the strong run was the takeover rush. There was a
large amount of cash circulating that was winding up in the market.

   As it had done in its last three previous meetings, the Fed left its
short-term interest rate unchanged at 5.25% at its December session. In its
statement, the Fed noted that economic growth had slowed partly, "...reflecting
a substantial cooling of the housing market..." and saw the economy expanding
at a moderate pace in coming quarters. While the Fed noted, "...inflation
pressures seem likely to moderate over time," it simultaneously warned that,
"...some inflation risks remain." It added that, "...the extent and timing of
additional firming..." will depend on "...the evolution of the outlook for both
inflation and economic growth."

   On the inflation front, the main factor is the drop in commodity prices,
especially that of crude oil. It has fallen about a third from its peak. The
higher oil prices had put a crimp in the economy, and the lower levels could be
a stimulant, leading to inflationary trends. Probably that is what gives the
Fed concern. However, at this point, it is not something we are worried about.

   The housing slump and slower vehicle sales were factors in the cooling of
the gross domestic product (GDP) annual growth rate from a robust 5.6% in the
first quarter of 2006 to 2% in the third quarter, according to the Commerce
Department. The slower growth was accompanied by mixed news on inflationary
pressures. Consumer prices were unchanged in November, following 0.5% declines
in both September and October, while producer prices rose 2%.

   Right now, the economy and inflation seem to be roughly in balance. The
economy is decent but not strong and inflation seems in control. We believe
that overall, the situation is close to the so-called "Goldilocks" scenario
where the market is not too hot or too cold.

   Part of the recent strength in the stock market has been attributed to the
flood of mergers and acquisitions. Thomson Financial reports that the value of
deals in the U.S. jumped 36% in 2006 to $1.56 trillion. This figure is close to
the record $1.7 trillion set in 2000.

   Takeover firms have done fairly well and have been able to raise more and
more money. It is money that makes the market go and institutional money has
been pouring in. We have heard numbers that are north of a trillion dollars
that they now have under their control. The amount of cash held by corporations
is probably close to double what was normal a decade ago. After the recession
and 9/11, corporations became timid and hoarded their cash. Since they aren't
spending as much on capital equipment, they have to do something with the
funds. Some increased their dividends; others bought back their stock; still
others bought another company. These are all bullish moves.

   While we believe there is a correlation between merger mania and market
highs, we are not likely at that point yet. There is so much money out there
ready to be put to work and the market is not wildly valued either. Eventually,
it could get out of bounds and then we would have to pay the piper. But we
believe it is too early to worry about that.

   Also making news last year was the surge in initial public offerings (IPOs).
Dialogic reported that 78 new issues came out in the U.S. during the final
three months of 2006, raising $16.68 billion, the highest total since the final
quarter of 1999. This was a substantial gain from the 48 stocks that raised
$7.6 billion in the same time frame in 2005. For all of 2006, there were 198
newly listed companies that raised $44.1 billion.

   Although the number is huge, we do not consider it to be out of control.
This is not 1999. We're not seeing the clunky ones, the start-ups without
earnings that triple on the first day. Although the IPOs' growth trend will
continue, we do not consider the current amount unusually large.

   As more new issues were coming out, more companies were buying back their
own stock. Standard & Poor's reported that companies in the S&P 500 bought back
an estimated $110 billion of their stock in the third quarter of 2006. This
followed $117 billion buybacks in the second quarter and $110 billion in the
first. All told, the nine-month total was $337 billion, an increase of 33% from
the $245 billion in the same period in 2005.

   These buybacks are another bullish factor. The real question when the
company buys back its own stock is whether it is reasonably priced or cheap.
Back in the late '90s, some companies were buying in their own stock at
multiples we felt were inappropriate. But now the market does not seem to be
too lofty on a valuation basis. Some companies are probably overpaying, but on
average, valuations seem fine overall.

   Incidentally, a significant reason for the buyback is that companies don't
want to be taken over. If they sit on a mountain of cash, they are likely to
become a target. Conversely, if they buy their own stock, they have less cash
and tend to be less attractive for a takeover. With buybacks, they are also
seeking to raise the price of their stock. We believe the trend of stock
buybacks as a defense against takeovers will continue.


                                      3

   Although remaining respectable, corporate earnings are expected to slow
their growth rate. Standard & Poor's estimated that companies in its 500-Stock
Index in the fourth quarter of 2006 were 9% above the 2005 figure. After 18
consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, this would be the first quarter
with a single-digit gain. Earnings in the third quarter were at an
exceptionally strong 19%. Looking ahead, Thomson Financial predicts that
earnings per share for these companies will slip below 10% in 2007, making this
year the first since 2002 with single-digit growth. That would still be above
the long-term average growth of 7.5%.

   Forecasts of lower earnings are made in advance of every quarter and they
frequently turn out to be too low. It is difficult to know whether the overall
growth rate will slow. Every industry has a different outlook. For example, the
drop in oil prices will help many companies, but hurt the oil companies, which
represent a major market sector. Without making any predictions, we don't see
earnings running off the track soon.

   The dollar slipped sharply in 2006 against the euro and the British pound.
The euro gained 11.49% and the British pound, 13.8%. Both were close to record
highs against the dollar. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Index of stocks outside the
U.S. climbed 23% in 2006. The strong markets abroad and the cheaper dollar are
combining to make foreign stocks more attractive to U.S. investors as far as
potential appreciation, capital gains and dividends are concerned. That's why
such a tremendous amount of money is pouring into foreign funds. However, these
investments are, of course, not guaranteed. If the dollar reverses its course,
these investors could get hurt. That will likely happen eventually, but it is
impossible to predict when.

   At year-end, companies in the S&P 500 were trading at 18.2 times operating
earnings, slightly above the 17.9 valuation in September, but below the 19.2
figure at the close of 2005. Data from Thomson Financial placed the
price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 in 2007 at about 15 times estimated
earnings. This coincides with the long-term average. There are analysts who
believe the market is undervalued, but we don't consider the current levels to
be that unreasonable. Given the state of the economy and the inflation level,
the market appears to us to be fairly valued.

   Indicating that many investors borrowed money to buy stocks during the
market rally, margin debt, as reported by Ned Davis Research, increased 21%
from February through November. At the end of November, margin debt was put at
2% of GDP, the highest percentage since November 2000. Much of the margin surge
is due to hedge fund borrowing and these funds are under-invested. What we are
not seeing at this time is the public plunging heavily into margin and later
running into trouble.

   There has been mounting concern about the long-running inverted yield curve,
with yields on short-term U.S. Treasury bills topping returns on long-term
Treasury notes. In early January, the three-month Treasury bill yielded 5.05%
against a 4.648% rate on the 10-year note. This inversion had continued for
about six months and, historically, recessions have frequently caused long-term
inversions.

   The yield curve used to be one of our favorite indicators, but times have
changed. In the past, banks had limits on their loans and the economy would
slow when the Fed raised interest rates. There are no such restrictions on
banks now and the current inversion occurred because the bond market did very
well.

   Market advisers are very optimistic on the outlook. The year-end survey by
Investors Intelligence showed 56% bulls and 20% bears. This was a significant
increase from the end of the third quarter, when bulls stood at 49% and bears
at 33% -- but not very different from the 2005 year-end, when there were 56%
bulls and 24% bears. While there definitely is a lot more optimism in the
marketplace than there was a few


                                      4

<PAGE>


months ago, the level of optimism is still relatively subdued. For example,
many analysts are predicting that the market will rise about 7% for this year,
which is pretty normal.

   In summary, the biggest positives for the market in 2006 included the
previously discussed large levels of cash held by corporations, hedge funds and
buyout companies. In addition, we are now in a pre-election year -- which,
historically, has often proven to be the strongest year in the four-year
presidential cycle -- a fact that should not be overlooked.

   Although all sorts of negative things are happening around the world, the
market keeps going up. It is climbing the proverbial wall of worry and is doing
a pretty good job. All things considered, our market stance on equities is
bullish.

              Sincerely,

                                                  [GRAPHIC]

(1)Closing Price -- New York Stock Exchange.
(2)Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of a share of the
   Fund's common stock at the opening NYSE share price on the first business
   day and a sale at the closing NYSE share price on the last business day of
   each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
   the purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
   the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Generally, total
   investment return based on net asset value will be higher than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is an
   increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value to
   the net assets from the beginning to the end of such years. Conversely,
   total investment return based on net asset value will be lower than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is a decrease
   in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net
   asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               December 31, 2006

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988. The Fund's objective is to seek the highest total
return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income, consistent with
the preservation of capital.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

  A. Security Valuation:

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price.

   Debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or valuations
provided by a pricing service, which utilizes information with respect to
recent sales, market transactions in comparable securities, quotations from
dealers, and various relationships between securities in determining value.

   As required, some securities and other assets may be valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Directors.

   Certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where closing
prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily
available market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement in
the U.S. securities market, or other regional and local developments) may occur
between the time that foreign markets close (where the security is principally
traded) and the time that the Fund calculates its net asset value (generally,
the close of the NYSE) that may impact the value of securities traded in these
foreign markets. In these cases, information from an external vendor may be
utilized to adjust closing market prices of certain foreign common stocks to
reflect their fair value. Because the frequency of significant events is not
predictable, fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a
frequent basis.

   Short-term investments having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market.

                                      17

<PAGE>



   In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
"Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.

  B. Security Transactions and Related Income:

   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign securities,
as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective
interest method. Realized gains and losses are determined on the identified
cost basis.

  C. Income Taxes:

   It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes or excise taxes
has been made.

   The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on investments or
currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable. The Fund will
accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon current
interpretations of the tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which they invest.

   In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes."
This standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax-return
positions in the financial statements as "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained
by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the
more-likely-than-not criterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than
50 percent likely to be realized. FIN 48 is effective as of the beginning of
the first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2006, with early application
permitted if no interim financial statements have been issued. At adoption,
companies must adjust their financial statements to reflect only those tax
positions that are more likely-than-not to be sustained as of the adoption
date. The evaluation of the impact that will result from adopting FIN 48 is in
progress.

  D. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders:

   Distributions are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These differences may include the treatment of
non-taxable dividends, market premium and discount, non-deductible expenses,
expiring capital loss carryovers, foreign currency gain or loss, operating
losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. Permanent book and tax basis
differences relating to shareholder distributions will result in
reclassifications to capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest. As of
December 31, 2006, the Fund increased undistributed net investment income by
$29,476,927, decreased the accumulated net realized loss by $4,791,866, and
decreased capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest by $34,268,793.

   The components of distributable earnings on a tax basis (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) which is disclosed in the Schedules of
Investments and Securities Sold Short) consist of undistributed ordinary income
of $0 and undistributed long-term capital gains of $0.

                                      18

<PAGE>



   The Fund has $21,681,438 of capital loss carryovers, $16,906,512 expiring in
2010 and $4,774,926 expiring in 2011, which may be used to offset future
capital gains. The Fund may not realize the benefit of these losses to the
extent it does not realize gains on investments prior to the expiration of the
capital loss carryovers. For the fiscal year (the "period") ended December 31,
2006, the Fund utilized losses deferred in prior years of $6,099,018.

   In addition, under certain conditions, the Fund may lose the benefit of
these losses to the extent that distributions to shareholders exceed required
distribution amounts as defined under the Internal Revenue Code. Shareholders
may also pay additional taxes on these excess distributions.

  E. Foreign Currency Translation:

   Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from changes
in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market prices of
securities.

  F. Foreign Security Country Determination:

   A combination of the following criteria is used to assign the countries of
risk listed in the Schedule of Investments and Securities Sold Short: country
of incorporation, actual building address, primary exchange on which the
security is traded and country in which the greatest percentage of company
revenue is generated.

  G. Options:

   The Fund may write covered options or purchase options contracts for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the market value of the underlying
securities or foreign currencies.

   The Fund will realize a gain or loss upon the expiration or closing of the
option transaction. Gains and losses on written options are reported separately
in the Statement of Operations. When a written option is exercised, the
proceeds on sales or amounts paid are adjusted by the amount of premium
received. Options written are reported as a liability in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current
value of the option. The risk associated with written options is that the
change in value of options contracts may not correspond to the change in value
of the hedged instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the
value of the underlying instruments, or if a liquid, secondary market does not
exist for the contracts.

   The Fund may purchase options, which are included in the Fund's Schedule of
Investments and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of
the option.

   When a purchased option is exercised, the cost of the security is adjusted
by the amount of premium paid. The risk associated with purchased options is
limited to the premium paid.

                                      19

<PAGE>



  H. Short Sales:

   A short sale is a transaction in which the Fund sells a security it does not
own in anticipation of a decline in market price. To sell a security short, the
Fund must borrow the security. The Fund's obligation to replace the security
borrowed and sold short will be fully collateralized at all times by the
proceeds from the short sale retained by the broker and by cash and securities
deposited in a segregated account with the Fund's custodian. If the price of
the security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the
time the Fund replaces the borrowed security, the Fund will realize a loss, and
if the price declines during the period, the Fund will realize a gain. Any
realized gain will be decreased, and any realized loss increased, by the amount
of transaction costs. On ex-dividend date, dividends on short sales are
recorded as an expense to the Fund. The collateral includes the deposits with
the broker for securities held short and the value of the segregated
investments held long, as shown in the Schedule of Investments and Securities
Sold Short. Short selling used in the management of the Fund may accelerate the
velocity of potential losses if the prices of securities sold short appreciate
quickly. Stocks purchased may decline in value at the same time stocks sold
short may appreciate in value, thereby increasing potential losses. At December
31, 2006, there were no securities sold short.

  I. Security Lending:

   The Fund may loan securities to qualified brokers through an agreement with
State Street Bank and Trust (the "Custodian"). Under the terms of the
agreement, the Fund receives collateral with a market value not less than 100%
of the market value of loaned securities. Collateral is adjusted daily in
connection with changes in the market value of securities on loan. Collateral
may consist of cash, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or
its agencies and the sovereign debt of foreign countries. Cash collateral has
been invested in a short-term money market fund. Dividends earned on the
collateral and premiums paid by the borrower are recorded as income by the Fund
net of fees and rebates charged by the Custodian for its services in connection
with this securities lending program. Lending portfolio securities involves a
risk of delay in the recovery of the loaned securities or in the foreclosure on
collateral.


NOTE 3 -- PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES:

NOTE 4 -- INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   a) Investment Advisory Fee: The Investment Advisory Agreement (the
"Agreement") between Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC (the "Adviser"), the Fund's
investment adviser, and the Fund provides that, subject to the direction of the
Board of Directors of the Fund and the applicable provisions of the Act, the
adviser is responsible for the actual management of the Fund's portfolio. The
Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd.
("PXP"). PXP is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Phoenix Companies,
Inc. ("PNX"). The responsibility for making decisions to buy, sell or hold a
particular investment rests with the Adviser, subject to review by the Board of
Directors and the applicable provisions of the Act. For the services provided
by the Adviser under the Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee
equal, on an annual basis, to 0.70% of the Fund's average daily net assets.
During the period ended December 31, 2006, the Fund incurred advisory fees of
$3,336,985.

   Zweig Consulting LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), which serves as the Sub-Adviser
for the Fund, performs certain asset allocation research and analysis and
provides such advice to the Adviser. The Sub-Adviser's fees are paid by the
Adviser.

   b) Administration Fee: Phoenix Equity Planning Corporation ("PEPCO"), an
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PNX, serves as the Fund's Administrator
(the "Administrator") pursuant to an Administration Agreement. Effective March
1, 2006, the Administrator receives a fee for financial reporting, tax
services, and oversight of the subagent's performance at a rate of 0.065% of
the Fund's average daily net assets. For the period January 1, 2006 through
February 28, 2006, the rate was 0.13% of the Fund's average daily net assets.
During the period ended December 31, 2006, the Fund incurred Administration
fees of $361,210.

   c) Directors Fee: The Fund pays each Director who is not an interested
person of the Fund or the Adviser a fee of $10,000 per year plus $1,500 per
Directors' or committee meeting attended, together with the out-of-pocket costs
relating to attendance at such meetings. Any Director of the Fund who is an
interested person of the Fund or the Adviser receives no remuneration from the
Fund.

NOTE 5 -- INDEMNIFICATIONS

   Under the Fund's organizational documents, its directors and officers are
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. In addition, the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

NOTE 6 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   At December 31, 2006, the Fund had one class of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of which 500,000,000 shares are authorized and 93,312,556
shares are outstanding.

   Registered shareholders may elect to have all distributions paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder by Computershare as dividend paying agent.
Pursuant to the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders not making such election will have all such amounts

                                      21

<PAGE>


automatically reinvested by Computershare, as the Plan agent, in whole or
fractional shares of the Fund, as the case may be. During the year ended
December 31, 2006 and the year ended December 31, 2005, 421,068 and 0 shares,
respectively, were issued pursuant to the Plan.

   On December 19, 2006, the Fund announced a distribution of $0.043 per share
to shareholders of record on December 29, 2006. This distribution has an
ex-dividend date of January 3, 2007, and is payable on January 8, 2007.

NOTE 7 -- CREDIT RISK AND ASSET CONCENTRATIONS

   In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may present
greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments
may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in
these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these
investments and the income they generate, as well as the Fund's ability to
repatriate such amounts.

   The Fund may invest a high percentage of its assets in specific sectors of
the market in its pursuit of a greater investment return. Fluctuations in these
sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on the Fund, positive or
negative, than if the Fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

   To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Zweig Total Return Fund,
Inc.

   In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the schedule of investments and securities sold short, and the
related statements of operations and of changes in net assets and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") at December 31, 2006, the
results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2006 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provides a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

Item 2. Code of Ethics.

  (a)    The registrant, as of the end of the period covered by this report,
         has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's
         principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
         accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
         functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the
         registrant or a third party.

  (c)    There have been no amendments, during the period covered by this
         report, to a provision of the code of ethics that applies to the
         registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
         principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing
         similar functions, regardless of whether these individuals are
         employed by the registrant or a third party, and that relates to any
         element of the code of ethics described in Item 2(b) of the
         instructions for completion of Form N-CSR.

  (d)    The registrant has not granted any waivers, during the period covered
         by this report, including an implicit waiver, from a provision of the
         code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal executive
         officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
         controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of
         whether these individuals are employed by the registrant or a third
         party, that relates to one or more of the items set forth in paragraph
         (b) of the instructions for completion of this Item.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The registrant does not have an audit committee financial expert at this time
because none of the registrant's board of directors meets the technical
definition of such an expert in form N-CSR. The audit committee of the board is
in compliance with applicable rules of the listing requirements for closed-end
fund audit committees, including the requirement that all members of the audit
committee be "financially literate" and that at least one member of the audit
committee have "accounting or related financial management expertise", as
determined by the board.

Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.

Audit Fees

  (a)    The aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years for
         professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the
         audit of the registrant's annual financial statements or services that
         are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory
         and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years are
         $32,000 for 2006 and $32,000 for 2005.

<PAGE>

Audit-Related Fees

  (b)    The aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for
         assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are
         reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the registrant's
         financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (a) of this
         Item are $1,000 for 2006 and $1,000 for 2005. This represents the
         review of the semi-annual financial statements.

Tax Fees

  (c)    The aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for
         professional services rendered by the principal accountant for tax
         compliance, tax advice, and tax planning are $5,025 for 2006 and
         $6,350 for 2005.

         "Tax Fees" are those primarily associated with review of the Trust's
         tax provision and qualification as a regulated investment company
         (RIC) in connection with audits of the Trust's financial statement,
         review of year-end distributions by the Fund to avoid excise tax for
         the Trust, periodic discussion with management on tax issues affecting
         the Trust, and reviewing and signing the Fund's federal income and
         excise tax returns.

All Other Fees

  (d)    The aggregate fees billed in each of the last two fiscal years for
         products and services provided by the principal accountant, other than
         the services reported in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item are
         $0 for 2006 and $0 for 2005.

  (e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
         described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

         The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") Board has adopted
         policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of services
         provided by PwC. The Audit Committee pre-approves: (i) all audit and
         non-audit services to be rendered to the Fund by PwC; and (ii) all
         non-audit services to be rendered to the Fund, financial reporting of
         the Fund provided by PwC to the Adviser or any affiliate thereof that
         provides ongoing services to the Fund (collectively, "Covered
         Services"). The Audit Committee has adopted pre-approval procedures
         authorizing a member of the Audit Committee to pre-approve from time
         to time, on behalf of the Audit Committee, all Covered Services to be
         provided by PwC which are not otherwise pre-approved at a meeting of
         the Audit committee, provided that such delegate reports to the full
         Audit Committee at its next meeting. The pre-approval procedures do
         not include delegation of the Audit committee's responsibilities to
         management. Pre-approval has not been waived with respect to any of
         the services described above since the date on which the Audit
         Committee adopted its current pre-approval procedures.

  (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
         (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to
         paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

             (b) 100% for 2006; 100% for 2005

             (c) 100% for 2006; 100% for 2005

             (d) Not applicable for 2006; Not applicable for 2005

<PAGE>

  (f)    The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
         engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons
         other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees
         was less than fifty percent.

  (g)    The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
         services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
         investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen
         by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled
         by, or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing
         services to the registrant for each of the last two fiscal years of
         the registrant was $961,830 for 2006 and $892,561 for 2005.

  (h)    The registrant's audit committee of the board of directors has
         considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
         rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
         sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
         entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
         investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
         that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
         accountant's independence.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed registrants.

The registrant has a separately designated audit committee consisting of all
the independent directors of the registrant. Audit Committee Members are:
Charles H. Brunie, Wendy Luscombe, Prof. Alden C. Olson, James B. Rogers and R.
Keith Walton.

                              THE ZWEIG FUND, INC

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC

               STATEMENT OF POLICY WITH RESPECT TO PROXY VOTING

I   Definitions. As used in this Statement of Policy, the following terms shall
    have the meanings ascribed below:

<PAGE>

     A.  "Adviser" refers to Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC.

     B.  "Corporate Governance Matters" refers to changes involving the
         corporate ownership or structure of an issuer whose securities are
         within a Portfolio Holding, including changes in the state of
         incorporation, changes in capital structure, including increases and
         decreases of capital and preferred stock issuance, mergers and other

     C.  "Delegate" refers to the Adviser or Subadviser to whom responsibility
         has been delegated to vote proxies for the applicable Portfolio
         Holding, including any qualified, independent organization engaged by
         the Adviser to vote proxies on behalf of such delegated entity.

     D.  "Fund" shall individually and collectively mean and refer to The Zweig
         Fund, Inc. and The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc., and each of them.

     E.  "Management Matters" refers to stock option plans and other management
         compensation issues.

     I.  "Takeover" refers to "hostile" or "friendly" efforts to effect radical

II. General Policy. It is the intention of the Fund to exercise stock ownership
    rights in Portfolio Holdings in a manner that is reasonably anticipated to
    further the best economic interests of shareholders of the Fund.
    Accordingly, the Fund or its Delegate(s) shall endeavor to analyze and vote
    all proxies that are considered likely to have financial implications, and,
    where appropriate, to participate in corporate governance, shareholder
    proposals, management communications and legal proceedings. The Fund and
    its Delegate(s) must also identify potential or actual conflicts of
    interests in voting proxies and address any such conflict of interest in
    accordance with this Statement of Policy.

III Factors to consider when voting.

     A.  A Delegate may abstain from voting when it concludes that the effect
         on shareholders' economic interests or the value of the Portfolio
         Holding is indeterminable or insignificant.

     B   In analyzing anti-takeover measures, the Delegate shall vote on a
         case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as overall
         long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
         industry competition. Key measures which shall be considered include,
         without limitation, five-year annual compound growth rates for sales,
         operating income, net income, and total shareholder returns (share
         price appreciation plus dividends). Other financial indicators that
         will be considered include margin analysis, cash flow, and debit
         levels.

     C.  In analyzing contested elections, the Delegate shall vote on a
         case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as the
         qualifications of all director nominees. The Delegate shall also
         consider the independence and attendance record of board and key
         committee members. A review of the corporate governance profile shall
         be completed highlighting entrenchment devices that may reduce
         accountability.

<PAGE>

     D.  In analyzing corporate governance matters, the Delegate shall vote on
         a case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as tax and
         economic benefits associated with amending an issuer's state of
         incorporation, dilution or improved accountability associated with
         changes in capital structure, management proposals to require a
         supermajority shareholder vote to amend charters and bylaws and
         bundled or "conditioned" proxy proposals.

     E.  In analyzing executive compensation proposals and management matters,
         the Adviser shall vote on a case-by-case basis taking into
         consideration such factors as executive pay and spending on
         perquisites, particularly in conjunction with sub-par performance and
         employee layoffs.

     F.  In analyzing proxy contests for control, the Delegate shall vote on a
         case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as long-term
         financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
         management's track record; background to the proxy contest;
         qualifications of director nominees (both slates); evaluation of what
         each side is offering shareholders as well as the likelihood that the
         proposed objectives and goals can be met; and stock ownership
         positions.

     G.  A Delegate shall generally vote against shareholder social matters
         proposals.

IV  Delegation.

     A.  In the absence of a specific direction to the contrary from the Board
         of Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser will be responsible for voting
         proxies for all Portfolio Holdings in accordance with this Statement
         of Policy, or for delegating such responsibility as described below.

     B.  The Adviser delegated with authority to vote proxies for Portfolio
         Holdings shall be deemed to assume a duty of care to safeguard the
         best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. No Delegate shall
         accept direction or inappropriate influence from any other client,
         director or employee of any affiliated company and shall not cast any
         vote inconsistent with this Statement of Policy without obtaining the
         prior approval of the Fund or its duly authorized representative(s).

     C.  With regard to each Series for which there is a duly appointed
         Subadviser acting pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
         satisfying the requirements of Section 15(a) of the Investment Company
         Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder, the Subadviser may,
         pursuant to delegated authority from the Adviser, vote proxies for
         Portfolio Holdings with regard to the Series or portion of the assets
         thereof for which the Subadviser is responsible. In such case, the
         Subadviser shall vote proxies for the Portfolio Holdings in accordance
         with Sections II, III and V of this Statement of Policy, provided,
         however, that the Subadviser may vote proxies in accordance with its
         own proxy voting policy/procedures ("Subadviser Procedures") if the
         following two conditions are satisfied: (1) the Adviser must have
         approved the Subadviser Procedures based upon the Adviser's
         determination that the Subadviser Procedures are reasonably designed
         to further the best economic interests of the affected Fund
         shareholders, and (2) the Subadviser Procedures are reviewed and
         approved annually by the Board of Trustees. The Subadviser will
         promptly notify the Adviser of any material changes to the Subadviser
         Procedures. The Adviser will periodically review the votes by the
         Subadviser for consistency with this Statement of Policy.

V.  Conflicts of Interest

     A.  The Fund and its Delegate(s) seek to avoid actual or perceived
         conflicts of interest in the voting of proxies for Portfolio Holdings
         between the interests of Fund shareholders, on one hand, and those of
         the Adviser, Delegate, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
         of the Fund, on the other hand. The Board of Trustees may take into
         account a wide array of factors in determining whether such a conflict
         exists, whether such conflict is material in nature, and how to
         properly address or resolve the same.

     B.  While each conflict situation varies based on the particular facts
         presented and the requirements of governing law, the Board of Trustees
         or its delegate(s) may take the following actions, among others, or
         otherwise give weight to the following factors, in addressing material
         conflicts of interest in voting (or directing Delegates to vote)
         proxies pertaining to Portfolio Holdings: (i) rely on the
         recommendations of an established, independent third party with
         qualifications to vote proxies such as Institutional Shareholder
         Services; (ii) vote pursuant to the recommendation of the proposing
         Delegate; (iii) abstaining; or (iv) where two or more Delegates
         provide conflicting requests, vote shares in proportion to the assets
         under management of the each proposing Delegate.

     C.  The Adviser shall promptly notify the President of the Fund once any
         actual or potential conflict of interest exists and their
         recommendations for protecting the best interests of Fund's
         shareholders. No Adviser shall waive any conflict of interest or vote
         any conflicted proxies without the prior written approval of the Board
         of Trustees or the President of the Fund pursuant to section D of this
         Article.

     D.  In the event that a determination, authorization or waiver under this
         Statement of Policy is requested at a time other than a regularly
         scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees, the President of the Fund
         shall be empowered with the power and responsibility to interpret and
         apply this Statement of Policy and provide a report of his or her
         determinations at the next following meeting of the Board of Trustees.

VI. Miscellaneous.

     A.  A copy of the current Statement of Policy with Respect to Proxy Voting
         and the voting records for the Fund reconciling proxies with Portfolio
         Holdings and recording proxy voting guideline compliance and
         justification, shall be kept in an easily accessible place and
         available upon request.

     B.  The Adviser shall present a report of any material deviations from
         this Statement of Policy at every regularly scheduled meeting of the
         Board of Trustees and shall provide such other reports as the Board of
         Trustees may request from time to time. The Adviser shall provide to
         the Fund or any shareholder a record of its effectuation of proxy
         voting pursuant to this Statement of Policy at such times and in such
         format or medium as the Fund shall reasonably request. The Adviser
         shall be solely responsible for complying with the disclosure and
         reporting requirements under applicable laws and regulations,
         including, without limitation, Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
         Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser shall gather, collate and present
         information relating to the its proxy voting activities of those of
         each Delegate in such format and medium as the Fund shall determine
         from time to time in order for the Fund to discharge its disclosure
         and reporting obligations pursuant to Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment
         Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     C.  The Adviser shall pay all costs associated with proxy voting for
         Portfolio Holdings pursuant to this Statement of Policy and assisting
         the Fund in providing public notice of the manner in which such
         proxies were voted.

     D.  The Adviser may delegate its responsibilities hereunder to a proxy
         committee established from time to time by the Adviser, as the case
         may be. In performing its duties hereunder, the Adviser, or any

<PAGE>

         duly authorized committee, may engage the services of a research
         and/or voting adviser or agent, the cost of which shall be borne by
         such entity.

   This Statement of Policy shall be presented to the Board of Trustees
   annually for their amendment and/or approval.

       Potential Conflicts of Interests

       There may be certain inherent conflicts of interest that arise in
       connection with the Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's management of each
       Fund's investments and the investments of any other accounts he manages.
       Such conflicts could arise from the aggregation of orders for all
       accounts managed by a particular portfolio manager, the allocation of
       purchases across all such accounts, the allocation of IPOs and any soft
       dollar arrangements that the Adviser may have in place that could
       benefit the Funds and/or such other accounts. The Board of
       Trustees/Directors has adopted on behalf of the Funds policies and
       procedures designed to address any such conflicts of interest to ensure
       that all transactions are executed in the best interest of the Funds'
       shareholders. The Advisers and Subadviser are required to certify their
       compliance with these procedures to the Board of Trustees on a quarterly
       basis. There have been no material compliance issues with respect to any
       of these policies and procedures during the Funds' most recent fiscal
       year ended December 31, 2006. Additionally, there are no material
       conflicts of interest between the investment strategy of a Fund and the
       investment strategy of other accounts managed by Mr. Neel and
       Mr. Dickerson since portfolio managers generally manage funds and other
       accounts having similar investment strategies.

(a)(3) Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management Team Members

       For the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2006,
       following is a description of Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's
       compensation structure as portfolio managers of PZA and Euclid.

       Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd. and its affiliated investment
       management firms (collectively, "PXP"), believe that the firm's
       compensation program is adequate and competitive to attract and retain
       high-caliber investment professionals. Investment professionals at PXP
       receive a competitive base salary, an incentive bonus opportunity and a
       benefits package. Managing Directors and portfolio investment
       professionals who supervise and manage others also participate in a
       management incentive program reflecting their personal contribution and
       team performance. Highly compensated individuals can also take advantage
       of a long-term Incentive Compensation program to defer their
       compensation and reduce tax implications.

<PAGE>

       The bonus package for portfolio managers is based upon how well the
       individual manager meets or exceeds assigned goals and subjective
       assessment of contribution to the team effort. Their incentive bonus
       also reflects a performance component for achieving and/or exceeding
       performance competitive with peers managing similar strategies. Such
       component is further adjusted to reward investment personnel for
       managing within the stated framework and for not taking unnecessary
       risks. This ensures that investment personnel will remain focused on
       managing and acquiring securities that correspond to a fund's mandate
       and risk profile. It also avoids the temptation for portfolio managers
       to take on more risk and unnecessary exposure to chase performance for
       personal gain.

       Finally, Portfolio Managers and investment professionals may also
       receive The Phoenix Companies, Inc. ("PNX") stock options and/or be
       granted PNX restricted stock at the direction of the parent's Board of
       Directors.

       Following is a more detailed description of the compensation structure
       of the Fund's portfolio managers.

       Base Salary. Each Portfolio Manager is paid a fixed base salary, which
       is determined by PXP and is designed to be competitive in light of the
       individual's experience and responsibilities. PXP management uses
       compensation survey results of investment industry compensation
       conducted by an independent third party in evaluating competitive market
       compensation for its investment management professionals.

       Incentive Bonus. Generally, the current Performance Incentive Plan for
       portfolio managers at PXP is made up of three components:

           (1)Seventy percent of the target incentive is based on achieving
              investment area investment goals and individual performance. The
              Investment Incentive pool will be established based on actual
              pre-tax investment performance compared with specific peer group
              or index measures established at the beginning of each calendar
              year. Performance of the funds managed is measured over one,
              three and five-year periods against specified benchmarks and/or
              peer groups for each fund managed. Performance of the PNX general
              account and growth of revenue, if applicable to a particular
              portfolio manager, is measured on a one-year basis. Generally,
              individual manager's participation is based on the performance of
              each fund/account managed as weighted roughly by total assets in
              each of those funds/accounts.

           (2)Fifteen percent of the target incentive is based on the
              profitability of the investment management division with which
              the portfolio manager is associated. This component of the plan
              is paid in restricted stock units of The Phoenix Companies, Inc.,
              which vest over three years.

           (3)Fifteen percent of the target incentive is based on the portfolio
              manager's investment area's competencies and on individual
              performance. This pool is funded based on The Phoenix Companies,
              Inc.'s return on equity.

       The Performance Incentive Plan applicable to some portfolio managers may
       vary from the description above. For instance, plans applicable to
       certain portfolio managers (i) may specify different percentages of
       target incentive that is based on investment goals and individual
       performance and on The Phoenix Companies, Inc. return on equity,
       (ii) may not contain the component that is based on the profitability of
       the management division with which the portfolio manager is associated,
       or (iii) may contain a guarantee payout percentage of certain portions
       of the Performance Incentive Plan.

       Long-Term Incentive Bonus. Certain portfolio managers are eligible for a
       long-term incentive plan that is paid in restricted stock units of The
       Phoenix Companies, Inc. which vest over three years. Awards under this
       plan are contingent upon PNX achieving its cash return on equity
       objective, generally over a three-year period. Target award
       opportunities for eligible participants are determined by PNX's
       Compensation Committee.

<PAGE>

       Other Benefits. Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in
       broad-based plans offered generally to the firm's employees, including
       broad-based retirement, 401(k), health and other employee benefit plans.

(a)(4) Disclosure of Securities Ownership

                 CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

   The Phoenix mutual funds/1/ (each, and collectively, a "Fund") is committed
to conducting business in accordance with applicable laws, rules and
regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to full and
accurate disclosure -- financial and otherwise -- in compliance with applicable
law. This Code of Ethics, applicable to each Fund's Chief Executive Officer,
President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
functions) (together, "Senior Officers"), sets forth policies to guide you in

thereof (collectively, "Phoenix") and as officers or trustees/directors of
other registered investment companies and unregistered investment funds advised
by Phoenix. This Code of Ethics also recognizes that certain laws and
regulations applicable to, and certain policies and procedures adopted by, the
Fund, the Adviser or Phoenix govern your conduct in connection with many of the
conflict of interest situations that arise in connection with the operations of

..   the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and
    regulation promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange Commission
    (the "1940 Act");

..   the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules and
    regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (the "Advisers Act");

..   the Code of Ethics adopted by the Fund pursuant to Rule 17j-1(c) under the
    1940 Act (collectively, the "Fund's 1940 Act Code of Ethics");

..   one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Adviser that have been reviewed
    and approved by those trustees (the "Trustees") of the Fund that are not
    "interested persons" of the Fund (the "Independent Trustees") within the
    meaning of the 1940 Act (the "Adviser's 1940 Act Code of Ethics" and,
    together with the Fund's 1940 Act Code of Ethics, the "1940 Act Codes of
    Ethics");

..   the policies and procedures adopted by the Fund to address conflict of
    interest situations, such as procedures under Rule 10f-3 and Rule 17a-7
    under the 1940 Act (collectively, the "Fund Policies"); and

..   each Adviser's general policies and procedures to address, among other
    things, conflict of interest situations and related matters (collectively,
    the "Adviser Policies").

The provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the Fund Policies and the Adviser Policies are referred to herein collectively
as the "Additional Conflict Rules".

   This Code of Ethics is different from, and is intended to supplement, the
Additional Conflict Rules. Accordingly, a violation of the Additional Conflict
Rules by a Senior Officer is hereby deemed not to be a violation of this Code
of Ethics, unless and until the Board of Trustees of the Fund (the "Board")
shall determine that any such violation of the Additional Conflict Rules is
also a violation of this Code of Ethics.

Senior Officers Should Act Honestly and Candidly

   Each Senior Officer has a responsibility to the Fund to act with integrity.
Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid. Deceit and
subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

<PAGE>

   Each Senior Officer must:

..   act with integrity, including being honest and candid while still
    maintaining the confidentiality of information where required by law or the
    Additional Conflict Rules;

..   not withhold any relevant information;

..   comply with the laws, rules and regulations that govern the conduct of the
    Fund's operations and report any suspected violations thereof in accordance
    with the section below entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

..   adhere to a high standard of business ethics.

Conflicts Of Interest

   A conflict of interest for the purpose of this Code of Ethics occurs when
your private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere, with
the interests of the Fund. Senior Officers are expected to use objective and
unbiased standards when making decisions that affect the Fund, keeping in mind
that Senior Officers are subject to certain inherent conflicts of interest
because Senior Officers of a Fund also are or may be officers of the Adviser
and other funds advised or serviced by Phoenix (as a result of which it is
incumbent upon you to be familiar with and to seek to comply with the
Additional Conflict Rules).

   You are required to conduct the business of the Fund in an honest and
ethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts
of interest between personal and business relationships. When making any
investment, accepting any position or benefits, participating in any
transaction or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that
creates or appears to create a conflict of interest with respect to the Fund
where you are receiving a personal benefit, you should act in accordance with
the letter and spirit of this Code of Ethics.

   If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of this Code of
Ethics to you as a Senior Officer of the Fund, you should make full disclosure
of all relevant facts and circumstances to the Chief Compliance Officer of the
Fund (the "Chief Compliance Officer") and obtain the prior approval of the
Chief Compliance Officer prior to taking or not taking action.

   Some conflict of interest situations that should always be approved by the
Chief Compliance Officer, if material, include the following:

..   the receipt of any entertainment or non-nominal gift by the Senior Officer,
    or a member of his or her family, from any company with which the Fund has
    current or prospective business dealings (other than the Adviser or
    Phoenix), unless such entertainment or gift is business related,

<PAGE>

  reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
   to raise any question of impropriety;

..   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
    with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than the Adviser or
    Phoenix; or

..   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges
    or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio transactions or for
    selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the Senior
    Officer's employment by the Adviser or Phoenix, such as compensation or
    equity ownership.

   Nominal gifts in the aggregate may rise to create a conflict of interest. In
the event that you are involved in any of these situations, you should
immediately disclose the situation to the Chief Compliance Officer and to
Counsel for the independent trustees. The Chief Compliance Officer will
disclose the situation to the full Board.

Disclosures

   It is the policy of the Fund to make full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations in all reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits
to, the Securities and Exchange Commission or a national securities exchange
and in all other public communications made by the Fund. As a Senior Officer,
you are required to promote compliance with this policy and to abide by the
Fund's standards, policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with
this policy.

   Each Senior Officer must:

..   familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements applicable
    to the Fund as well as the business and financial operations of the Fund;
    and

..   not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts about
    the Fund to others, including to the Trustees, the Fund's independent
    auditors, the Fund's counsel, counsel to the Independent Directors,
    governmental regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

..   not knowingly withhold, or cause others to withhold, facts about the Fund
    to others, including to other Trustees, the Fund's independent auditors,
    the Fund's counsel, counsel to the independent Trustees, governmental
    regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance With Code Of Ethics

   If you know of or suspect a violation of this Code of Ethics or other laws,
regulations, policies or procedures applicable to the Fund, you must report that

<PAGE>

information on a timely basis to the Chief Compliance Officer or report it
anonymously by following the "whistle blower" policies adopted by the Fund from
time to time. For the purposes hereof, the Fund has endorsed usage of the
Phoenix confidential, 24-hour toll-free telephone help line at 1-800-813-8180
and shall require the Phoenix Chief Compliance Officer to promptly report any
calls made to such number affecting a Fund. No one will be subject to
retaliation because of a good faith report of a suspected violation.

   The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

..   the Chief Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to
    investigate any actual or potential violations reported to him or her;

..   violations and potential violations will be reported to the applicable Fund
    Board after such investigation;

..   if the Fund Board determines that a violation has occurred, it will take
    all appropriate disciplinary or preventive action; and

..   appropriate disciplinary or preventive action may include a letter of
    censure, suspension, dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other
    serious violations of law, notification of the Securities and Exchange
    Commission or other appropriate law enforcement authorities.

   Senior Officers must make this Code of Ethics known to persons who might
know of a potential conflict of interest, including the "whistle blower"
policies adopted by the Fund from time to time.

Waivers Of Code Of Ethics

   Except as otherwise provided in this Code of Ethics, the Chief Compliance
Officer is responsible for applying this Code of Ethics to specific situations
in which questions are presented to the Chief Compliance Officer and has the
authority to interpret this Code of Ethics in any particular situation. The
Chief Compliance Officer shall take all action he or she considers appropriate
to investigate any actual or potential violations reported under this Code of
Ethics.

   The Chief Compliance Officer is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with
the chair of the Fund Board and with counsel to the Fund, the Adviser, Phoenix
or the Independent Trustees, and is encouraged to do so.

   Each Fund Board, or any duly designated committee thereof, is responsible
for granting waivers of this Code of Ethics, as appropriate. Any changes to or
waivers of this Code of Ethics will, to the extent required, be disclosed on
Form N-CSR, or otherwise, as provided by Securities and Exchange Commission
rules.

<PAGE>

Recordkeeping

   The Fund will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six
(6) years from the date an action is taken, the first two (2) years in an
easily accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the
Fund Board or to any appropriate Committee thereof:

..   that provided the basis for any amendment or waiver to this Code of Ethics;
    and

..   relating to any violation of this Code of Ethics and sanctions imposed for
    such violation, together with a written record of the approval or action
    taken by the Board.

Confidentiality

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code of
Ethics shall be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code of Ethics, such
matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Trustees
and their counsel, the Fund and its counsel, the Adviser and/or other Phoenix
entity and its counsel and any other advisors, consultants or counsel retained
by the Trustees, the Independent Trustees or any committee of the Board.

Amendments

   This Code of Ethics may not be amended except in written form, which is
specifically approved by a majority vote of the Trustees of each Fund,
including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

No Rights Created

   This Code of Ethics is a statement of certain fundamental principles,
policies and procedures that govern each of the Senior Officers in the conduct
of each Fund's business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights
in any employee, investor, supplier, competitor, shareholder or any other
person or entity.
