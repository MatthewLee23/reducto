Dear Shareowner,
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Staying diversified and keeping your portfolio invested in the markets are two
general investment principles that have served investors well over time. They
are particularly useful guides to keep in mind today, at a time when markets
around the globe are being buffeted by problems in the financial and real
estate industries and by concerns about a slowing economy.

After an extended period of steady economic growth with sustained low
unemployment and low inflation, the U.S. economy ran into difficulty as 2007
drew to a close. Investors in subprime mortgages were forced to mark down the
value of their assets, imperiling leveraged balance sheets. The ensuing credit
crunch forced central banks in the United States and Europe to assume the role
of "lender of last resort" to keep credit markets functioning. Conditions
worsened in the first quarter of 2008, as falling prices, margin calls and
deleveraging continued, and while the auction rate preferred market seized up.
The U.S. Federal Reserve expanded its lender-of-last- resort role to include
lending to primary dealers and continued to cut interest rates. By then,
recession talk was widespread as concern grew that falling home prices, rising
unemployment, sharply rising food and energy prices, and disruptions in
financial markets posed a significant threat to economic growth.

Markets reacted poorly to the developments leading up to the near failure of
Bear Stearns, with fixed-income credit spreads (the difference in rates between
corporate and U.S. government bonds) widening dramatically and stock markets
declining, wiping out the positive returns markets had delivered in the
preceding calendar year. Treasury bond prices rose as the market underwent a
flight to quality. In the eleven weeks between the Bear Stearns event and the
end of May 2008, though, there were no further market crises, recession fears
faded in light of positive economic news, and stock markets rallied, recouping
some of their first-quarter losses, while Treasury bond prices fell back.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Standard & Poor's 500 Index each fell 4%,
and the NASDAQ Composite Index fell 5% over the six-month period ending May 31,
2008. The MSCI EAFE Developed Market Index of international stock markets fell
5% during the same period, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 2%. The
U.S. investment-grade bond market, as measured by the Lehman Brothers Aggregate
Bond Index, rose 1% over the six-month period ending

<PAGE>

Letter

May 31, 2008 while the U.S. high-yield bond market, as measured by the Merrill
Lynch High Yield Bond Master II Index, rose 2% during the same period.

A weak U.S. dollar and substantial fiscal and monetary stimulus are potent
support for the economy. Markets remain volatile, and falling risk tolerances
and deleveraging may depress asset prices in the short term, but equity and
corporate bond valuations look attractive over a longer time horizon unless the
U.S. economy falls into a severe and protracted recession.

Sudden swings in the markets are always to be expected, but they are difficult
to time. Maintaining a long-term time horizon, being diversified, and paying
attention to asset allocation are important investment principles. As always,
we encourage you to work closely with your financial advisor to find the mix of
stocks, bonds and money market assets that is best aligned to your particular
risk tolerance and investment objective and to adhere to a strategic plan
rather than letting emotions drive investment decisions.

Respectfully,

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value "NAV", due to such factors as
interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are
sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices
lower than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total
liabilities, which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of common
shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher than market
price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.

Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CSFB Leveraged Loan Index is a
representative index of tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated
loans. The index began in January 1992. Index returns are calculated monthly,
assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any
fees, expenses or sales charges. You cannot invest directly in an index.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION 5/31/08
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the following report, portfolio managers Mark Okada and Joseph Dougherty of
Highland Capital Management, the subadviser of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust,
discuss the Trust's performance and investment process over the six months
ended May 31, 2008. Mark Bradley, Treasurer of the Trust, discusses the issues
regarding auction-rate securities and the Trust's dividend.

Q:  How did the Trust perform for the six-month period ended May 31, 2008?

A:  For the six-month period May 31, 2008, Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned
    -5.05% at net asset value, including reinvestment of dividends. The market
    price return over that same period was -5.02%, and the Trust was selling
    at a discount of market price to net asset value of 7.1% on May 31, 2008.
    The Trust's benchmark, the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index, returned
    -1.61% for the six-month period ended May 31, 2008. The index has an
    average rating of BB versus the Trust's average rating, which is closer to
    B (See Portfolio Quality composition on page 4). Problems in the credit
    markets, stemming from the subprime mortgage debacle, led to one of the
    most volatile periods in many years for the credit market. During this
    period investors gravitated toward the highest quality investments. As a
    result, higher-quality securities outperformed the market. Unlike
    open-ended funds, a closed-end fund's price goes up and down based on
    market supply and demand, independent of a fund's net asset value per
    share. During the six months ending May 31, 2008, the Federal funds target
    rate (the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans) declined to

    Index returns assume reinvestment of all dividends and distributions, if
    any. Indices are unmanaged, have no fees or costs and are not available for
    investment. The performance of the indices may be materially different
    from the individual performance attained by a specific investor. In
    addition, the investors' holdings may differ significantly from the
    securities that comprise the indices. The indices have not been selected
    to represent an appropriate benchmark to compare an investor's performance,
    but rather are disclosed to allow for comparison of the investor's
    performance to that of certain well-known and widely recognized indices.

    The Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index is designed to mirror the investable
    universe of the $U.S.-denominated leveraged loan market. The index
    inception is January 1992. The index frequency is monthly. New loans are
    added to the index on their issuance date if they qualify according to the
    following criteria: Loans must be rated "5B" or lower; only funded term
    loans are included; the original maturity must be at least one year; and
    the Issuers must be domiciled in developed countries (Issuers from
    developing countries are excluded). Fallen angels are added to the index
    subject to the new loan criteria. (Source: Credit Suisse, Description and
    Inclusion Rules of the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index, January 18,
    2006).

Q:  What was the investment environment like for floating-rate loans during the
    six-month period ending May 31, 2008?

A:  The crisis in the broader credit market led to significant volatility in
    corporate bank loans for the six months ended May 31, 2008. The Credit
    Suisse Leveraged Loan Index returned -1.61% during the period - a time
    that includes January and February 2008, which were the second and third
    worst months on record for the index. During January and February 2008,
    the Index returned -3.10% and -2.39%, respectively. The loan market
    rallied in April 2008, which was the best month on record, with the Index
    returning 3.31%.

Q:  What factors contributed to the volatility in floating-rate loans during the
    six-month period ending May 31, 2008?

A:  We believe the loan market correction remains primarily technical in nature
    and has been driven in part by a loss of demand for collateralized loan
    obligations (CLOs) and overall concern for the health of the financial
    system and the economy. The CLO market, while recently showing some life,
    remains below the pre-credit crash levels. Opportunistic, non-traditional
    loan buyers, such as pension funds and private equity firms, have stepped
    in, but have been unable completely to fill the void left by the CLO
    market. The inventory of loans has worked its way down from $156 million
    at the beginning of 2008 to $87 million at the end of May 2008.
    Approximately 30% of the remaining inventory is composed of two large
    leveraged buyouts (LBOs) - Clear Channel and Bell Canada (BCE). With the
    available loan supply coming down, market participants are looking for
    leveraged buyers to come into the market so that the average bid on loan
    indices will rise.

Q:  What changes did you make to the portfolio during the six-month period
    ending May 31, 2008?

A:  In May 2008, Pioneer announced a cut in the dividend in the Trust from
    $0.145 to $0.115 per share. The decision was made in response to the
    decreasing earning rate of the floating-rate positions in the Trust. The
    earnings rate of the Trust declined largely because of the decrease in
    LIBOR - the base rate used by the floating-rate instruments in determining
    the total coupon of the investments. We rebalanced some of our floating
    rate investments into fixed-rate investments to maintain the high current
    income in the Trust, as a response to the decreasing LIBOR rate and the
    corresponding effect it has had on the coupon earned by the floating-rate
    investments in the Trust. On November 30, 2007, the Trust had 93.4% of its
    portfolio invested in Senior Secured loans. As of the May 31, 2008, the
    Trust had 88.7% of its portfolio invested in Senior Secured loans.


Q:  What is your outlook for floating-rate securities and the Trust?

A:  Recent collateral and interest coverage levels suggest the corporate
    bank loan market is fundamentally solid; and while we expect
    defaults to increase, we do not expect them to approach the


                                                                               9

    relatively high levels priced in by the market during the first quarter
    of 2008.

    The current market correction could be viewed as a positive for the Trust
    by creating potential attractive buying opportunities. Our analysts have
    spotted some potentially good buying opportunities for the remainder of
    2008 as the supply/demand dynamic becomes more attractive and the CLO
    market reopens, or other buyers enter, adding support to the market.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The following two questions are responded to by Mark Bradley,
    Treasurer of the Trust.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:  Have the problems involving auction-rate securities affected the Trust
    during the six-month period ended May 31, 2008?

A:  The auction-rate preferred shares (ARPS) market began failing in
    mid-February 2008. As of May 31, 2008, the Trust's assets included
    approximately $234 million attributable to ARPs, representing
    approximately 37% of the Trust's total assets. As a result of the auction
    failures, the Trust now pays dividends on the ARPs at a "maximum rate."
    The maximum rate paid on the Trust's ARPs since February 2008, has ranged
    between 4.0% and 4.3%. As the maximum rates remain lower than the earnings
    rates produced by the Trust's portfolio of securities, leverage is still
    currently an effective strategy for the Trust. However, Pioneer is very
    concerned about the shareholders who own ARPs and are in need of
    liquidity. Pioneer continues to explore and evaluate potential solutions
    to the ARPs issue, including obtaining alternative forms of leverage.
    Consistent with its duty to common shareholders, the Board of Trustees
    continues to meet with management to discuss the specific circumstances of
    each Pioneer closed-end fund that has issued ARPs. At this time, there can
    be no assurance that Pioneer will be successful in obtaining alternative
    forms of leverage or that such leverage will be more effective than the
    ARPs.

Q:  Why was the Trust's dividend cut in May 2008?

A:  We set the dividend rate at a level close to the earnings rate for the
    Trust. The Trust does not use any return-of-capital to supplement the
    distribution. U.S. interest rates, as measured by three-month LIBOR,
    have generally followed the path of Federal funds

    rate over the past six months ended May 31, 2008, which declined 2.00% at
    the end of May 2008, from 5.25% in September 2007, when the Federal
    Reserve began cutting the Federal funds target rate. The Trust's income is
    derived from the floating-rate loans held in the portfolio. Over the past
    few months, these loans have reset, and the Trust is taking in less income
    than it had been. The dividend cut translates into a yield of 8.8%, based
    on net asset value, and a market yield of about 9.4%, as of the May 31,
    2008 close.

    Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is contained
    in the Trust's original offering prospectus. Please refer to this document
    when considering the Trust's risks.

    Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
    greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
    that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

    When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the
    Trust will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall the prices
    of fixed-income securities in the Trust will generally rise. The
    floating-rate feature of the Trust means that the Trust will not
    experience capital appreciation in a declining interest-rate environment.
    Investments in the Trust are subject to possible loss due to the financial
    failure of issuers of underlying securities and their inability to meet
    their debt obligations.

    The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
    and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

    The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
    invested in floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be
    illiquid. Illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair
    price at the times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and
    their market price is generally more volatile than that of more liquid
    securities. Illiquid securities are also more difficult to value, and
    investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the
    Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.


                                                                              11

    The Trust currently uses leverage through the issuance of preferred
    shares. The Trust also is authorized to borrow from banks and to issue
    debt securities, which are other forms of leverage. Leverage creates
    significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital
    appreciation will not be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which
    may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares.

    The Trust is not diversified, which means that it can invest a higher
    percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund. Being
    non-diversified may magnify the Trust's losses from adverse events
    affecting a particular issuer.

    Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic
    trends or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future
    performance are statements of the opinion of the Trust's sub-adviser as of
    the date of this report. These statements should not be relied upon for
    any other purposes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results,
    and there is no guarantee that market forecasts discussed will be
    realized.

FAS 157 Footnote Disclosures

Various inputs are used in determining the value of the Trust's investments.
These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

Highest priority is given to Level 1 inputs and lowest priority is given to
Level 3.

Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
          similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
          etc.)

Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
          assumptions in determining fair value of investments)

The following is a summary of the inputs used as of May 31, 2008, in valuing
the Trust's assets:

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/08 (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") is organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The investment objective
of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a
secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent
with its primary goal of high current income.

The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a
developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency
exchange restrictions.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans"). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, and high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The
Trust may invest in Senior Loans and other securities of any credit quality,
including Senior Loans and other investments that are rated below investment
grade, or are unrated but are determined by the investment sub-adviser to be of
equivalent credit quality. Below investment grade securities are commonly
referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These securities involve
greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less
liquid, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities
may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Trust
believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more
volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more
difficult to value and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
original offering prospectus, with additional information


                                                                              35

included in the Trust's shareowner reports from time to time. Please refer to
those documents when considering the Trust's risks. At times, the Trust's
investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated
or have common risks, making it more susceptible to any economic, political, or
regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries and sectors.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.  Security Valuation

    Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Investments in Senior
    Loans are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of
    Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from
    one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation.
    For the limited number of Senior Loans for which no reliable price quotes
    are available, such investments will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
    through the use of pricing matrices to determine valuations.

    Fixed-income securities are valued at prices supplied by independent pricing
    services, which consider such factors as Treasury spreads, yields,
    maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by values obtained
    from dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities are valued at
    the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded.
    Securities or loans for which quotations are not readily available are
    valued using fair values methods pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board
    of Trustees. Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each
    day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of such
    securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are
    determined


36
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    as of such times. The Trust may also use the fair value of a security,
    including a non-U.S. security, when the closing market price on the
    primary exchange where the security is traded no longer accurately
    reflects the value of the security as of the close of the exchange.
    Temporary cash investments are valued at amortized cost which approximates
    market value.

    Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
    dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
    passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
    data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Discount and premium on debt
    securities are accreted or amortized, respectively, daily, on an effective
    yield to maturity basis and are included in interest income. Interest
    income, including income on interest bearing cash accounts, is recorded on
    an accrual basis.

    Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
    cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.  Foreign Currency Translation

    The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
    denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
    current exchange rates.

    Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent,
    among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign currency
    contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between
    the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
    Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
    investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
    effects of changes in market price of those securities but are included
    with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C.  Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

    The Trust enters into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
    the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
    future date as a hedge or cross-hedge against either specific investment
    transactions (settlement hedges) or portfolio positions (portfolio
    hedges). All contracts are marked to market


                                                                              37

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    daily at the applicable exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized gains
    or losses are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust
    records realized gains and losses at the time a portfolio hedge is offset
    by entry into a closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the
    currency. Risks may arise upon entering into these contracts from the
    potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contract
    and from unanticipated movements in the value of foreign currencies
    relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 3).

D.  Federal Income Taxes

    It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
    distribute all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if
    any, to its shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
    required. All tax returns filed thus far are subject to examination by tax
    authorities.

    The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
    financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal
    income tax rules. Therefore, the source of the Trust's distributions may
    be shown in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in
    excess of net investment income or net realized gain on investment
    transactions, or from paid-in capital, depending on the type of book/tax
    differences that may exist.

    The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and
    preferred shareowners will be determined at the end of the fiscal year.
    Distributions during the year ended November 30, 2007 were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

    The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized depreciation is
    primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
    methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income securities, the
    realization for tax purposes of unrealized losses on certain foreign
    currency contracts and the deferral of post October capital losses for tax
    purposes.

E.  Repurchase Agreements

    With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
    of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest
    received from counterparties, is required to be at least equal to or in
    excess of the repurchase agreement at the time of purchase. The collateral
    for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
    account of the Trust's custodian, or subcustodians. The Trust's investment
    adviser, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("PIM"), is responsible for
    determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to the
    repurchase price.

F.  Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

    All common shareowners automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend
    Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), under which participants receive all
    dividends and capital gain distributions (collectively, "dividends") in
    full and fractional common shares of the Trust in lieu of cash.
    Shareowners may elect not to participate in the Plan. Shareowners not
    participating in the Plan receive all dividends and capital gain
    distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary
    and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by notifying
    American Stock Transfer & Trust


                                                                              39

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5/31/08 (unaudited)                    (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Company, the agent for shareowners in administering the Plan (the "Plan
    Agent"), in writing prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
    termination or resumption will be effective with respect to any
    subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

    Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
    participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
    acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional
    unissued but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase
    of outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
    If, on the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common
    share is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated
    brokerage trading fees ("market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the
    dividend amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued
    common shares to be credited to each account will be determined by
    dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per
    common share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum
    discount from the then current market price per share on the date of
    issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend, the
    net asset value per common share is greater than the market value ("market
    discount"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in common
    shares acquired in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges
    with respect to newly issued common shares. However, each participant will
    pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to
    the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not
    relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be
    due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares
    in a brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to another
    broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("PIM"), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary
of UniCredit S.p.A. ("UniCredit") manages the Trust's portfolio. Management
fees payable under the Trust's Advisory Agreement with PIM are calculated daily
at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets.
"Managed assets" is the average daily value of the Trust's total assets minus
the sum of the Trust's liabilities, which liabilities exclude debt related to
leverage,


40
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

short-term debt and the aggregate liquidation preference of any outstanding
preferred shares. For the six months ended May 31, 2008, the net management fee
was equivalent to 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was
equivalent to 1.12% of the Trust's average daily net assets attributable to the
common shareowners.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. Included
in "Due to affliates" reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities is
$407,551 in management costs, administrative cost and certain other fees
payable to PIM at May 31, 2008.

PIM has retained Princeton Administrators, LLC ("Princeton") to provide certain
administrative and accounting services to the Trust on its behalf. PIM pays
Princeton a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the average daily value
of the Trust's managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily
managed assets in excess of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly fee of
$10,000. Princeton receives no compensation directly from the Trust.

PIM has engaged Highland Capital Management, L.P. to act as the Trust's
investment sub-adviser ("Sub-adviser") and manage the Trust's investments. PIM
pays the Sub-adviser a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.35% of the average
daily value of the Trust managed assets. The fee is paid monthly in arrears.
The Trust does not pay a fee to the Sub-adviser.

Also, PIM has agreed for the first three years of the Trust's investment
operations (December 23, 2004 - December 23, 2007) to limit the Trust's total
annual expenses excluding offering costs for common and preferred shares,
interest expense, the cost of defending or prosecuting any claim or litigation
to which the Trust is a party (together with any amount in judgment or
settlement), indemnification expenses or taxes incurred due to the failure of
the Trust to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Code or any
other non-recurring or non-operating expenses; to 0.95% of the Trust's average
daily managed assets. The dividend on any preferred shares is not an expense
for this purpose. For the six months ended May 31, 2008 the Trust's expenses
were not reduced under such arrangements. As of December 23, 2007, this expense
limitation is no longer in effect.


                                                                              41

3. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver
currencies at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract, the Trust
must make delivery of the foreign currency. Alternatively, prior to the
settlement date of a portfolio hedge, the Trust may close out such contracts by
entering into an offsetting hedge contract. At May 31, 2008, the Trust had no
outstanding portfolio hedges or forward currency settlement contracts.

4. Unfunded Loan Commitments

As of May 31, 2008, the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of approximately
$6,441,000 which could be extended at the option of the borrower, pursuant to
the following loan agreements:

owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit , through a sub-transfer agency
agreement with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially
all transfer agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares
at negotiated rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("Deutsche Bank") is
the transfer agent, registrar, dividend paying agent and auction agent with
respect to the Trust's Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"). The

6. Trust Shares

There are an unlimited number of common shares of beneficial interest
authorized.

Transactions in common shares of beneficial interest for the six months ended
May 31, 2008 and the year ended November 30, 2007 were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares of beneficial
interest into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As
of May 31, 2008 there were 9,380 AMPS as follows: Series M7-3,130, Series
W7-3,125 and Series TH7-3,125.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. An auction fails
if there are more AMPS offered than there are buyers. When an auction fails,
the dividend rate for the period will be the maximum rate on the auction dates
described in the prospectus for the AMPS. You will not be able to sell your
AMPS at an auction if the auction fails. Since February 13, 2008, the Trust's
auctions related to the AMPS have failed. The maximum rate for the 7-Day Series
is 1.25% spread, over, or 125% of (the greater of) the one week LIBOR rate.
Dividend rates ranged from 3.50% to 6.10% during the six months ended May 31,
2008.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the outstanding
preferred shares would be less than 200%.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any


                                                                              43

accumulated or unpaid dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also
subject to mandatory redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or
unpaid dividends, whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to
the composition of the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. However, holders of AMPS are also entitled to
elect two of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might
otherwise be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any
outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required
to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the
preferred shares and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders,
including, among other things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a
closed-end investment company or changes in its fundamental investment
restrictions.

7. New Pronouncements

In March 2008, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures
about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS 161"), was issued
and is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161
requires enhanced disclosures about an entity's derivative and hedging
activities. Management is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS
161 will have on the Trust's financial statement disclosures.

8. Subsequent Event

Subsequent to May 31, 2008, the Board of Trustees of the Trust declared a
dividend from undistributed net investment income of $0.115 per common share
payable June 30, 2008 to common shareowners of record on June 16, 2008.

Subsequent to May 31, 2008, dividends declared and paid on preferred shares
totaled $751,855 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share series
through July 8, 2008.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (unaudited)

During the period, there were no material changes in the Trust's investment
objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                 firm, the scope of the Audit

                 increase.  The Services are

  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common

270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the

following an internal review which identified

performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.
