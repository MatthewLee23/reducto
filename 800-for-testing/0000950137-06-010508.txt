VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH
MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

                                                                               1

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

The 12-month period ended July 31, 2006 was quite favorable for the senior loan
asset class. Economic growth was solid, inflation remained in check, and the
credit market showed overall strength with many corporations posting good
profits, increasing revenues and improving credit quality. In addition, interest
rates continued to climb as the Federal Open Market Committee (the "Fed") raised
the target federal funds rate by 25 basis points at each of its meetings during
the reporting period, bringing the target rate to 5.25 percent at the end of
June 2006. The rising-rate environment was particularly beneficial to the senior
loan market as the yields on the loans adjust in tandem to short-term interest
rates.

Yield spreads in the senior loan market were relatively steady during the first
half of the reporting year, then began to widen in March. These widening spreads
in the latter half of the period added to the attractiveness of senior loans,
spurring demand from both institutional and individual investors.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. For the 12 months ended July 31, 2006, the trust returned 10.41 percent
on a market price basis and 6.54 percent on an NAV basis.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information.

We continued to follow our research-intensive investment approach, seeking to
balance yield with a stable net asset value. Our investment process remained
focused on identifying companies with strong management, solid and predictable
cash flows, and sufficient collateral in the event of default.

<PAGE>

Throughout the reporting period, we continued to employ a bottom-up security
selection process driven by analysis of individual company fundamentals. We do,
however, analyze overall sector and industry trends as well, which led us to
position the trust somewhat defensively during the period. For example, we
favored investments in less cyclical sectors such as food and drug, cable,
leisure and entertainment, and the defense industry. These sectors have
historically experienced steady demand for goods and services. In addition, we
generally avoided investing in companies that we believed to be vulnerable to
cyclical economic downturns or rising fuel prices, particularly the auto and
airline industries. We also remained cautious about the health care sector,
which has been struggling due to reductions in Medicaid reimbursements.

The trust benefited during the period from our use of leverage. Leverage
involves borrowing at a short-term lending rate and reinvesting the proceeds at
a higher rate. We used this strategy on an ongoing basis in an effort to enhance
the trust's dividend. Unlike other fixed-income classes, using leverage in
conjunction with senior loans does not involve the same degree of risk from
rising short-term interest rates, since the income from senior loans adjusts to
changes in interest rates, as do the rates which determine the trust's borrowing
costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates fall, borrowing costs would also
decline.) We might reduce leverage in periods of weaker credit quality
conditions to prevent magnifying erosion of the trust's net asset value.

The trust's procedure for reinvesting all dividends and distributions in common
shares is through purchases in the open market. This method helps support the
market value of the trust's shares. In addition, we would like to remind you
that the Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the trust may, when
appropriate, purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions at a price not above market value or net asset value, whichever is
lower at the time of purchase.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in
the future.

                                                                               3

CHANGES IN INVESTMENT POLICIES

At a meeting held on March 1, 2006, the Board of Trustees approved changes to
certain of the Trust's investment policies in order to expand the investment
options available to the Trust as the Trust seeks to achieve its investment
objective of high level of current income, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust's investment policy of investing at least 80% of its total
assets in Senior Loans remains unchanged. The changes to the Trust's investment
policies are as follows:

(1) The Trust may, subject to the limits specified below, invest in
credit-linked deposits. Credit-linked deposits are deposits by lenders, such as
the Trust, to support the issuance of letters of credit to the Senior Loan
borrower. The Trust receives from the bank issuing such letters of credit an
agreed upon rate of return in exchange for its deposit. There are risks
associated with credit-linked deposits, including the credit risk of the bank
which maintains the deposit account as well as the credit risk of the borrower.
The Trust bears the risk of possible loss of its principal investment, in
addition to the periodic interest payments that are expected to be received for
the duration of the Trust's investment in the credit-linked deposit. Thus,
restating the Trust's investment policies to include this new investment: The
Trust may invest up to 20% of its total assets in any combination of (1)
warrants and equity securities, in each case the Trust must own or acquire a
Senior Loan of the same issuer, (2) junior debt securities or securities with a
lien on collateral lower than a senior claim on collateral, (3) high quality
short-term debt securities, (4) credit-linked deposits and (5) Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities ("U.S. TIPS") and other inflation-indexed bonds
issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities.

(2) The Trust's ability to invest in structured products has been increased to
10% of its total assets and expanded to include credit default swaps ("CDS") to
enhance the yield on its portfolio or to increase income available for
distributions or for other non-hedging purposes. A CDS is an agreement between
two parties to exchange the credit risk of a particular issuer or reference
entity. In a CDS transaction, a buyer pays periodic fees in return for a payment
by the seller which is contingent upon an adverse credit event occurring in the
underlying issuer or reference entity. The seller collects periodic fees from
the buyer and profits if the credit of the underlying issuer or reference entity
remains stable or improves while the swap is outstanding, but the seller in a
CDS contract would be required to pay an agreed upon amount to the buyer in the
event of an adverse credit event in the reference entity. A buyer of a CDS is
said to buy protection whereas a seller of a CDS is said to sell protection.
When the Trust buys a CDS, it is utilizing the swap for hedging purposes similar
to other hedging strategies described herein. When the Trust sells a CDS, it is
utilizing the swap to enhance the yield on its portfolio to increase income
available for distribution or for other non-hedging purposes, and the Trust is
subject to the 10% limitation described herein on structured products.

Investment Advisory Agreement Approval

Both the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the terms of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement require that the investment advisory agreement between the
Fund and its investment adviser be approved annually both by a majority of the
Board of Trustees and by a majority of the independent trustees voting
separately.

On May 22, 2006, the Board of Trustees, and the independent trustees voting
separately, determined that the terms of the investment advisory agreement are
fair and reasonable and approved the continuance of the investment advisory
contract as being in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. In
making its determination, the Board of Trustees considered materials that were
specifically prepared by the investment adviser at the request of the Board and
Fund counsel, and by an independent provider of investment company data
contracted to assist the Board, relating to the contract review process. The
Board also considered information received periodically about the portfolio,
performance, the investment strategy, portfolio management team and fees and
expenses of the Fund. The Board of Trustees considered the contract over a
period of several months and the non-management trustees held sessions both with
the investment adviser and separate from the investment adviser in reviewing and
considering the contract.

In approving the investment advisory agreement, the Board of Trustees
considered, among other things, the nature, extent and quality of the services
provided by the investment adviser, the performance, fees and expenses of the
Fund compared to other similar funds and other products, the investment
adviser's expenses in providing the services and the profitability of the
investment adviser and its affiliated companies. The Board of Trustees
considered the extent to which any economies of scale experienced by the
investment adviser are shared with the Fund's shareholders, and the propriety of
breakpoints in the Fund's investment advisory fee schedule. The Board of
Trustees considered comparative advisory fees of the Fund and other investment
companies and/or other products at different asset levels, and considered the
trends in the industry. The Board of Trustees evaluated other benefits the
investment adviser and its affiliates derive from their relationship with the
Fund. The Board of Trustees reviewed information about the foregoing factors and
considered changes, if any, in such information since its previous approval. The
Board of Trustees discussed the financial strength of the investment adviser and
its affiliated companies and the capability of the personnel of the investment
adviser, and specifically the strength and background of its portfolio
management personnel. The Board of Trustees reviewed the statutory and
regulatory requirements for approval and disclosure of investment advisory
agreements. The Board of Trustees, including the independent trustees, evaluated
all of the foregoing and does not believe any single factor or group of factors
control or dominate the review process, and, after considering all factors
together, has determined, in the exercise of its business judgment, that
approval

                                                                               9

of the investment advisory agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and
its shareholders. The following summary provides more detail on certain matters
considered but does not detail all matters considered.

Nature, Extent and Quality of the Services Provided. On a regular basis, the
Board of Trustees considers the roles and responsibilities of the investment
adviser as a whole and for those specific portfolio management, support and
trading functions servicing the Fund. The trustees discuss with the investment
adviser the resources available and used in managing the Fund. The trustees also
discuss certain other services which are provided on a cost-reimbursement basis
by the investment adviser or its affiliates to the Van Kampen funds including
certain accounting, administrative and legal services. The Board has determined
that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the investment
adviser support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Performance, Fees and Expenses of the Fund. On a regular basis, the Board of
Trustees reviews the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund compared to its
peers and to appropriate benchmarks. In addition, the Board spends more focused
time on the performance of the Fund and other funds in the Van Kampen complex,
paying specific attention to underperforming funds. The trustees discuss with
the investment adviser the performance goals and the actual results achieved in
managing the Fund. When considering a fund's performance, the trustees and the
investment adviser place emphasis on trends and longer-term returns (focusing on
one-year, three-year and five-year performance with special attention to
three-year performance) and, when a fund's weighted performance is under the
fund's benchmark, they discuss the causes and where necessary seek to make
specific changes to investment strategy or investment personnel. The Fund
discloses more information about its performance elsewhere in this report and in
the Fund's prospectus. The trustees discuss with the investment adviser the
level of advisory fees for this Fund relative to comparable funds and other
products advised by the adviser and others in the marketplace. The trustees
review not only the advisory fees but other fees and expenses (whether paid to
the adviser, its affiliates or others) and the Fund's overall expense ratio. The
Board has determined that the performance, fees and expenses of the Fund support
its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Investment Adviser's Expenses in Providing the Service and Profitability. At
least annually, the trustees review the investment adviser's expenses in
providing services to the Fund and other funds advised by the investment adviser
and the profitability of the investment adviser. These profitability reports are
put together by the investment adviser with the oversight of the Board. The
trustees discuss with the investment adviser its revenues and expenses,
including among other things, revenues for advisory services, portfolio
management-related expenses, revenue sharing arrangement costs and allocated
expenses both on an aggregate basis and per fund. The Board has determined that
the analysis of the

<PAGE>

investment adviser's expenses and profitability support its decision to approve
the investment advisory contract.

Economies of Scale. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees considers the size
of the Fund and how that relates to the Fund's expense ratio and particularly
the Fund's advisory fee rate. In conjunction with its review of the investment
adviser's profitability, the trustees discuss with the investment adviser how
more (or less) assets can affect the efficiency or effectiveness of managing the
Fund's portfolio and whether the advisory fee level is appropriate relative to
current asset levels and/or whether the advisory fee structure reflects
economies of scale as asset levels change. The Board has determined that its
review of the actual and potential economies of scale of the Fund support its
decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

Other Benefits of the Relationship. On a regular basis, the Board of Trustees
considers other benefits to the investment adviser and its affiliates derived
from its relationship with the Fund and other funds advised by the investment
adviser. These benefits include, among other things, fees for transfer agency
services provided to the funds, in certain cases research received by the
adviser generated from commission dollars spent on funds' portfolio trading, and
in certain cases distribution or service related fees related to funds' sales.
The trustees review with the investment adviser each of these arrangements and
the reasonableness of its costs relative to the services performed. The Board
has determined that the other benefits received by the investment adviser or its
affiliates support its decision to approve the investment advisory contract.

                                                                              11

NR--Not rated

+    Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
     Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade. Bank
     loan ratings are unaudited.

     Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets
     applicable to common shares.

(a)  This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(b)  A portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
     commitments.

(c)  This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d)  Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(e)  Non-income producing security as this stock or warrant currently does not
     declare dividends.

(f)  Restricted Security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
     senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
     deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time,
     the company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated
     with registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents
     0.02% of the net assets applicable to common shares of the Trust.

(g)  Payment-in-kind security.

(h)  Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
     2006.

(i)  This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(j)  The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
     this loan.

(k)  144A securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule
     144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only
     be resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally those
     transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(l)  Security purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis.

(m)  Subsequent to July 31, 2006, this borrower has filed for protection in
     federal bankruptcy court.

*    Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
     and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment
     conditions and because there may be significant economic incentives for a
     Borrower to prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio
     may occur. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held
     in the Trust's portfolio may be substantially less than the stated
     maturities shown. Although the Trust is unable to accurately estimate the
     actual remaining maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust estimates
     that the actual average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio
     will be approximately 18-24 months.

**   Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
     which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate
     plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
     offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
     Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
     United States banks and (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
     are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
     contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
     Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JULY 31, 2006

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to seek
to provide a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a
portfolio of interests in floating or variable rate senior loans to
corporations, partnerships and other entities which operate in a variety of
industries and geographical regions. The Trust borrows money for investment
purposes which will create the opportunity for enhanced return, but also should
be considered a speculative technique and may increase the Trust's volatility.
The Trust commenced investment operations on June 24, 1998.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans and notes are valued by the Trust
following valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the
Trust's Board of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans and
notes for which reliable market quotes are readily available are valued at the
mean of such bid and ask quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily
available, Senior Loans and notes are valued, where possible, using independent
market indicators provided by independent pricing sources approved by the Board
of Trustees. Other Senior Loans and notes are valued by independent pricing
sources approved by the Board of Trustees based upon pricing models developed,
maintained and operated by those pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") by considering a number of factors including
consideration of market indicators, transactions in instruments which the
Adviser believes may be comparable (including comparable credit quality,
interest rate, interest rate redetermination period and maturity), the credit
worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the period until next
interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such Senior Loan.
Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial paper, negotiable
certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate securities which have
adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The
fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by the Trust's Valuation
Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon

                                                                              45

custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the underlying
security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses. The Trust
may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery" basis,
with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so purchased
is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will segregate
assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to the amount
of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until payment is
made. At July 31, 2006, the Trust had $1,500,000 of when-issued or delayed
delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees received are
treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note, or other
fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees
which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for
agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2006, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $218,138,489, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are to be distributed at least annually to common shareholders.
Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term
capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid for the years ended July 31, 2006
and 2005 were as follows:

</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and appropriately
reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Permanent differences
related to book to tax amortization differences and currency gain reclasses
totaling $781,384 and $471, respectively, have been reclassified from
accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized
loss.

    As of July 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $6,082,285
</Table>

    Net realized gains and losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions and post October losses which are not realized for tax
purposes until the first day of the following fiscal year.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

                                                                              47

securities.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the costs of purchases and proceeds from investments sold and
repaid, excluding short-term investments, were $2,124,854,332 and
$2,101,931,457, respectively.

4. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain Senior Loan agreements, the Trust had unfunded
loan commitments of approximately $138,669,100 as of July 31, 2006. The Trust
intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating cash,
liquid securities and liquid Senior Loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $2,329,699 as of July 31, 2006 is reported
as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

5. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Trust invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party
to the primary lending syndicate of a Variable Rate Senior Loan interest to
United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and other entities. When
the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Trust and the borrower.

    At July 31, 2006, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Trust on a participation
basis.

6. BORROWINGS

The Trust may utilize financial leverage to the maximum extent allowable under
the 1940 Act, as amended. Under the 1940 Act, as amended, a fund generally may
not (i) borrow money greater than 33 1/3% of the fund's total assets or (ii)
issue preferred shares greater than 50% of the fund's total assets. In using a
combination of borrowing money and issuing preferred shares, the maximum
allowable leverage is somewhere between 33 1/3% and 50% (but in no event more
that 50%) of the fund's total assets based on the relative amounts borrowed or
preferred shares issued.

    The Trust has entered into a $700 million revolving credit and security
agreement. Annual commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of
the credit line. This revolving credit agreement is secured by the assets of the
Trust. For the year ended July 31, 2006, the average daily balance of borrowings
under the revolving credit agreement was $564,380,165 with a weighted average
interest rate of 4.30%.

                                                                              49

7. PREFERRED SHARES ISSUANCE

As of February 20, 2004 , the Trust issued 5,600 shares each of Series M, Series
T, Series W, Series TH and Series F Auction Preferred Shares (APS), $.01 Par
Value, $25,000 liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $700 million.
Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every seven
days through an auction process. The average rate in effect on July 31, 2006 was
5.066%. During the year ended July 31, 2006, the rates ranged from 3.200% to
5.270%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of the "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

9. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainly in Income Taxes -- an
interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position
must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The impact to the
Trust's financial statements, if and, is currently being assessed.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Van Kampen Senior Income Trust

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of July 31, 2006, the related statements of operations and cash
flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of July 31, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian,
brokers and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Senior Income Trust as of July 31, 2006, the results of its operations,
its cash flows, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for
the respective stated periods, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders who are participants in the Plan may have all distributions
of dividends and capital gains automatically reinvested in Common Shares of the
Trust. Common Shareholders who elect not to participate in the Plan will receive
all distributions of dividends and capital gains in cash paid by check mailed
directly to the Common Shareholder by the Trust's dividend disbursing agent.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as your Plan Agent, serves as agent for
the Common Shareholders in administering the Plan. After the Trust declares a
dividend or determines to make a capital gains distribution, the Plan Agent
will, as agent for the participants, receive the cash payment and use it to buy
Common Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. The Trust will not issue any new Common Shares
in connection with the Plan. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common
Shares, carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written
notice of the change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 30
days before the record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may
be amended or terminated by the Plan Agent, with the written consent of the
Trust, by providing at least 30 days written notice to all Participants in the
Plan.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

              AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004(1)

1.   STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

     The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.(2)

     The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

     For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether
such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The
Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent Auditors are best
positioned to provide the most effective and efficient services, for reasons
such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people, culture, accounting
systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance
the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. All such
factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor should necessarily be
determinative.

     The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees for
audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

     The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and
All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval

- ----------
(1)  This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy
     and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above, supercedes and
     replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from time to time.

(2)  Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
     meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

     The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

     The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes that
implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent Auditors'
independence.

2.   DELEGATION

     As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.

3.   AUDIT SERVICES

     The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

     In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1.
All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

4.   AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

     Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in Appendix
B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

5.   TAX SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee believes it may grant
general pre-approval to those Tax services that have historically been provided
by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee has reviewed and believes
would not impair the independence of the Independent Auditors, and that are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee
will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in connection with a
transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors, the sole business
purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be
supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit
Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to determine that
the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this policy.

     Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved
the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large and complex
transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies).

6.   ALL OTHER SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

     A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.

7.   PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

     Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided
by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit Committee.
Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require specific
pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of the
overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

<PAGE>

8.   PROCEDURES

     All requests or applications for services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed
description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief Financial Officer
will determine whether such services are included within the list of services
that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by
the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to provide services that
require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit
Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's Chief Financial
Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the
request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence.

     The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to
monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and
to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.

9.   ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual
basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent Auditors
and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as reviewing a
formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating all
relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10.  COVERED ENTITIES

     Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

     -    Van Kampen Investments Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Asset Management

     -    Van Kampen Advisors Inc.

     -    Van Kampen Funds Inc.

     -    Morgan Stanley Trust Company

     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Ltd.

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

<PAGE>

are determined to have a direct impact on the operations or financial reporting

committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

(f) Not applicable.

provision of services other than audit services performed by the auditors to the
Registrant and Covered Entities is compatible with maintaining the auditors'
independence in performing audit services.

in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act whose members are:

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
are as follows:

                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.   POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policy and
procedures for voting proxies ("Policy") with respect to securities held in the
accounts of clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary
investment management services and for which a MSIM entity has authority to vote
proxies. The Policy will be reviewed and, updated, as necessary, to address new
or revised proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by the Policy
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company,
Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP, Van Kampen Asset Management, and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each an "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will use its best efforts to vote proxies as part of its
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the
MSIM registered management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and
Advisor Funds)(collectively referred to herein as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM
Affiliate will vote proxies under this Policy (except for the Morgan Stanley KLD
Social Index Fund, which votes proxies pursuant to the Institutional Shareholder
Services' Social Investment Research Proxy Voting Guidelines) pursuant to
authority granted under its applicable investment advisory agreement or, in the
absence of such authority, as authorized by the Board of

<PAGE>

Directors or Trustees of the MSIM Funds. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies
if the "named fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for
itself, or in the case of an account not governed by ERISA, the investment
management or investment advisory agreement does not authorize the MSIM
Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in a prudent and diligent
manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients, including beneficiaries
of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for which the MSIM Affiliates
manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term investment
returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a client or its
fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a proxy voting policy. In these
situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's policy.

Proxy Research Services - Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass
Lewis (together with other proxy research providers as MSIM Affiliates may
retain from time to time, the "Research Providers") are independent advisers
that specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services
to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants,
and other institutional investors. The services provided include in-depth
research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While the MSIM
Affiliates may review and utilize the recommendations of the Research Providers
in making proxy voting decisions, they are in no way obligated to follow such
recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote execution,
reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A.
below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by the
Research Providers.

Voting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies - While the proxy voting process
is well established in the United States and other developed markets with a
number of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting
proxies of non-U.S. companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly
emerging markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent
a MSIM Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are
not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language
other than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder
meetings; (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's
jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote
proxies in person, (v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the
securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and
(vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney to facilitate
the MSIM Affiliate's voting instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies
will be voted on a best efforts basis only, after weighing the costs and
benefits to MSIM's clients of voting such proxies, consistent with the Client
Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to provide assistance to the MSIM
Affiliates in connection with voting their clients' non-U.S. proxies.

II.  GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) this Policy,
including the guidelines set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range
of issues, including board size and composition, executive compensation,
anti-takeover proposals, capital structure proposals and social responsibility
issues and are meant to be general voting parameters on issues that arise most
frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however, may, pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section IV. below, vote in a manner that is not in accordance with the
following general guidelines, provided the vote is approved by the Proxy Review
Committee and is consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. Morgan Stanley AIP
GP LP will follow the procedures as described in Appendix A. A MSIM Affiliate
will not generally vote a proxy if it has sold the affected security between the
record date and the meeting date.

<PAGE>

III. GUIDELINES

A. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS. The following proposals will generally be voted
as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     i. General.

     1.   Generally, routine management proposals will be supported. The
          following are examples of routine management proposals:

          -    Approval of financial statements, director and auditor reports.

          -    General updating/corrective amendments to the charter.

          -    Proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting, except
               those proposals that relate to the "transaction of such other
               business which may come before the meeting."

     2.   Proposals to eliminate cumulative voting generally will be supported;
          proposals to establish cumulative voting in the election of directors
          will not be supported.

     3.   Proposals requiring confidential voting and independent tabulation of
          voting results will be supported.

     4.   Proposals requiring a U.S. company to have a separate Chairman and CEO
          will not be supported. Proposals requiring non-U.S. companies to have
          a separate Chairman and CEO will be supported.

     5.   Proposals by management of non-U.S. companies regarding items that are
          clearly related to the regular course of business will be supported.

     6.   Proposals to require the company to expense stock options will be
          supported.

     7.   Open-ended requests for adjournment generally will not be supported.
          However, where management specifically states the reason for
          requesting an adjournment and the requested adjournment is necessary
          to permit a proposal that would otherwise be supported under this
          Policy to be carried out (i.e. an uncontested corporate transaction),
          the adjournment request will be supported.

     8.   Proposals to declassify the Board of Directors (if management supports
          a classified board) generally will not be supported.

     9.   Proposal requiring that the company prepare reports that are costly to
          provide or that would require duplicative efforts or expenditures that
          are of a non-business nature or would provide no pertinent information
          from the perspective of institutional shareholders generally will not
          be supported.

     ii. Election of Directors. In situations where no conflict exists and where
     no specific governance deficiency has been noted, unless otherwise
     determined by the

<PAGE>

     Proxy Review Committee, proxies will be voted in support of nominees of
     management.

     1. The following proposals generally will be supported:

          -    Proposals requiring that a certain percentage (up to 66 2/3%) of
               the company's board members be independent directors.

          -    Proposals requiring that members of the company's compensation,
               nominating and audit committees be comprised of independent or
               unaffiliated directors.

     2. Unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee, a withhold
     vote will be made in the following circumstances:

          (a)  If a company's board is not comprised of a majority of
               disinsterested directors, a withhold vote will be made for
               interested directors. A director nominee may be deemed to be
               interested if the nominee has, or any time during the previous
               five years had, a relationship with the issuer (e.g., investment
               banker, counsel or other professional service provider, or
               familial relationship with a senior officer of the issuer) that
               may impair his or her independence;

          (b)  If a nominee who is interested is standing for election as a
               member of the company's compensation, nominating or audit
               committees;

          (c)  A direct conflict exists between the interests of the nominee and
               the public shareholders;

          (d)  Where the nominees standing for election have not taken action to
               implement generally accepted governance practices for which there
               is a "bright line" test. These would include elimination of dead
               hand or slow hand poison pills, requiring audit, compensation or
               nominating committees to be composed of independent directors and
               requiring a majority independent board;

          (e)  A nominee has failed to attend at least 75% of board meetings
               within a given year without a reasonable excuse; or

          (f)  A nominee serves on the board of directors for more than six
               companies (excluding investment companies).

     iii. Auditors

     1.   Generally, management proposals for selection or ratification of
          auditors will be supported. However, such proposals may not be
          supported if the fees paid to auditors are excessive. Generally, to
          determine if such fees are excessive, a 50% test will be applied:
          i.e., non-audit fees should be less than 50% of the total fees paid to
          the auditor.

<PAGE>

     2.   Proposals requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of
          shareholders will be supported.

     3.   Proposals to indemnify auditors will not be supported.

     iv. Anti-Takeover Matters

     1.   Proposals to modify or rescind existing supermajority vote
          requirements to amend the charter or bylaws will be supported;
          proposals to amend by-laws to require a supermajority shareholder vote
          to pass or repeal certain provisions will not be supported.

     2.   Proposals relating to the adoption of anti-greenmail provisions will
          be supported, provided that the proposal: (i) defines greenmail; (ii)
          prohibits buyback offers to large block holders (holders of at least
          1% of the outstanding shares and in certain cases, a greater amount,
          as determined by the Proxy Review Committee) not made to all
          shareholders or not approved by disinterested shareholders; and (iii)
          contains no anti-takeover measures or other provisions restricting the
          rights of shareholders.

     3.   Proposals requiring shareholder approval or ratification of a
          shareholder rights plan or poison pill will be supported.

B. CAPITALIZATION CHANGES. The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     1.   The following proposals generally will be supported:

          -    Proposals relating to capitalization changes that eliminate other
               classes of stock and/or eliminate unequal voting rights.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of
               common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) if:
               (i) a clear and legitimate business purpose is stated; (ii) the
               number of shares requested is reasonable in relation to the
               purpose for which authorization is requested; and (iii) the
               authorization does not exceed 100% of shares currently authorized
               and at least 30% of the new authorization will be outstanding.

          -    Proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or for
               issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued capital.

          -    Proposals for share repurchase plans.

          -    Proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares of common or
               preferred stock, or to eliminate classes of preferred stock.

          -    Proposals to effect stock splits.

          -    Proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management
               proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth in
               the corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do not adjust
               proportionately to the authorized share amount generally will be
               approved if the resulting increase in

<PAGE>

               authorized shares coincides with the proxy guidelines set forth
               above for common stock increases.

     2.   The following proposals generally will not be supported
          (notwithstanding management support).

          -    Proposals relating to capitalization changes that add classes of
               stock which substantially dilute the voting interests of existing
               shareholders.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares of existing
               classes of stock that carry preemptive rights or supervoting
               rights.

          -    Proposals to create "blank check" preferred stock.

          -    Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by 100% or more.

C. COMPENSATION. The following proposals generally will be voted as indicated
below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     1.   The following proposals generally will be supported:

          -    Proposals relating to director fees, provided the amounts are not
               excessive relative to other companies in the country or industry.

          -    Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that permit discounts
               up to 15%, but only for grants that are part of a broad-based
               employee plan, including all non-executive employees.

          -    Proposals for the establishment of employee stock option plans
               and other employee ownership plans, provided that our research
               does not indicate that approval of the plan would be against
               shareholder interest.

          -    Proposals for the establishment of employee retirement and
               severance plans, provided that our research does not indicate
               that approval of the plan would be against shareholder interest.

     2.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of all severance
          agreements will not be supported, however, proposals that require
          shareholder approval for agreements in excess of three times the
          annual compensation (salary and bonus) generally will be supported.

     3.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of executive
          compensation generally will not be supported.

     4.   Proposals that request or require disclosure of executive compensation
          in addition to the disclosure required by the Securities and Exchange
          Commission ("SEC") regulations generally will not be supported.

D. OTHER RECURRING ITEMS. The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

<PAGE>

     1.   Proposals to add restrictions related to social, political,
          environmental or special interest issues that do not relate directly
          to the business of the company and which do not appear to be directed
          specifically to the business or financial interest of the company
          generally will not be supported.

     2.   Proposals requiring adherence to workplace standards that are not
          required or customary in market(s) to which the proposals relate will
          not be supported.

E. ITEMS TO BE REVIEWED BY THE PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
substantive financial or best interest impact on an issuer, will be voted as
determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     i.   Corporate Transactions

          -    Proposals relating to mergers, acquisitions and other special
               corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of
               assets, reorganizations, restructurings and recapitalizations)
               will be examined on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, Research
               Providers' research and analysis will be used along with MSIM
               Affiliates' research and analysis, including, among other things,
               MSIM internal company-specific knowledge. Proposals for mergers
               or other significant transactions that are friendly and approved
               by the Research Providers generally will be supported where there
               is no portfolio manager objection and where there is no material
               conflict of interest and in those instances will not need to be
               reviewed by the Proxy Review Committee.

     ii.  Compensation

          -    Proposals relating to change-in-control provisions in non-salary
               compensation plans, employment contracts, and severance
               agreements that benefit management and would be costly to
               shareholders if triggered. With respect to proposals related to
               severance and change of control situations, MSIM Affiliates will
               support a maximum of three times salary and bonus.

          -    Proposals relating to Executive/Director stock option plans.
               Generally, stock option plans should be incentive based. The
               Proxy Review Committee will evaluate the the quantitative
               criteria used by a Research Provider when considering such
               Research Provider's recommendation. If the Proxy Review Committee
               determines that the criteria used by the Research Provider is
               reasonable, the proposal will be supported if it falls within a
               5% band above the Research Provider's threshold.

          -    Compensation proposals that allow for discounted stock options
               that have not been offered to employees in general.

     iii. Other

          -    Proposals for higher dividend payouts.

<PAGE>

          -    Proposals recommending set retirement ages or requiring specific
               levels of stock ownership by directors.

          -    Proposals for election of directors, where a director nominee is
               related to MSIM (i.e. on an MSIM Fund's Board of
               Directors/Trustees or part of MSIM senior management) must be
               considered by the Proxy Review Committee. If the proposal relates
               to a director nominee who is on a Van Kampen Fund's Board of
               Directors/Trustees, to the extent that the shares of the relevant
               company are held by a Van Kampen Fund, the Van Kampen Board shall
               vote the proxies with respect to those shares, to the extent
               practicable. In the event that the Committee cannot contact the
               Van Kampen Board in advance of the shareholder meeting, the
               Committee will vote such shares pursuant to the Proxy Voting
               Policy.

          -    Proposals requiring diversity of board membership relating to
               broad based social, religious or ethnic groups.

          -    Proposals to limit directors' liability and/or broaden
               indemnification of directors. Generally, the Proxy Review
               Committee will support such proposals provided that the officers
               and directors are eligible for indemnification and liability
               protection if they have acted in good faith on company business
               and were found innocent of any civil or criminal charges for
               duties performed on behalf of the company.

F. FUND OF FUNDS. Certain Funds advised by an MSIM Affiliate invest only in
other MSIM funds. If an underlying fund has a shareholder meeting, in order to
avoid any potential conflict of interest, such proposals will be voted in the
same proportion as the votes of the other shareholders of the underlying fund,
unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

IV.  ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

A.   PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

     1.   The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible for
          creating and implementing the Policy and, in this regard, has
          expressly adopted it.

          (a)  The Committee, which is appointed by MSIM's Chief Investment
               Officer ("CIO"), consists of senior investment professionals who
               represent the different investment disciplines and geographic
               locations of the firm. The Committee is responsible for
               establishing MSIM's Policy and determining how MSIM will vote
               proxies on an ongoing basis.

          (b)  The Committee will periodically review and have the authority to
               amend, as necessary, the Policy and establish and direct voting
               positions consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

          (c)  The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other
               matters): (1) address any outstanding issues relating to the
               Policy and (2) review proposals at upcoming shareholder meetings
               of MSIM portfolio

<PAGE>

               companies in accordance with this Policy including, as
               appropriate, the voting results of prior shareholder meetings of
               the same issuer where a similar proposal was presented to
               shareholders. The Committee, or its designee, will timely
               communicate to ISS MSIM's Policy (and any amendments to them
               and/or any additional guidelines or procedures it may adopt).

          (d)  The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other
               matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing certain
               shares of the same issuer that are the subject of the same proxy
               solicitation and held by one or more MSIM portfolios to be voted
               differently than other shares) and/or "override voting" (i.e.,
               voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner contrary to the
               Policy); (2) review and approve upcoming votes, as appropriate,
               for matters for which specific direction has been provided in
               this Policy; and (3) determine how to vote matters for which
               specific direction has not been provided in this Policy. Split
               votes generally will not be approved within a single Global
               Investor Group investment team. The Committee may take into
               account Research Providers' recommendations and research as well
               as any other relevant information they may request or receive,
               including portfolio manager and/or analyst research, as
               applicable. Generally, proxies related to securities held in
               accounts that are managed pursuant to quantitative, index or
               index-like strategies ("Index Strategies") will be voted in the
               same manner as those held in actively managed accounts. Because
               accounts managed using Index Strategies are passively managed
               accounts, research from portfolio managers and/or analysts
               related to securities held in these accounts may not be
               available. If the affected securities are held only in accounts
               that are managed pursuant to Index Strategies, and the proxy
               relates to a matter that is not described in this Policy, the
               Committee will consider all available information from the
               Research Providers, and to the extent that the holdings are
               significant, from the portfolio managers and/or analysts.

          (e)  In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the Committee
               determines that an issue raises a potential material conflict of
               interest, or gives rise to the appearance of a potential material
               conflict of interest, the Committee will request a special
               committee to review, and recommend a course of action with
               respect to, the conflict(s) in question ("Special Committee").
               The Special Committee shall be comprised of the Chairperson of
               the Proxy Review Committee, the Compliance Director for the area
               of the firm involved or his/her designee, a senior portfolio
               manager (if practicable, one who is a member of the Proxy Review
               Committee) designated by the Proxy Review Committee, and MSIM's
               Chief Investment Officer or his/her designee. The Special
               Committee may request the assistance of MSIM's General Counsel or
               his/her designee and will have sole discretion to cast a vote. In
               addition to the research provided by Research Providers, the
               Special Committee may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate
               investment professionals and outside sources to the extent it
               deems appropriate.

<PAGE>

          (f)  The Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s),
               will document in writing all of their decisions and actions,
               which documentation will be maintained by the Committee and the
               Special Committee, or their designee(s), for a period of at least
               6 years. To the extent these decisions relate to a security held
               by a MSIM U.S. registered investment company, the Committee and
               Special Committee, or their designee(s), will report their
               decisions to each applicable Board of Trustees/Directors of those
               investment companies at each Board's next regularly scheduled
               Board meeting. The report will contain information concerning
               decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee during the
               most recently ended calendar quarter immediately preceding the
               Board meeting.

          (g)  The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s), will
               timely communicate to applicable portfolio managers, the
               Compliance Departments and, as necessary, to ISS, decisions of
               the Committee and Special Committee so that, among other things,
               ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

B. IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     1.   If there is a possibility that a vote may involve a material conflict
          of interest, the vote must be decided by the Special Committee in
          consultation with MSIM's General Counsel or his/her designee.

     2.   A material conflict of interest could exist in the following
          situations, among others:

     (a)  The issuer soliciting the vote is a client of MSIM or an affiliate of
          MSIM and the vote is on a material matter affecting the issuer;

     (b)  The proxy relates to Morgan Stanley common stock or any other security
          issued by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates; or

     (c)  Morgan Stanley has a material pecuniary interest in the matter
          submitted for a vote (e.g., acting as a financial advisor to a party
          to a merger or acquisition for which Morgan Stanley will be paid a
          success fee if completed).

C.   PROXY VOTING REPORTS

     (a)  MSIM will promptly provide a copy of this Policy to any client
          requesting them. MSIM will also, upon client request, promptly provide
          a report indicating how each proxy was voted with respect to
          securities held in that client's account.

     (b)  MSIM's legal department is responsible for filing an annual Form N-PX
          on behalf of each registered management investment company for which
          such filing is required, indicating how all proxies were voted with
          respect to such investment company's holdings.

Item 8. Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

                         VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

                                 FUND MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT. As of the date of this report, the Fund is managed by
members of the Taxable Fixed Income team. The team consists of portfolio
managers and analysts. Current members of the team jointly and primarily
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio and the
overall execution of the strategy of the Fund are Howard T. Tiffen, a Managing
Director of the Adviser and Christina Jamieson, an Executive Director of the
Adviser.

Mr. Tiffen has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since December 1999 and began managing the Fund in December 1999. Ms.
Jamieson has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since March 2000 and began managing the Fund in June 2005.

The composition of the team may change from time to time.

OTHER ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

The following information is as of July 31, 2006.

As of July 31, 2006, Mr. Tiffen managed 6 mutual funds with a total of
approximately $5.7 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than
mutual funds; and 2 other accounts with a total of approximately $585.2 million
in assets.

As of June 30, 2006, Ms. Jamieson managed two mutual funds with a total of
approximately $4.0 billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than
mutual funds; and no other accounts.

Because the portfolio managers manage assets for other investment companies,
pooled investment vehicles, and/or other accounts (including institutional
clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals), there may be an
incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest.
For instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher
than the fee it receives from the Fund, or it may receive a performance-based
fee on certain accounts. In those instances, the portfolio manager may have an
incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the
Fund. The Adviser has adopted trade allocation and other policies and procedures
that it believes are reasonably designed to address these and other conflicts of
interest.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

Portfolio managers receive a combination of base compensation and discretionary
compensation, comprised of a cash bonus and several deferred compensation
programs described below. The methodology used to determine portfolio manager
compensation is applied across all funds/accounts managed by the portfolio
manager.

Base salary compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base salary
compensation based on the level of their position with the Adviser.

Discretionary compensation. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers
may receive discretionary compensation.

Discretionary compensation can include:

<PAGE>

- -    Cash Bonus.

- -    Morgan Stanley's Equity Incentive Compensation Program (EICP) awards -- a
     mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end
     compensation into restricted stock units or other awards based on Morgan
     Stanley common stock that are subject to vesting and other conditions.

- -    Investment Management Deferred Compensation Plan (IMDCP) awards -- a
     mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end
     compensation and notionally invests it in designated Funds advised by the
     Adviser or its affiliates. The award is subject to vesting and other
     conditions. Portfolio managers must notionally invest a minimum of 25% to a
     maximum of 75% of the IMDCP deferral into a combination of the designated
     open-end mutual funds they manage that are included in the IMDCP Fund menu,
     which may or may not include the Fund.

- -    Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans -- voluntary programs that permit
     certain employees to elect to defer a portion of their discretionary
     year-end compensation and directly or notionally invest the deferred
     amount: (1) across a range of designated investment Funds, including Funds
     advised by the Adviser or its affiliates; and/or (2) in Morgan Stanley
     stock units.

Several factors determine discretionary compensation, which can vary by
portfolio management team and circumstances. In order of relative importance,
these factors include:

- -    Investment performance. A portfolio manager's compensation is linked to the
     pre-tax investment performance of the funds/accounts managed by the
     portfolio manager. Investment performance is calculated for one-, three-
     and five-year periods measured against a fund's/account's primary
     benchmark, indices and/or peer groups where applicable. Generally, the
     greatest weight is placed on the three- and five-year periods.

- -    Revenues generated by the investment companies, pooled investment vehicles
     and other accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

- -    Contribution to the business objectives of the Adviser.

- -    The dollar amount of assets managed by the portfolio manager.

- -    Market compensation survey research by independent third parties.

- -    Other qualitative factors, such as contributions to client objectives.

- -    Performance of Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, and
     the overall performance of the investment team(s) of which the portfolio
     manager is a member.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003,

                AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 22, 2005

I.   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
     Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and each,
     a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, President,
     Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
     functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit B) for
     the purpose of promoting:

     -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships.

     -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     -    prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

<PAGE>

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
          indirectly);

     -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; or

     -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
          contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
          trade personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation
          of the market effect of such transactions.

     Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to the
General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships outside
the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

     Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

     -    service or significant business relationships as a director on the
          board of any public or private company;

     -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
          and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings, not
          including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting events
          or other similar entertainment;

<PAGE>

          provided it is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
          time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

     -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          thereof; and

     -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
          disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
          Funds;

     -    each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
          to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Directors/Trustees and
          auditors, or to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations;

     -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
          Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting full,
          fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports
          and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
          public communications made by the Funds; and

     -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
          Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     -    annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code;

     -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or any
          employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     -    notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any

<PAGE>

particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

     The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

     -    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to him;

     -    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
          violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
          any further action;

     -    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
          reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

     -    if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
          "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
          "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
          relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will consider
          appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
          recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other appropriate
          disciplinary actions;

     -    the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
          relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
          as appropriate; and

     -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

- ----------
(3)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion

I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.
