                                 PRIVACY NOTICE

The Eaton Vance organization is committed to ensuring your financial privacy.
Each of the financial institutions identified below has in effect the following
policy ("Privacy Policy") with respect to nonpublic personal information about
its customers:

 -   Only such information received from you, through application forms or
     otherwise, and information about your Eaton Vance fund transactions will be
     collected. This may include information such as name, address, social
     security, tax status, account balances and transactions.

 -   None of such information about you (or former customers) will be disclosed
     to anyone, except as permitted by law (which includes disclosure to
     employees necessary to service your account). In the normal course of
     servicing a customer's account, Eaton Vance may share information with
     unaffiliated third parties that perform various required services such as
     transfer agents, custodians and broker/dealers.

 -   Policies and procedures (including physical, electronic and procedural
     safeguards) are in place that are designed to protect the confidentiality
     of such information.

 -   We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time upon proper
     notification to you. Customers may want to review our Policy periodically
     for changes by accessing the link on our homepage: www.eatonvance.com.

Our pledge of privacy applies to the following entities within the Eaton Vance
organization: the Eaton Vance Family of Funds, Eaton Vance Management, Eaton
Vance Investment Counsel, Boston Management and Research, and Eaton Vance
Distributors, Inc.

In addition, our Privacy Policy only applies to those Eaton Vance customers who
are individuals and who have a direct relationship with us. If a customer's
account (i.e., fund shares) is held in the name of a third-party financial
adviser/broker-dealer, it is likely that only such adviser's privacy policies
apply to the customer. This notice supersedes all previously issued privacy
disclosures.

      For more information about Eaton Vance's Privacy Policy, please call
                                 1-800-262-1122.

                                IMPORTANT NOTICE
                              REGARDING DELIVERY OF
                              SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission permits funds to deliver only one copy of
shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements and shareholder
reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same residential or
post office box address. This practice is often called "householding" and it
helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER, MAY HOUSEHOLD THE MAILING OF YOUR
DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.


The Fund will file a schedule of its portfolio holdings on Form N-Q with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for the first and third quarters
of each fiscal year. The Fund's Form N-Q will be available on the Eaton Vance
website www.eatonvance.com, by calling Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122 or in the
EDGAR database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Form N-Q may also be
reviewed and copied at the SEC's public reference room in Washington, D.C. (call
1-800-732-0330 for information on the operation of the public reference room).


From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities
held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote
proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds' and
Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and
procedures and information on how the Fund or Portfolio voted proxies relating
to portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30 without charge,
upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122. This description is also available on
the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

EATON VANCE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE TRUST AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2004
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

THE TRUST

   PERFORMANCE FOR THE PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2004

- -  Based on the Trust's October 2004 monthly dividend of $0.093 and a closing
   share price of $19.94, the Trust had a market yield of 5.60%.(1) The Trust's
   market yield represented a yield advantage over many other income-producing
   vehicles during the period.

- -  Based on share price (traded on the New York Stock Exchange), the Trust had a
   total return of 9.45% for the period from inception on November 28, 2003
   through October 31, 2004. That return was the result of an increase in share
   price from $19.10 on November 28, 2003 to $19.94 on October 31, 2004 and the
   reinvestment of $0.900 in regular monthly dividends.(1)

- -  Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 4.13% for the
   period from inception on November 28, 2003 through October 31, 2004. That
   return was the result of a decrease in net asset value per share from $19.10
   on November 28, 2003 to $18.97 on October 31, 2004, and the reinvestment of
   all distributions.

- -  For performance comparison, the S&P/Loan Syndications and Trading Association
   (LSTA) Index , had a return of 4.90% for the period from November 28, 2003
   through October 31, 2004.(2)

   THE TRUST'S INVESTMENTS

- -  The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current
   income. The Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of
   capital to the extent consistent with its primary goal of high current
   income. The Trust invests primarily in senior secured floating-rate loans. As
   a result, the Trust may be well-positioned to take advantage of a rise in
   short-term interest rates. The Trust also employs leverage in the form of
   Auction Preferred Shares.(3)

    PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL
    AND ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET ASSET VALUE
    OR SHARE PRICE (AS APPLICABLE) WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. INVESTMENT
    RETURN AND PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO THAT SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY
    BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PERFORMANCE IS FOR THE
    STATED TIME PERIOD ONLY; DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY, THE FUND'S CURRENT
    PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE QUOTED RETURN.

- -  The Trust's senior floating-rate loan investments included 305 borrowers,
   ranging across 35 industries at October 31, 2004. The Trust's average loan
   size was just 0.26% of loan assets (based on net assets), and no industry
   constituted more than 11.0% of the Trust's loan investments. Automotive,
   telecommunications, leisure goods and activities, health care and publishing
   were the Trust's largest loan sector weightings.*

- -  Due to improving fundamentals and strong technical factors in the loan
   market, loan credit spreads for new issues narrowed and prices averaged
   above-par in the secondary market. These trends have increased the importance
   of diligent credit risk-management.

- -  In economically sensitive areas, the Trust included the publishing and
   printing sector, such as newspapers with relatively stable, locally-based
   advertising revenues. Examples of other cyclical investments were chemical
   companies and container and glass producers, which should benefit from
   increase demand.

- -  The Trust's high-yield corporate bond holdings constituted 17.1% of its net
   assets at October 31, 2004 (10.8% of total investments). This component
   provided a yield enhancement for the Trust and performed well during the past
   year.

- -  At October 31, 2004, the Trust had leverage in the amount of approximately
   38% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust uses leverage through the issuance
   of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for
   increased income, but, at the same time, creates special risks (including the
   likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of
   common shares).

    *HOLDINGS AND SECTOR WEIGHTINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE DUE TO ACTIVE
     MANAGEMENT.

   THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND
   ARE CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS STATED ON THE
   COVER. THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED UPON MARKET OR
   OTHER CONDITIONS, AND EATON VANCE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE SUCH
   VIEWS. THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE AND, BECAUSE
   INVESTMENT DECISIONS FOR AN EATON VANCE FUND ARE BASED ON MANY FACTORS, MAY
   NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF OF ANY EATON
   VANCE FUND.

 SHARES OF THE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC AND ARE NOT DEPOSITS OR
 OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. SHARES
 ARE SUBJECT TO INVESTMENT RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL
 INVESTED. YIELD WILL VARY.

(1)  THE TRUST'S MARKET YIELD IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE MOST RECENT DIVIDEND
     PER SHARE BY THE SHARE MARKET PRICE AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND
     ANNUALIZING THE RESULT. (2) IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO INVEST DIRECTLY IN AN
     INDEX. THE INDEX'S TOTAL RETURN DOES NOT REFLECT THE COMMISSIONS OR
     EXPENSES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCURRED IF AN INVESTOR INDIVIDUALLY
     PURCHASED OR SOLD THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED IN THE INDEX. (3) IN THE EVENT
     OF A RISE IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES, THE VALUE OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT
     PORTFOLIO COULD DECLINE, WHICH WOULD REDUCE THE ASSET COVERAGE FOR ITS
     AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES. (4) RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND ARE CALCULATED BY
     DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN SHARE PRICE OR NET ASSET VALUE WITH
     ALL DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. PERFORMANCE RESULTS REFLECT THE EFFECT OF
     LEVERAGE RESULTING FROM THE TRUST'S ISSUANCE OF AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES.

Note: The Trust has made commitments to fund specified amounts under certain
      existing credit arrangments. Pursuant to the terms of these arrangements,
      the Trust had unfunded loan commitments of $5,471,841 as of October 31,
      2004.

PIK - Payment In Kind.

(1)   Senior floating-rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash
      flows or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The degree to which
      borrowers repay, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
      election, cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual
      remaining maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities
      shown. However, it is anticipated that the senior floating-rate interests
      will have an expected average life of approximately two to three years.
      The stated interest rate represents the weighted average interest rate of
      all contracts within the senior loan facility.

(2)   Non-income producing security.

(3)   Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
      1933. These securities may be sold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. At October 31,
      2004, the aggregate value of the securities is $58,510,994 or 9.2% of the
      Trust's net assets.

(4)   Security valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or
      at the direction of the Trustees.

EATON VANCE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE TRUST as of October 31, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Senior Floating-Rate Trust (the Trust) is registered under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified closed-end
   management investment company. The Trust, which was organized as a
   Massachusetts business trust on August 5, 2003, seeks to provide a high level
   of current income. The Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek
   preservation of capital to the extent consistent with its primary goal of
   high current income. The Trust pursues its objectives by investing primarily
   in senior, secured floating rate loans (Senior Loans). The following is a
   summary of significant accounting policies of the Trust. The policies are in
   conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
   of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Certain senior loans are deemed to be liquid if
   reliable market quotations are readily available for them. Liquid Senior
   Loans are valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing service. Other
   Senior Loans are valued at fair value by the Trust's investment advisor,
   Eaton Vance Management (EVM), under procedures established by the Trustees as
   permitted by Section 2(a)(41) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Such
   procedures include the consideration of relevant factors, data and
   information relating to fair value, including (i) the characteristics of and
   fundamental analytical data relating to the Senior Loan, including the cost,
   size, current interest rate, period until next interest rate reset, maturity
   and base lending rate of the Senior Loan, the terms and conditions of the
   Senior Loan and any related agreements, and the position of the Senior Loan
   in the Borrower's debt structure; (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the
   collateral, including the Trust's rights, remedies and interests with respect
   to the collateral; (iii) the creditworthiness of the Borrower, based on an
   evaluation of its financial condition, financial statements and information
   about the Borrower's business, cash flows, capital structure and future
   prospects; (iv) information relating to the market for the Senior Loan,
   including price quotations for and trading in the Senior Loan, and interests
   in similar Senior Loans and the market environment and investor attitudes
   towards the Senior Loan and interests in similar Senior Loans; (v) the
   experience, reputation, stability and financial condition of the agent and
   any intermediate participant in the Senior Loan; and (vi) general economic
   and market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan. Other
   portfolio securities (other than short-term obligations, but including listed
   issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by one or more pricing
   services which determine prices for normal, institutional-size trading units
   of such securities which may use market information, transactions for
   comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are
   generally recognized by institutional traders. In certain circumstances,
   portfolio securities will be valued at the last sale price on the exchange
   that is the primary market for such securities, or the average of the last
   quoted bid price and asked price for those securities for which the
   over-the-counter market is the primary market or for listed securities in
   which there were no sales during the day. Marketable securities listed in the
   NASDAQ National Market System are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
   price. The value of swaps will be based on dealer quotations. Short-term
   obligations which mature in 60 days or less, are valued at amortized cost, if
   their original term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was 60 days or
   less or are valued at amortized cost using their value on the 61st day prior
   to maturity, if their original term to maturity when acquired by the Trust
   was more than 60 days, unless in each case this is determined not to
   represent fair value. OTC options are valued at the mean between bid and
   asked price provided by dealers. Financial futures contracts listed on
   commodity exchanges and exchange traded options are valued at closing
   settlement prices. Securities for which there is no such quotation or
   valuation are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by
   or at the direction of the Trustees. Repurchase agreements are valued at cost
   plus accrued interest. Other portfolio securities for which there are no
   quotations or valuations are valued at fair value as determined in good faith
   by or on behalf of the Trustees.

   B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual
   basis at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is
   determined on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of
   premium or accretion of discount. Dividend income is recorded on the
   ex-dividend date for dividends received in cash and/or securities.

   C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any
   net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal
   income or excise tax is necessary. At October 31, 2004, the Trust, for
   federal income tax purposes, had a capital loss carryover of $5,860,075 which
   will reduce the Trust's taxable income arising from future net realized gains
   on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code,
   and thus will reduce the amount of the distributions to shareholders

                                       23
<Page>

   which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trust of any liability for
   federal income or excise tax. Such capital loss carryover will expire on
   October 31, 2012.

   D INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Trust in connection with the
   offering of the common shares and preferred shares were recorded as a
   reduction of capital paid in excess of par applicable to common shares.

   F EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
   fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
   balance the Trust maintains with IBT. All credit balances used to reduce the
   Trust's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses on the
   Statement of Operations.

   G WRITTEN OPTIONS -- Upon the writing of a call or a put option, an amount
   equal to the premium received by the Trust is included in the Statement of
   Assets and Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the liability is
   subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
   written in accordance with the Trust's policies on investment valuations
   discussed above. Premiums received from writing options which expire are
   treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are
   exercised or are closed are added to or offset against the proceeds or amount
   paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. If a put
   option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities
   purchased by the Trust. The Trust, as writer of an option, may have no
   control over whether the underlying securities may be sold (call) or
   purchased (put) and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable
   change in the price of the securities underlying the written option.

   H PURCHASED OPTIONS -- Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the premium
   paid by the Trust is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as
   an investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently marked-to-market
   to reflect the current market value of the option purchased, in accordance
   with the Trust's policies on investment valuations discussed above. If an
   option which the Trust has purchased expires on the stipulated expiration
   date, the Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the option.
   If the Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, the Trust will realize a
   gain or loss, depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing sale
   transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option. If the Trust
   exercises a put option, it will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the
   underlying security, and the proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the
   premium originally paid. If the Trust exercises a call option, the cost of
   the security which the Trust purchases upon exercise will be increased by the
   premium originally paid.

   I FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon entering into a financial futures
   contract, the Trust is required to deposit an amount (initial margin) either
   in cash or securities equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by the Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying securities, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Trust.

   If the Trust enters into a closing transaction, the Trust will realize, for
   book purposes, a gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of
   the financial futures contract to sell and the financial futures contract to
   buy. The Trust's investment in financial futures contracts is designed only
   to hedge against anticipated future changes in interest rates. Should
   interest rates move unexpectedly, the Trust may not achieve the anticipated
   benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

   J REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- The Trust may enter into reverse
   repurchase agreements. Under such an agreement, the Trust temporarily
   transfers possession, but not ownership, of a security to a counterparty, in
   return for cash. At the same time, the Trust agrees to repurchase the
   security at an agreed-upon price and time in the future. The Trust may enter
   into reverse repurchase agreements for temporary purposes, such as to Trust
   withdrawals, or for use as hedging instruments where the underlying security
   is denominated in a foreign currency. As a form of leverage, reverse
   repurchase agreements may increase the risk of fluctuation in the market
   value of the Trust's assets or in its yield. Liabilities to counterparties
   under reverse repurchase agreements are recognized in the

                                       24
<Page>

   Statement of Assets and Liabilities at the same time at which cash is
   received by the Trust. The securities underlying such agreements continue to
   be treated as owned by the Trust and remain in the Portfolio of Investments.
   Interest charged on amounts borrowed by the Trust under reverse repurchase
   agreements is accrued daily.

   K TOTAL RETURN SWAPS -- The Trust may enter into swap agreements to hedge
   against fluctuations in securities prices, interest rates or market
   conditions; to change the duration of the overall portfolio; to mitigate
   default risk; or for other risk management purposes. Pursuant to these
   agreements, the Trust makes monthly payments at a rate equal to a
   predetermined spread to the one-month LIBOR. In exchange, the Trust receives
   payments based on the rate of return of a benchmark industry index. During
   the term of the outstanding swap agreement, changes in the underlying value
   of the swap are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. Payments received or
   made at the end of the measurement period are recorded as realized gains and
   losses. The value of the swap is determined by changes in the relationship
   between the rate of interest and the benchmark industry index. The Trust is
   exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the swap
   counterparty. However, the Trust does not anticipate non-performance by the
   counterparty. Risk may also arise from the unanticipated movements in value
   of interest rates or the index.

   L CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS -- The Trust may enter into credit default swap
   contracts for risk management purposes, including diversification. When the
   Trust is the buyer of a credit default swap contract, the Trust is entitled
   to receive the par (or other agreed-upon) value of a referenced debt
   obligation from the counterparty to the contract in the event of a default by
   a third party, such as a U.S. or foreign corporate issuer, on the debt
   obligation. In return, the Trust would pay the counterparty a periodic stream
   of payments over the term of the contract provided that no event of default
   has occurred. If no default occurs, the Trust would have spent the stream of
   payments and received no benefit from the contract. When the Trust is the
   seller of a credit default swap contract, it receives the stream of payments,
   but is obligated to pay upon default of the referenced debt obligation. As
   the seller, the Trust would effectively add leverage to its portfolio
   because, in addition to its total net assets, the Trust would be subject to
   investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap. The Trust will
   segregate assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal
   to the aggregate market value of the credit default swaps of which it is the
   seller, marked to market on a daily basis. These transactions involve certain
   risks, including the risk that the seller may be unable to fulfill the
   transaction.

   M USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of the financial statements in
   conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
   of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
   the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   N INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Trust's organizational documents, its
   officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and
   expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust, and
   shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for obligations of
   the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters
   into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification
   clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as
   this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have
   not yet occurred.

   O OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the
   securities are purchased or sold. Realized gains and losses are computed
   based on the specific identification of securities sold.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

   The Trust issued 3,940 shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series A,
   3,940 shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series B, 3,940 shares of
   Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series C, and 3,940 shares of Auction
   Preferred Shares (APS) Series D on January 26, 2004 in a public offering. The
   underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded as a reduction
   of the capital of the common shares. Dividends on the APS, which accrue
   daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering of the
   APS and have been reset every 28 days thereafter by an auction. Dividend
   rates ranged from 1.10% to 1.98% for Series A shares, 1.109% to 1.85% for
   Series B shares, 1.08% to 1.90% for Series C shares and 1.09% to 1.95% for
   Series D shares.

   The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, at a redemption price
   equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
   dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if the Trust

                                       25

   is in default for an extended period on its asset maintenance requirements
   with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in
   an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a
   class have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In
   general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have equal voting
   rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the APS, as a
   separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the Board of
   Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus
   accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required to maintain certain
   asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the Trust's By-Laws and
   the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Trust pays an annual fee equivalent
   to 0.25% of the preferred shares' liquidation value for the remarketing
   efforts associated with the preferred auctions.

3  DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS

   The Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   In addition, at least annually, the Trust intends to distribute net capital
   gain, if any. Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
   Distributions to preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at
   the end of each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction
   Preferred Shares is generally twenty-eight days. The applicable dividend rate
   for the Auction Preferred Shares on October 31, 2004 was 1.98%, 1.85%, 1.87%,
   and 1.93%, for Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Shares,
   respectively. For the period ended October 31, 2004, the Trust paid dividends
   to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $1,091,236, $1,090,483,
   $1,091,666 and $1,093,151 for Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D
   Shares, respectively, representing an average APS dividend rate for such
   period of 1.462%, 1.428%, 1.452%, and 1.475%, respectively.

   The Trust distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principals generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

   The tax character of distributions paid for the period from the start of
   business, November 28, 2003, to October 31, 2004 was as follows:

                                                                OCTOBER 31, 2004

   Distributions declared from:

   Ordinary income                                              $     34,358,915
</Table>

   During the period from the start of business, November 28, 2003, to October
   31, 2004, undistributed net investment income was decreased by $2,953,442,
   and accumulated net realized loss was increased by $2,953,442 primarily due
   to differences between book and tax accounting. This change had no effect on
   the net assets or the net asset value per share.

   As of October 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
   losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

<Table>
   <S>                                                          <C>

   Capital loss carryforwards                                   $     (5,860,075)

   Unrealized gain                                              $      5,724,250

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the
   average daily gross assets of the Trust, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM), as compensation for management and investment advisory services
   rendered to the Trust. For the period from the start of business, November
   28, 2003 to October 31, 2004, the fee was equivalent to 0.75% (annualized) of
   the Trust's average daily gross assets for such period and amounted to
   $6,599,223.

   In addition, the Adviser has contractually agreed to reimburse the Trust for
   fees and other expenses in the amount of 0.20% of the average daily gross
   assets of the Trust for the first five full years of the Trust's operations,
   0.15% of average weekly gross assets in year 6, 0.10% in year 7 and 0.05% in
   year 8. For the period from the start of business, November 28, 2003 to
   October 31, 2004 the Investment Adviser waived $1,754,115 of its advisory
   fee.

   Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of the above

   owned by the Trust at October 31, 2004, as computed on a federal income tax

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   The Trust may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in
   the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure
   to various market risks. These financial instruments include written options
   and financial futures contracts and may involve, to a varying degree,
   elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement
   purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent
   the investment the Trust has in particular classes of financial instruments
   and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk.
   The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful
   only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

   At October 31, 2004, the Trust had entered into Credit Default Swaps with
   Credit Suisse First Boston dated January 9, 2004 and January 27, 2004 whereby
   the Trust will receive 2.45% per year times the notional amounts of
   $5,800,000 and $5,800,000, respectively. The Trust makes payment only upon a
   default event on underlying loan assets (50 in total, each representing 2% of
   the notional value of the swap). At October 31, 2004, The Trust had
   sufficient cash segregated to cover potential obligations arising from open
   swap contracts.

9  ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)

   The Trust held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders on August 19, 2004. The
   following action was taken by the shareholders:

EATON VANCE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE TRUST as of October 31, 2004
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF EATON VANCE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE TRUST:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Eaton
Vance Senior Floating-Rate Trust (the Trust), including the portfolio of
investments as of October 31, 2004, and the related statement of operations, the
statement of changes in net assets, and the financial highlights for the period
from the start of business, November 28, 2003, to October 31, 2004. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities held as of October 31, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Eaton Vance Senior Floating-Rate Trust at October 31, 2004, the results of its
operations, the changes in its net assets, and the financial highlights for the
period from the start of business, November 28, 2003, to October 31, 2004, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

EATON VANCE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE TRUST
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust. You may elect to
participate in the Plan by completing the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Application
Form. If you do not participate, you will receive all distributions in cash paid
by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc. as dividend paying agent. On the
distribution payment date, if the net asset value per Share is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new
Shares will be issued. The number of Shares shall be determined by the greater
of the net asset value per Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares
generally will be purchased on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions
subject to income tax (if any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC, Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC, Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.

(1)    Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit of
the registrant's financial statements and are not reported under the category of
audit fees and specifically include fees for the performance of certain
agreed-upon procedures relating to the registrant's auction preferred shares.

(2)    Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services
rendered by the principal accountant relating to tax compliance, tax advice, and
tax planning and specifically include fees for tax return preparation.

(3)    All other fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for products and
services provided by the registrant's principal accountant other than audit,
audit-related, and tax services.

* The Trust commenced operations on November 28, 2003.

(e)(1) The registrant's audit committee has adopted policies and procedures
relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrant's principal
accountant (the "Pre-Approval Policies"). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a
framework intended to assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its
pre-approval responsibilities. As a general matter, the Pre-Approval Policies
(i) specify certain types of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services
determined to be pre-approved by the audit committee; and (ii) delineate
specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process,
including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.
Unless a service is specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies,
it must be separately pre-approved by the audit committee.

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services
pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by the registrant's audit
committee at least annually. The registrant's audit committee maintains full
responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of
the registrant's principal accountant.

(e)(2) No services described in paragraphs (b)-(d) above were approved by the
registrant's audit committee pursuant to the "de minimis exception" set forth in
Rule 2-01 (c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X.

(f) Not applicable.

(g) The following table presents (i) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees
for audit-related, tax, and other services) billed to the registrant by the
registrant's principal accountant for the registrant's first fiscal year; and
(ii) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees for audit-related, tax, and other
services) billed to the Eaton Vance organization by the registrant's principal
accountant for the same time period.

(1)    Eaton Vance Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp., acts as the
       registrant's investment adviser and administrator.
* The Trust commenced operations on November 28, 2003.

 (h) The registrant's audit committee has considered whether the provision by
the registrant's principal accountant of non-audit services to the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.
