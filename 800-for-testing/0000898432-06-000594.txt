CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this semi-annual report for the Neuberger Berman
Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds for the six months ended April 30, 2006.
The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Funds' investments,
and their unaudited financial statements for the reporting period.

Each Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income
exempt from regular federal income tax and, for each state-specific Fund, a high
level of current income exempt from that state's personal income taxes (and in
the case of the New York Fund, New York City personal income tax).

We invest in intermediate-term municipal bonds because our experience and
research indicate strongly that this maturity range has historically offered the
best risk/reward profile on the yield curve, providing much of the return of
longer-term bonds--with less volatility and risk.

We believe that our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined
investment process will benefit you with superior tax exempt current income over
the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,


/s/ Peter Sundman

INTERMEDIATE MUNICIPAL CLOSED-END FUNDS Portfolio Commentaries

We are pleased to report that on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis, all three
Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds delivered positive
returns and outperformed the Lehman 10-Year Municipal Bond Index in the six
months ended April 30, 2006.

Four 25-basis-point Federal Reserve rate hikes restrained fixed income returns
during the reporting period. However, intermediate maturity municipal bonds
performed considerably better than intermediate U.S. Treasury securities and
corporate bonds, with our Lehman 10-Year Municipal Bond Index benchmark and the
Lehman 7-Year GO Index returning 1.24% and 1.23% respectively compared to 0.64%
and 0.04% gains for the Lehman Brother Intermediate U.S. Treasury Index and the
Lehman Brothers U.S. Credit Index, respectively.

Why did municipals perform so well relative to Treasuries and corporates? In our
opinion, it was because the people and institutions that buy municipal
securities tend to be investors rather than traders. This is particularly true
at the longer end of the municipal securities market, which is dominated by
insurance companies that structurally need to maintain positions in longer
maturity debt.

In the first half of fiscal 2006, lower rated issues outperformed high credit
quality municipal securities. Money continues to flow into lower credit quality
issues. However, we think this is simply because these securities have been
going up in price rather than as a result of favorable fundamentals. With credit
spreads as tight as they are currently, there appears to be little reason to
move into lower quality issues at this point.

With the Federal Reserve on the monetary warpath through the first half of
fiscal 2006, the portfolios remained defensively positioned, with
below-benchmark weighted average maturities and durations. This will likely
remain the case until we gain confidence that the Fed is ready to shift into
neutral. We do not try to divine changes in Fed policy by looking for linguistic
nuances in the notes released following Federal Open Market Committee meetings,
but rather by monitoring the same economic data the Fed looks at in making its
policy decisions. Currently, with longer term market interest rates finally
moving higher, expensive gasoline and higher adjustable rate mortgage payments
likely to put pressure on consumer spending, additional evidence of softening in
the housing market, and the Fed's own recognition of the lagging effect of rate
hikes on the economy, we think the Fed is nearly done tightening. If, in the
coming months, job growth and manufacturing activity moderate and commodity
prices stabilize, we believe the Fed will call a time out.

In general, we think the municipal securities market is in good shape. The
strong economy has bolstered municipal balance sheets and improved credit
quality. Relative to Treasuries, municipal bond yields still provide an
after-tax advantage for investors in high federal and state income tax brackets.
As always, there are a few things we are keeping our eyes on. We are extremely
cautious in the Gulf Coast states, where repairing infrastructure damaged by
Hurricanes Katrina and Rita is creating fiscal difficulties. We are also
sensitive to the fiscal health of issuers with underfunded


                                       2

pension plans. Although we doubt there is the political will to overhaul the
federal income tax system, we continue to monitor debates in Washington over tax
policies that could impact the municipal securities market.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continually offered. There is
an initial public offering and once issued common shares of closed-end funds are
sold in the open market through a stock exchange.

The composition, industries and holdings of the Funds are subject to change.
Investment return will fluctuate. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results.

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investments in securities by Neuberger Berman California Intermediate
     Municipal Fund Inc. ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal
     Fund Inc. ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate
     Municipal Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund", and collectively,
     the "Funds") are valued daily by obtaining bid price quotations from
     independent pricing services on all securities available in each service's
     data base. For all other securities, bid prices are obtained from principal
     market makers in those securities or, if quotations are not readily
     available, by methods each Fund's Board of Directors has approved on the
     belief that they reflect fair value. Numerous factors may be considered
     when determining the fair value of a security, including available analyst,
     media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and whether the issuer
     of the security being fair valued has other securities outstanding.
     Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be
     valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned, approximates
     market value.

##   At April 30, 2006, selected Fund information on a U.S. federal income tax
     basis was as follows:

</Table>

@    At time of investment, municipal securities purchased by the Funds are
     within the four highest rating categories (with respect to at least 80% of
     total assets) assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating
     organization ("NRSRO") such as Moody's Investors Service, Inc., Standard &
     Poor's, or Fitch Investors Services, Inc. or, where not rated, are
     determined by the Funds' investment manager to be of comparable quality.
     Approximately 79%, 68%, and 58% of the municipal securities held by
     California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively, have credit
     enhancement features backing them, which the Funds may rely on, such as
     letters of credit, insurance, or guarantees. Without these credit
     enhancement features the securities may or may not meet the quality
     standards of the Funds. Pre-refunded bonds are supported by securities in
     escrow issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government, its agencies, or
     instrumentalities. The amount escrowed is sufficient to pay the periodic
     interest due and the principal of these bonds. Putable bonds give the Funds
     the right to sell back the issue on the date specified.

('b') Security is guaranteed by the corporate or non-profit obligor.

(n)  Restricted security subject to restrictions on resale under federal
     securities laws. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A
     and have been deemed by the investment manager to be liquid. At April 30,
     2006, these securities amounted to $4,482,000 or 1.5% of net assets
     applicable to common shareholders for Intermediate.

^^   Not rated by a NRSRO.

(O)  All or a portion of this security was purchased on a when-issued basis. At
     April 30, 2006, these securities amounted to $500,000 or .63% of net assets
     for New York.

(00) All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for
     when-issued purchase commitments.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman California Intermediate Municipal Fund
     Inc. ("California"), Neuberger Berman Intermediate Municipal Fund
     Inc. ("Intermediate"), and Neuberger Berman New York Intermediate Municipal
     Fund Inc. ("New York") (individually a "Fund" and, collectively, the
     "Funds") were organized as Maryland corporations on July 29,2002.
     California and New York are registered as non-diversified, closed-end
     management investment companies and Intermediate is registered as a
     diversified, closed-end management investment company under the Investment
     Company Act of 1940, as amended. Each Fund's Board of Directors may
     classify or re-classify any unissued shares of capital stock into one or
     more classes of preferred stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The assets of each Fund belong only to that Fund, and the liabilities of
     each Fund are borne solely by that Fund and no other.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management
     Inc. ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Funds' Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on a trade date basis. Interest income, including accretion of
     discount (adjusted for original issue discount, where applicable) and
     amortization of premium, where applicable, is recorded on the accrual
     basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions are recorded
     on the basis of identified cost and stated in the Statements of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: Each Fund is treated as a separate entity for U.S.
     federal income tax purposes. It is the policy of each Fund to continue to
     qualify as a regulated investment company by complying with the
     requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to
     regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its
     earnings to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax
     provision is required.

     Income distributions and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
     due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment
     securities held by each Fund, timing differences and differing
     characterization of distributions made by each Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2005, there were no permanent differences
     resulting from different book and tax accounting reclassified at year end.


                                       30

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October 31,
     2005 and October 31, 2004 was as follows:

     As of October 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings
     (accumulated losses) on a U.S federal income tax basis were as follows:

</Table>

     The difference between book basis and tax basis distributable earnings is
     attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments.

     To the extent each Fund's net realized capital gains, if any, can be offset
     by capital loss carryforwards, it is the policy of each Fund not to
     distribute such gains. As determined at October 31, 2005, the Funds had
     unused capital loss carryforwards available for federal income tax purposes
     to offset net realized capital gains, if any, as follows:

</Table>

5    DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Each Fund earns income, net of expenses,
     daily on its investments. It is the policy of each Fund to declare and pay
     distributions to common shareholders on a monthly basis. Distributions from
     net realized capital gains, if any, are normally distributed in December.
     Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date.
     Distributions to preferred shareholders are accrued and determined as
     described in Note A-7.

     Subsequent to April 30, 2006, each Fund declared two monthly distributions
     to common shareholders payable June 15, 2006 and July 17, 2006, to

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged to that Fund. Expenses
     borne by the complex of related investment companies, which includes
     open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management serves as
     investment manager, that are not directly attributed to a Fund are
     allocated among the Funds and the other investment companies in the complex
     or series thereof on the basis of relative net assets, except where a more
     appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On October 21, 2002, the Funds re-classified
     unissued shares of capital stock into several series of Auction Market
     Preferred Shares ("AMPS"),as follows:

<Table>

     NEW YORK            1,500             1,500
</Table>

     On December 13, 2002, the Funds issued several series of AMPS, as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
                    SERIES A SHARES   SERIES B SHARES
     <S>                 <C>               <C>

     NEW YORK              965               965
</Table>

     All shares of each series of AMPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000
     per share plus any accumulated unpaid distributions, whether or not earned
     or declared by the Fund, but excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation
     Value"). Distributions to AMPS shareholders, which are cumulative, are
     accrued daily. It is the policy of each Fund to pay distributions every 7
     days for each Fund's AMPS Series A and every 28 days for each Fund's AMPS
     Series B, unless in a special rate period.

     In the absence of a special rate period, distribution rates are reset every
     7 days for each Fund's AMPS Series A, based on the results of an auction.
     For the six months ended April 30, 2006, distribution rates ranged from:

                    DISTRIBUTION RATE

<Table>
     <S>              <C>
     CALIFORNIA       2.55% - 3.50%

     NEW YORK         2.45% - 3.60%
</Table>

     In the absence of a special rate period, distribution rates are reset every
     28 days for each Fund's AMPS Series B, based on the results of an auction.
     For the six months ended April 30, 2006, distribution rates ranged from:

                    DISTRIBUTION RATE

</Table>

                                       32

<Page>

     The Funds declared distributions to AMPS shareholders for the period May 1,
     2006 to May 31, 2006, for each series of the AMPS as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
                    SERIES A   SERIES B
                     SHARES     SHARES

     NEW YORK         67,533     73,546
</Table>

     The Funds may redeem shares of each series of AMPS, in whole or in part, on
     the second business day preceding any distribution payment date at
     Liquidation Value.

     The Funds are also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS.
     Failure to comply with these restrictions could preclude the Funds from
     declaring any distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common
     shares and/or could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation
     Value.

     The holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
     holders of common stock as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
     separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or the Funds'
     charter. The holders of a Fund's AMPS, voting as a separate class, are
     entitled at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a
     majority of the Directors of a Fund if the Fund failed to pay distributions
     on AMPS for two consecutive years.

8    CONCENTRATION OF RISK: The ability of the issuers of the debt securities
     held by the Funds to meet their obligations may be affected by economic
     developments, including those particular to a specific industry or region.
     The investment policies of California and New York involve investing
     substantially all of their assets in municipal bonds of issuers located in
     the state of California and the state of New York, respectively. This
     policy makes those Funds more susceptible to adverse economic, political,
     regulatory or other factors affecting the issuers of such municipal bonds
     than a fund that does not limit its investments to such issuers.

9    INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Funds' organizational
     documents provide that their officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Funds. In addition, both in some of their principal service contracts and
     in the normal course of their business, the Funds enter into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. Each Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against each Fund.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     Each Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, each Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.


                                       33

<Page>

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from each Fund at the following annual
     rates:

<Table>
<Caption>
      YEAR ENDED       % OF AVERAGE
     OCTOBER 31,   DAILY MANAGED ASSETS
     <S>                   <C>
     2006 - 2007           0.25
         2008              0.20
         2009              0.15
         2010              0.10
         2011              0.05
</Table>

     Management has not agreed to waive any portion of its fees beyond October
     31, 2011.

     For the six months ended April 30, 2006, such waived fees amounted to
     $197,499,$600,525, and $159,891 for California, Intermediate, and New York,
     respectively.

     Each Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement. Each Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.30% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
     ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
     Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
     under the agreement.

     Management and Neuberger Berman,  LLC  ("Neuberger"),  a member firm of the
     New York Stock  Exchange and  sub-adviser  to each Fund,  are  wholly-owned
     subsidiaries of Lehman  Brothers  Holdings Inc., a  publicly-owned  holding
     company.  Neuberger is retained by Management to furnish it with investment
     recommendations  and research  information without added cost to each Fund.
     Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors of each Fund are also
     employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

     Each Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its
     custodian contract. For the six months ended April 30, 2006, the impact of
     this arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $642, $954, and $1,182 for
     California, Intermediate, and New York, respectively.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, each Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by each Fund and the broker-dealer.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, each Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that each
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a
     minimum level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to
     maintain the AAA/Aaa rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the
     fact that the rating agencies require each Fund, in performing this
     calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face value, at
     rates determined by the rating agencies. Each Fund pays a fee to State
     Street for the preparation of this report which is reflected in the
     Statements of Operations under the caption "Basic maintenance expense."

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Intermediate Municipal Closed-End Funds

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of each Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under each Fund's distribution reinvestment plan. Results repre-
     sent past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns
     may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment returns
     may fluctuate and shares when sold may be worth more or less than original
     cost. For each Fund, total return would have been lower if Management had
     not waived the investment management fee.

#    The Fund is required to calculate an expense ratio without taking into
     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.

++   After waiver of investment management fee by Management. Had Management not
     undertaken such action, the annualized ratios of net expenses to average
     daily net assets applicable to common shareholders would have been:

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the
Distribution Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current
Shares are registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as
of the first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the payment date, to apply the
amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares (less their
PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend or distribution except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day
during the purchase period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than
the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent
will not make any further open-market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of such dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases
during the purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to
the uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue
new Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the
purchase period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net
asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus
estimated brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the
terms specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the reinvestment purchase comparison under the Plan, (a)
the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last sales
price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are principally
traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or if not so
listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean between the
closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on such date
and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be the net
asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund. All
dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or Shares)
shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
Participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or
income dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their
PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF NEUBERGER BERMAN FUNDS

I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

This code of ethics ("Code") for the registered investment companies within the
Neuberger Berman Fund complex (each, a "Company") applies to each Company's
Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal
Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is listed in Exhibit
A). The purpose of the Code is to promote:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that a Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Company;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to  an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL, POTENTIAL AND APPARENT
     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual,
potential and apparent conflicts of interest.

     An "actual conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a
result of his or her position with the Company.

     A "potential conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest is such that it might, under certain circumstances, interfere with the
interests of the Company or the Officer's service to the Company, but those
circumstances do not now exist.


<PAGE>

     Appearances may create an "apparent conflict of interest" even when an
actual conflict does not exist. For example, an apparent conflict may exist if a
Covered Officer owns a thinly traded security that a series of a Company (a
"Fund") is buying, even if there is no actual conflict of interest.

     Certain actual or potential conflicts of interest may arise out of the
relationships between Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject
to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940
("Investment Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Company. The compliance programs and procedures of Neuberger Berman Management
Inc., Neuberger Berman, LLC (collectively referred to as the "investment
adviser") and each Company are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside
of the parameters of this Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, actual or potential conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the
contractual relationship between the Company and the investment adviser of which
the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the Company or for the investment adviser, or for both),
be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
different effects on the adviser and the Company. The participation of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship
between the Company and the investment adviser and is consistent with the
performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Company.
Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Companies' Boards of
Trustees/Directors ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal interest
of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Company. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the
Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these examples are not
exhaustive.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o   use his or her personal influence or personal relationships  improperly
         to  influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting  by  the

                                        2
<PAGE>

         Company,  as for  example  where  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
         personally to the detriment of the Company;

     o   cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit the Company;

     o   retaliate against any other Covered Officer, or any employee of a
         Company, its service providers, or the affiliated persons of any of
         them, for good faith reports of potential violations of this Code.

     There are some actual or potential conflict of interest situations that
should always be approved by the Company's Chief Legal Officer1 if material.
Covered Officers are encouraged to discuss with the Chief Legal Officer any
potential conflict the materiality of which is uncertain. Examples of reportable
conflicts include:

     o   service as a director on the board of any public or private company,
         other than the Companies, their investment adviser, and its affiliates;

     o   the  receipt of any non-nominal  gifts,  i.e., those in excess of $100;

     o   the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the
         Company has current or prospective business dealings unless such
         entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
         to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
         impropriety;

     o   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
         with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment
         adviser or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
         charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio
         transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
         arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
         equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o   Each Covered Officer must familiarize himself or herself with the
         disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company and the
         Company's Disclosure Controls and Procedures;

     o   each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
         to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or
         outside the Company, including to the Company's trustees/directors and
         auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
         organizations;

- ----------------
1    The Board of each  Company has  appointed Maxine L. Gerson as  Chief Legal
     Officer.

                                        3
<PAGE>

     o   each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
         her area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
         of the Companies and the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
         accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
         documents the Companies file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
         public communications made by the Companies; and

     o   each Covered Officer should promote compliance with the standards and
         restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.  Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he or she has
         received, read, and understands the Code;

     o   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied
         with the requirements of the Code;

     o   report on the Company's Questionnaire for Trustees/Directors and
         Officers, where responsive to appropriate questions, all categories of
         affiliations or other relationships giving rise to actual or potential
         conflicts of interest; and

     o   notify the Chief Legal Officer promptly if he or she is aware of facts
         and circumstances that he or she knows are a violation of this Code.
         Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The Chief Legal Officer is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation.2 However, any approvals or
waivers3 sought by the Principal Executive Officer will be considered by the
Independent Trustees/ Directors of the affected Company (the "Committee").

- ----------------
2    The Chief Legal Officer is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with
     counsel to the Company and counsel to the Independent Trustees/Directors,
     and is encouraged to do so.
3    Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
     waiver" as "the registrant's failure to take action within a reasonable
     period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the code
     of ethics that has been made known to an executive officer" of the
     registrant. Both waivers and implicit waivers must be disclosed publicly.


                                        4
<PAGE>

     The Companies will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any potential violations reported to him or her.

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will report to the Committee the outcome of the
         investigation, including the facts of the initial report, the scope and
         outcome of the investigation, and whether or not the Chief Legal
         Officer believes that a violation occurred.

     o   The person who initially reported the matter will be informed that the
         matter has been investigated and reported to the Committee.

     o   If the Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will inform
         and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider appropriate
         action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
         applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate
         personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation
         to dismiss the Covered Officer.

     o The Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate.

     o   Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Companies for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Companies, the investment adviser, the Companies'
principal underwriter, or other service providers purport to apply a lesser
standard to the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Companies' and the investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act and the investment
adviser's more detailed policies and procedures set forth in Neuberger Berman
Management Inc.'s Compliance Manual are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not preempted by this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of
Independent Trustees/Directors.

                                        5
<PAGE>

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Company, its Board (and any
Committee of the Board) and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Companies and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
