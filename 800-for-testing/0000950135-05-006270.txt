    CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders:

We are pleased to present the Annual Report of The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005.


On August 31, 2005, the Fund's net asset value ("NAV") per share was US$14.76.
The Fund's NAV increased by 15.8% in U.S. dollar terms and increased by 11.1% in
New Taiwan ("NT") dollar terms for the fiscal year. During the same period, the
Taiwan Stock Exchange Index (the "TAIEX") increased by 8.8% in U.S. dollar terms
and increased by 4.6% in NT dollar terms. The U.S. dollar appreciated by 3.8%
against the NT dollar during this period. The Fund outperformed the TAIEX by
6.4% in U.S. dollar terms during the fiscal year.



At the Board Meeting held on 18 July, I was honored to be elected the Chairman
of the Board. On behalf of the Board, I thank my predecessor, S. Y. Wang, for
his leadership in the past years. We continue to benefit from his advice, as he

    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE


The Fund's net asset value ("NAV") increased by 15.8% in U.S. dollar terms and
increased by 11.1% in New Taiwan ("NT") dollar terms for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2005. During the same period, the Taiwan Stock Exchange Index (the
"TAIEX") increased by 8.8% in U.S. dollar terms and increased by 4.6% in NT
dollar terms. The Fund outperformed the TAIEX by 7.0% in U.S. dollar terms
during the year.



Based on the performance-attribution report generated by FactSet (an investment
research service), the Fund's positive performance relative to the TAIEX for the
2005 fiscal year was attributed to both sector allocation and stock selection.
The portfolio benefited from our overweight positions in the integrated circuit
("IC") design and handset sectors and overweight positions in such stocks as
Honhai Precision and Mediatek.



ECONOMIC OUTLOOK



The global economy is expected to grow by 3.5% in 2005, slowing from 4.1% growth
recorded in 2004. The United States, China and Japan have raised their 2005 GDP
growth targets in the past months. We expect monetary and liquidity conditions
to support continued growth of the global economy in the coming quarters. As the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") leading
indicators have been trending downward since 2004, we expect them to bottom out
and then begin to improve in the coming months.



Despite damage caused by Hurricane Katrina, the U.S. economy appears to be
fundamentally solid. We believe that an increase in capital spending plans by
U.S. corporations and improvement in business confidence will further support
U.S. economic growth in 2005, albeit at a decreasing pace. Hurricane Katrina
could potentially have some slightly negative impact on the U.S. economy in the
third quarter of 2005, but the damages could be only a short-term effect. If we
consider the stimulus from the rebuilding of the damaged area, the overall GDP
impact could be neutral for 2005 and 2006 GDP growth may not be affected. The
U.S. government's move to release some of its oil reserves to help ease the
supply situation may signal that the U.S. government is "drawing the line" on
oil prices at current levels. This may ease concerns about a further oil price
hike, which would likely impede economic growth. U.S. real GDP growth is
forecast to be 3.6% in 2005 and 3.4% in 2006, and such growth would likely be
driven by both domestic demand and exports.

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Despite the expected slowdown of the global economy, the United States and
Chinese will likely remain the principal engines of global growth. Healthy
growth rates are also expected in other Asian emerging markets. The China
economy is expected to grow moderately by 9.0% in 2005 and 8.5% in 2006, mainly
driven by strong domestic demand and exports against the backdrop of ongoing
efforts by the Chinese government to prevent the economy from expanding too
quickly. As inflation uncertainty has resurfaced with recent higher oil prices,
future interest-rate increases are unpredictable and may hamper the pace of the
global economic recovery. Nevertheless, we believe that the global economy has
enough strength to continue expanding at approximately 3.5% in 2005 and
approximately 3.2% in 2006.



Taiwan's economic growth appears to have bottomed out in the first quarter of
2005 and a recovery appears on track. Economic data showed that Taiwan is
undergoing a mild recovery. We expect a modest recovery in export growth coupled
with a steady increase in consumption and resilient investment to support
economic expansion at 4.1% in the second half of 2005. Trade growth is expected
to increase mildly in the second half of 2005 and we expect exports to return to
a modest upward trend with the global technology recovery. Export growth is
expected to be 7.9%, and import growth is expected to be 9.9% in 2005. Taiwan's
consumer price index is expected to increase by 2.0% in 2005, mainly due to
increasing oil prices and weather-induced spikes in fresh food prices.



For 2006, we anticipate that Taiwan's economic fundamentals will remain
resilient, supporting expansion of both domestic and external demand. The
Central Bank is likely to continue to raise rates gradually into the first half
of 2006, amid an expected modest economic recovery and rising inflationary
pressure. The spillover effect of persistently high oil prices will probably
become more evident in the fourth quarter of 2005 and weigh on both business and
consumers through early 2006. Investment by Taiwanese companies could slow, but
the outlook remains favorable due to economic links between China and Taiwan,
strong domestic demand and exports as well as the healthy outlook for the U.S.
and Chinese economies. We anticipate Taiwan's GDP to grow 4.0% in 2006. However,
if the U.S. economy slows down unexpectedly or if China imposes additional
macro-economic cooling measures, then this would have an adverse impact on
Taiwan. Another uncertainty that could unsettle the market would be a renewed
surge in oil prices.


                                                                               5
<PAGE>


    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER (continued)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Despite high oil prices, the global economy is expected to continue to grow
moderately in the coming year, and we believe Taiwan will remain a favorable
market for long-term investment. After some slowing in the current year,
corporate earnings growth is expected to return to positive territory in 2006.
Taiwan companies' competitive strengths -- which include their quality
engineers, close relations with their customers and lower-cost production
facilities in China -- will underpin the positive longer-term outlook for the
stock market.



MARKET OUTLOOK AND INVESTMENT STRATEGY


Despite concern over higher oil prices and monetary tightening in the past year,
Taiwan equities performed well and continued to gain ground. The TAIEX rose by
4.6% (in NT dollar terms). This rise was helped by a strong demand for
industrial cyclical products in 2004/early 2005, as strong demand for technology
products continued in the past year. The TAIEX rise was also partially
attributable to foreign inflows after the second phase of Morgan Stanley Capital
International's ("MSCI") re-weighting of the MSCI Emerging Market Index at the
end of May 2005. MSCI increased the LIF (Limited Investability Factor) from 75%
to 100% in the second phase re-weighting, with Taiwan becoming the country with
the largest weighting (more than 20% in May 2005) within the MSCI Emerging
Market Index. The MSCI re-weighting fueled investors' buying interest, and that
in turn benefited Taiwan's large market capitalization stocks. The technology
sector enjoyed the highest return and received the majority of both foreign and
domestic buying interest. Foreigners bought approximately US$19 billion of
Taiwan shares in the past year due to the MSCI re-weighting and the recovery in
the technology sector. Foreigners currently own approximately 28% of the Taiwan
stock market.


Politics are expected to have minimal impact on the stock market in the
near-term future. County and local mayoral elections in December 2005 are
expected to have little impact on the stock market, and Taiwan politics will
likely remain gridlocked until March 2008 when a Presidential election is
scheduled.



The valuation of Taiwan's stock market appears to be attractive. The dividend
yield is 4%. The market forward PER (price to earnings ratio) is 12.8 times and
the market PBR (price to book ratio) is 1.7 times. Taiwan securities are trading
at lower valuations than most Asian market securities, and Taiwan's stock market
has a moderate upside potential in the next two quarters.

<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In line with moderate global economic growth in 2006 and continuing recovery of
technology demand, we expect 14% year-on-year corporate earnings growth in 2006
for our stock universe, against a 5% decline in 2005.



High oil prices have weighed on our outlook in 2006. The Taiwan government has
tried to limit increases in domestic energy prices, so the rises in world oil
prices have so far had a moderate impact on growth and inflation. High oil
prices could exert an indirect effect by weakening global economic growth, with
that weakness hitting overseas demand for Taiwanese products. Sectors most
adversely impacted include shipping, airlines, plastics and petrochemicals.
Slowdown in U.S. consumer demand may trim demand for Taiwanese electronic goods,
car parts and container shipping capacity. The slowdown in growth of Taiwan's
two major export markets (the United States and China) indicates that Taiwan's
2006 export growth would only be moderate, as U.S. economic expansion will
likely start to decelerate moderately into 2006, and the growth of China's
economy is likely to be moderate.



After seeing 2.1% appreciation in 2005 in the Reminbi ("RMB"), China's currency,
global investors are anticipating further appreciation. The inflow of hot money
into Taiwan is expected as a play on China and further appreciation in the RMB.
This expected inflow would be positive for the liquidity of the Taiwan market
and will drive the domestic reflation theme further. The NT dollar is likely to
appreciate by a lesser percentage than the RMB due to weakness in exports and
lower-than-expected GDP growth in the first half of 2005. RMB appreciation is
negative for downstream electronics industries with production facilities in
China, which would have to export at a higher price. However, it is positive for
traditional industries such as auto, cement, rubber and construction materials
due to stronger domestic demand driven by a stronger local currency.



We expect technology to remain the main growth sector in the coming year.
Hardware company valuations are still reasonable at 12.5 times anticipated 2006
earnings. We are positive on new product launches, which include Microsoft's
Longhorn, 3G handsets and next-generation game consoles. We expect 2006 will be
a healthy year for the semiconductor industry due to recovery of global
semiconductor capital expenditures from restraint in 2005, a reasonable 2006
global economic outlook and new product launches driving PC demand. The market
may continue its rebound for a few months due to seasonal strong


                                                                               7
<PAGE>


    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER (continued)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

demand for technology products, easing of high oil prices and improvement in
cross-strait relations.

In the short term, PC seasonal demand exists ahead of the year-end. Strong
growth and seasonal demand should combine to drive outperformance of PC related
shares in the fourth quarter of 2005. Our strategy is to increase our exposure
in high-beta stocks, which should offer reasonable returns if cautiously
invested. In addition, there is more good news from the technology sector-rising
utilization rates in most semiconductor companies; strong demand for notebook
PCs, handsets and LCD panels; as well as the coming peak season of consumer
electronics products. Most technology companies continue to deliver
stronger-than-expected sales and are issuing positive outlooks for the coming
two quarters. Therefore, we expect that share prices of technology companies
should continue outperforming in the coming months. We plan to increase our
exposure to semiconductor, handset and consumer electronics-related shares. Our
main focus will be technology stocks with good value and expected stable
earnings growth in 2006.

We will remain underweight in the material sectors, such as steel,
petrochemical, paper and textile, in the coming quarters. Weakening of demand
for materials from China as it strengthens its austerity measures to cool down
its economy and the demand/supply imbalance (resulting from increase in capacity
of commodity sectors in the past two years) may pose a threat to corporate
earnings growth in the commodity sector in the coming quarters.


We will continue to be underweight in the financial sector. Financial sector
earnings growth is expected to slow, as consumer lending may fall moderately in
2006 in the face of rising interest rates and relatively high oil prices.
Financial stocks are good proxy for domestic consumption and asset reflation
themes; but slow consolidation progress, flattening of the yield curve and
lackluster loan growth (7% in 2005 vs. 10% in 2004) could result in the
financial sector underperforming in the coming year.



Despite our positive long-term outlook on the Taiwan market, we expect that the
market will range trade in 2006 as gains in the technology sector might be
offset by declines in other sectors. We will use a bottom-up approach with a
focus on stock picking in 2006. Against a backdrop of softening commodity
prices, improving cross-strait relations and possible further RMB appreciation,
we have identified four themes


 8
<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for picking stocks in 2006 -- secular growth stocks, new product development,
cash dividend yield and China concept shares.


SECULAR GROWTH STOCKS



We will identify growth stocks in the technology sector. We expect technology
sector earnings to rise by more than 18% in 2006 after declining approximately
15% in 2005. Technology stock valuations still appear to be reasonable.
Technology stock earnings appeared to bottom in the second quarter of 2005 and
could be on a recovery path through the second half of 2006. IC Insights
projects that global semiconductor capital expenditures will fall 6% and is
forecasted to be 24% of sales in 2005. A drop in capital expenditures during
2005 and 2006 would lead to a stronger rebound in the semiconductor industry in
2006 and 2007. In addition to global economic growth and capacity growth,
inventory adjustment also drives the technology stock cycle and earnings.
Inventories in the U.S. electronics supply chain are reasonably lean. With
inventories down to a healthier level, profit margins should begin to improve,
which is a catalyst of share price movement.



NEW PRODUCTS IN 2006


The new-product theme will drive demand in the following sectors: (1) 3G handset
(third generation mobile phone technology service), (2) cell phones priced at
less than US$50, (3) digital home (wireless/broadband), (4) game console
upgrades and (5) PCs with Longhorn CPUs. For handsets, integrating
high-resolution cameras, bluetooth, wireless LAN and VOIP to handset chipset
solutions would help to sustain growth momentum in 2006. Demand for high-end
0.13, 0.11 and 0.09 micron technology products could drive growth momentum for
semiconductor companies. If the Notebook PC upgrade cycle continues over the
next four to six quarters, market share gain could accelerate its growth
momentum. Notebooks will be 36% of PC sales by the end of 2005 and will
eventually account for 50% of PC sales. We believe that the rising demand for
transistor-liquid crystal display ("TFT-LCD") TVs will serve as the key catalyst
for the sector and more affordable prices will continue to stimulate demand in
2006 and beyond. It is projected that a compound annual growth rate for the
TFT-LCD TV segment will be 41% in the next three years. In the longer-term, the
TFT-LCD industry is expected to double its growth to reach US$42 billion in
2007.

                                                                               9
<PAGE>


    REPORT OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER (continued)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


HIGH CASH YIELD



The 4% dividend yield of the Taiwan securities market is relatively high among
Asian securities markets. Many stocks, including telecommunications, auto and
certain technology stocks, could provide high dividend yield. Since we expect
the market to range trade in 2006, we anticipate increasing investments in
stocks able to deliver stable earnings and good yield. Taiwan securities' high
dividend yield, which exceeds the 10-year bond yield of 1.8%, should provide
good downside support.



CHINA CONCEPT SHARES


If Taiwan opens up to tourists from China, we expect domestic demand to
increase. Following the meetings between Taiwan's opposition party leaders, Lien
Chan and James Soong with China's president Hu Jintao, cross-strait relations
appear to be heading in a favorable direction, although the exact timing of any
major breakthrough is difficult to predict. The improvement of the geopolitical
climate is enhancing the environment for industries such as tourism, retail,
property, financials and transportation. Other potential beneficiaries of this
investment theme in 2006 would be companies with exposure to China's domestic
demand such as the retail, auto and cement industries.


To conclude, we expect investors to receive reasonable rewards from certain
sectors' positive results. In the year ahead, we intend to maintain exposure in
high-beta stocks to take advantage of these diverse themes and achieve better
investment returns. We will continue to strive to achieve superior performance
through a process of bottom-up stock selection. We are confident that the
Taiwanese stock market and healthy economic conditions will provide significant
investment opportunities for investors in the foreseeable future.


Thank you for your support and we look forward to presenting our strategy again
in coming reports.

Sincerely,

/s/ Victor Shih

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), a Delaware corporation, is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a diversified
closed-end management investment company.

The Fund is not permitted to invest directly in the securities of Republic of
China ("ROC") companies. Therefore, it invests through a contractual securities
investment trust fund arrangement. This arrangement was established by means of
the Securities Investment Trust, Investment Management and Custodian Contract
("Management Contract") among HSBC Investments (Taiwan) Limited ("Adviser"), the
International Commercial Bank of China (Custodian) and the Fund. Under the
Management Contract the Adviser manages and invests the assets of the Fund and
the Custodian holds the assets. The Fund is the sole beneficiary of the assets
held under the Management Contract and, as required by ROC regulations, its
interest in the assets is evidenced by units of beneficial interest.

The Fund concentrates its investments in the securities listed on the Taiwan
Stock Exchange. Because of this concentration, the Fund may be subject to
additional risks resulting from future political or economic conditions in
Taiwan and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws of currency
exchange restrictions affecting Taiwan.

The policies described below are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.


Security Valuation.  All securities, including those traded over-the-counter,
for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last sales
price prior to the time of determination of the Fund's net asset value per share
or, if there were no sales on such date, at the closing price quoted for such
securities (but if bid and asked quotations are available, at the mean between
the last current bid and asked prices, rather than such quoted closing price).
In certain instances where the price determined above may not represent fair
market value, the value is determined in such manner as the Board of Directors
may prescribe. Foreign securities may be valued at fair value according to
procedures approved by the Board of Directors if the closing price is not
reflective of current market values due to trading or events occurring in the
foreign markets between the close of the established exchange and the valuation
time of the Fund. In addition, substantial changes in values in the U.S. markets
subsequent to the close of a foreign market may also affect the values of
securities traded in the foreign market. The value of foreign securities may be
adjusted if such movements in the U.S. market exceed a specified threshold.
Short-term investments, having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value, with accrued interest or
discount earned included in interest receivable.


Repurchase Agreements.  In connection with transactions in repurchase
agreements, it is the Fund's policy that its custodian take possession of the
underlying collateral securities, the fair value of which exceeds the principal
amount of the repurchase transaction, including accrued interest, at all times.
If the seller defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines,
realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.

Foreign Currency Translation.  The financial accounting records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Investment securities, other assets and liabilities
denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the
current exchange rate. Purchases and sales of securities, income receipts and
expense payments are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the
dates of the transactions.

Reported net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions
represent net gains and losses from disposition of foreign currencies, currency
gains and losses realized between the trade dates and settlement dates of
security transactions, and the difference between the amount of net investment
income accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually received. The effects of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in securities are not
segregated in the Statement of Operations from the effects of changes in market
prices of those securities, but are

                                                                              19

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued

included in realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments in securities.

Forward Foreign Currency Transactions.  A forward foreign currency contract
("Forward") is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell currency at a set
price on a future date. The Fund may enter into Forwards in order to hedge
foreign currency risk or for other risk management purposes. Realized gains or
losses on Forwards include net gains or losses on contracts that have matured or
which the Fund has terminated by entering into an offsetting closing
transaction. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation of Forwards is included in
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and is carried on a net basis. The
portfolio could be exposed to risk of loss if the counterparty is unable to meet
the terms of the contract or if the value of the currency changes unfavorably.
As of August 31, 2005 the Fund had no open Forwards.


Indemnification Obligations.  Under the Trust's organizational documents, its
Officers and Directors are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out
of the performance of their duties to the Trust. In addition, in the normal
course of business the Trust enters into contracts that provide general
indemnifications to other parties. The Trust's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Trust that have not yet occurred.


Taxes.  As a qualified regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code, the Fund is not subject to income taxes to the extent
that it distributes all of its investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gains for its fiscal year. In addition to federal income tax
for which the Fund is liable on undistributed amounts, the Fund is subject to
federal excise tax on undistributed investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gains. The Schedule of Investments includes information
regarding income taxes under the caption "Income Tax Information." The Fund is
organized in Delaware and as such is required to pay Delaware an annual
franchise tax. Also, the Fund is currently subject to a Taiwan security
transaction tax of 0.3% on equities and 0.1% on mutual fund shares of the
transaction amount.

The Fund's functional currency for tax reporting purposes is the New Taiwan
dollar.

Investment Income.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except
where the ex-dividend date may have passed; certain dividends from foreign
securities are recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date.

Taiwanese companies typically declare dividends in the Fund's third fiscal
quarter of each year. As a result, the Fund receives substantially less dividend
income in the first half of its year. Interest income, which includes accretion
of original discount, is accrued as earned.

Dividend and interest income generated in Taiwan is subject to a 20% withholding
tax. Stock dividends received (except those which have resulted from
capitalization of capital surplus) are taxable at 20% of the par value of the
stock dividends received.

Distributions to Shareholders.  The distributable income from the assets held
under the Management Contract, which is limited to cash dividends and interest
income received, may be distributed to the Fund only once in each year at the
Fund's discretion and is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Realized capital
gains and stock dividends may also be distributed to the Fund. Within the above
limitations the Fund will, under current ROC regulations, be able to remit out
of the ROC the proceeds of income and capital gains distributions, unit
redemptions and other distributions of assets held under the Management
Contract.

The Fund distributes to shareholders at least annually, substantially all of its
taxable ordinary income and expects to distribute its taxable net realized
gains. Certain foreign currency gains (losses) are taxable as ordinary income
and, therefore, increase (decrease) taxable ordinary income available for
distribution. Pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the
"Plan"), shareholders may elect to have all distributions automatically
reinvested in Fund shares. (See the summary of the Plan.) Shareholders who do
not participate in the Plan will receive all distributions in cash paid by check
in U.S. dollars. Income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued


These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for foreign currency
transactions, losses deferred due to wash sales and excise tax regulations.
Permanent book and tax basis differences relating to shareholder distributions
will result in reclassifications to paid in capital. Reclassifications recorded
at August 31, 2005 were ($1,292,731) from undistributed Net Investment Income,
($6,636,962) from Accumulated Gain (Loss) and $7,929,693 to Paid in Capital.


Security Transactions.  Security transactions are accounted for as of the trade
date. Gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of
identified cost.

Use of Estimates.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

2. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2005, purchases and sales
of securities, other than short-term securities, aggregated $177,081,201 and
$179,205,235, respectively.

3. FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Management Fee.  As the Fund's investment adviser, HSBC Investments (Taiwan)
Limited receives a fee that is computed daily at an annual rate of 1.30% of the
Fund's average net assets. The basic fee is subject to a performance adjustment
(up to a maximum of 0.30%) based on the Fund's investment performance as
compared to the Taiwan Stock Exchange Index over a rolling 36-month period.

For the year ended August 31, 2005, the management fee, including the
performance adjustments, was equivalent to an annual rate of 1.03% of average
net assets, excluding the following one-time charge. During the period, the
basic fee included a one-time charge of approximately $535,000 as a further
revision to performance fee adjustments for the fiscal years prior to 2000. The
management fee including this charge is equivalent to an annual rate of 1.26% of
average net assets.


Directors Fees.  No director, officer or employee of the Adviser or its'
affiliates will receive any compensation from the Fund for serving as an officer
or director of the Fund. The Fund pays each of its directors who is not a
director, officer or employee of the Adviser an annual fee of $15,000 plus
$2,000 for each Board of Directors' meeting or Audit Committee meeting attended,
and $2,000 for each meeting attended by telephone. On April 18, 2005, the Board
of Directors approved increasing the fee from $1,000 to $2,000 for each meeting
attended by telephone. On July 18, 2005, the Board of Directors approved an
increase in the annual fee from $10,000 to $15,000 effective September 1, 2005.
In addition, the Fund will reimburse each of the directors for travel and
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with Board of Directors' meetings.



Administration Fees.  State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street")
provides, or arranges for the provision of certain administrative and accounting
services for the Fund, including maintaining the books and records of the Fund,
and preparing certain reports and other documents required by federal and/or
state laws and regulations. The Fund pays State Street a fee at the annual rate
of 0.11% of the Fund's average daily net assets up to $150 million, 0.08% of the
next $150 million, and 0.05% of those assets in excess of $300 million, subject
to certain minimum requirements. Effective May 1, 2005, the Fund also pays State
Street $130,000 per year for certain legal administration services, including
corporate secretarial services and preparing regulatory filings.


4. FUND SHARES

At August 31, 2005, there were 20,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value capital
stock authorized, of which 16,365,572 were issued and outstanding.

5. DISTRIBUTIONS

The Fund made a distribution of $498,168 from ordinary income during the year
ended August 31, 2005. As of August 31, 2005, the components of distributable
earnings on a tax basis were

                                                                              21
<PAGE>


    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

5. DISTRIBUTIONS - continued


$856,258 of Undistributed Ordinary Income, $0 of Undistributed Long-Term Capital
Gain, $49,438,279 of Unrealized Appreciation, ($61,467,359) of accumulated
capital losses, and ($49,616) of other temporary adjustments.


The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation and
depreciation is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash
sales.

6. PRIOR PERIODS RESTATEMENT

On August 31, 2004, the Fund restated its statement of changes in net assets for
the year ended August 31, 2003 and its financial highlights for the years ended
August 31, 2000 through 2003 to reflect correction of errors in the calculation
of management fee performance adjustments recorded by the Fund during these
years and prior. The incorrect performance adjustments were calculated based on
average net assets of the Fund over a period different than the period over
which average net assets of the Fund should have been calculated as stipulated
in the management contract and resulted in overpayments being made to the
investment adviser. The cumulative effect at September 1, 1999, and the yearly
net effect, of these corrections on net assets, net asset value per share and
the ratio of expenses were as follows:

    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
The Taiwan Fund, Inc.:


We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of The
Taiwan Fund, Inc., including the Fund's investments, as of August 31, 2005, and
the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of
changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.



We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of August 31, 2005 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers
were not received. An audit also incudes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.



In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Taiwan Fund, Inc. as of August 31, 2005, the results of its operations for the
year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in

    SUMMARY OF DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND

    CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS THE DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN?


The Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") offers
shareholders of The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") a prompt and simple way to
reinvest their dividends and capital gains distributions in shares of the Fund.
The Fund will distribute to shareholders, at least annually, substantially all
of its net income and expects to distribute annually its net realized capital
gains. EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"), a federally
chartered trust institution and a wholly owned subsidiary of Computershare
Shareholder Services, Inc., acts as Plan Administrator for shareholders in
administering the Plan. The Plan also allows you to make optional cash
investments in Fund shares through the Plan Administrator.


WHO CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN?

If you own shares in your own name, you can elect to participate directly in the
Plan. If you own shares that are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or
other nominee, you should contact your nominee to arrange for them to
participate on your behalf.

WHAT DOES THE PLAN OFFER?

The Plan has two components; reinvestment of dividends and capital gains
distributions, and a voluntary cash purchase feature.

REINVESTMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS DISTRIBUTIONS

If you choose to participate in the Plan, your dividends and capital gains
distributions will be promptly invested for you, automatically increasing your
holdings in the Fund. If the Fund declares a dividend or capital gains
distribution payable in cash, you will automatically receive shares purchased by
the Plan Administrator on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open
market.

If a distribution is declared which is payable in shares or cash at the option
of the shareholder and if on the valuation date (generally the payable date) the
market price of shares is equal to or exceeds their net asset value, the Fund
will issue new shares to you at the greater of the following: (a) net asset
value per share or (b) 95% of the market price per share. If the market price
per share on the valuation date is less than the net asset value per share, the
Fund will issue new shares to you at the market price per share on the valuation
date.

All reinvestments are in full and fractional shares, carried to three decimal
places. In the case of foreign (non-U.S.) shareholders, reinvestment will be
made net of applicable withholding tax.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE OPTION


Plan participants have the option of making investments in Fund shares through
the Plan Administrator. You may invest any amount from $100 to $3,000
semi-annually. The Plan Administrator will purchase shares for you on the New
York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market on or about February 15 and
August 15. If you hold shares in your own name, you should deal directly with
the Plan Administrator. Checks should be made payable to "Computershare". The
Plan Administrator will not accept cash, traveler's checks, money orders, or
third party checks for voluntary cash purchases. We suggest you send your check
to the following address to be received at least two business days before the
investment date: Computershare, c/o The Taiwan Fund, Inc. at P.O. Box 43010,
Providence, RI 02940-3010. The Plan Administrator will return any cash payments
received more than thirty days prior to February 15 or August 15, and you will
not receive interest on uninvested cash payments. If you own shares that are
held in the name


 26
<PAGE>
    SUMMARY OF DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND

    CASH PURCHASE PLAN (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your nominee to
arrange for them to participate in the cash purchase option on your behalf.

IS THERE A COST TO PARTICIPATE?

Each participant will pay a pro rata portion of brokerage commissions payable
with respect to purchases of shares by the Plan Administrator on the New York
Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market. Otherwise, there is no charge to
participants for reinvesting dividends and capital gains distributions, since
the Plan Administrator's fees are paid by the Fund. Brokerage charges for
purchasing shares through the Plan are expected to be less than the usual
brokerage charges for individual transactions, because the Plan Administrator
will purchase stock for all participants in blocks, resulting in lower
commissions for each individual participant.

For purchases from voluntary cash payments, participants are charged a service
fee of $.75 for each investment and a pro rata share of the brokerage
commissions.

Brokerage commissions and service fees, if any, will be deducted from amounts to
be invested.

WHAT ARE THE TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS?

You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to help
you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

If the Fund issues shares upon reinvestment of a dividend or capital gains
distribution, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount reportable in
respect of the reinvested amount of the dividend or distribution will be the
fair market value of the shares received as of the payment date, which will be
reportable as ordinary dividend income and/or long term capital gains. The
shares will have a tax basis equal to such fair market value, and the holding
period for the shares will begin on the day after the payment date. State, local
and foreign taxes may also be applicable.

ONCE ENROLLED IN THE PLAN, MAY I WITHDRAW FROM IT?


You may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by calling the Plan
Administrator at 1-800-426-5523, by accessing your Plan account at the Plan
Administrator's website, www.computershare.com/equiserve or by written notice to
the Plan Administrator.


If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in
your name for all full shares, or, if you wish, the Plan Administrator will sell
your shares and send you the proceeds, less a service fee of $2.50 and less
brokerage commissions. The Plan Administrator will convert any fractional shares
you hold at the time of your withdrawal to cash at the current market price and
send you a check for the proceeds.


All sale requests having an anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are
expected to be submitted in written form. In addition, all sale requests within
thirty (30) days of an address change are expected to be submitted in written
form.


                                                                              27

your shares are not held in your name, you should contact your brokerage firm,
bank, or other nominee for more information and to arrange for them to

Either the Fund or the Plan Administrator may amend or terminate the Plan.
Except in the case of amendments necessary or appropriate to comply with
applicable law, rules or policies or a regulatory authority, participants will
be mailed written notice at least 30 days before the effective date of any
amendment. In the case of termination, participants will be mailed written
notice at least 30 days before the record date of any dividend or capital gains
distribution by the Fund.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for The Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
     applies to the Fund's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer,
     President and Treasurer (or persons performing similar functions) ("Covered
     Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

     -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships.

     -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     -    prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest. The Fund will expect all Covered Officers to
comply at all times with the principles in this Code. A violation of this Code
by an employee is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including discharge
and possible legal prosecution. Any question about the application of the Code
should be referred to the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of Directors ( the
"Audit Committee").

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act")
and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Fund. The compliance
programs and procedures of the Fund and HSBC Asset Management (Taiwan) Ltd., the
Fund's investment


                                        1

<PAGE>

adviser (the "Adviser") are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions. Certain conflicts of interest also arise out of
the personal securities trading activities of the Covered Officers and the
possibility that they may use information regarding the Fund's securities
trading activities for their personal benefit. The Fund's Code of Ethics under
Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act is designed to address these
conflicts of interest. This Code does not, and is not intended to, replace these
programs and procedures or the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code of Ethics, and this Code's
provisions should be viewed as being additional and supplemental to such
programs, procedures and code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will,
in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the Adviser and the Fund. The
participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual relationship between the Fund and the Adviser and is consistent with
the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund.
Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board of
Directors (the "Board") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by other codes.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

     -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
          contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
          trade personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation
          of the market effect of such transactions.

     Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report all
material business affiliations outside the Fund and must update the report
annually.

     Covered Officers should avoid situations which involve the appearance of,
or potential for, conflicts of interest. Examples of these situations include:

     -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
          and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings, not
          including occasional meals or tickets to theatre or sporting events or
          other similar entertainment, provided it is


                                        2

<PAGE>

          business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place
          and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety.

     -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment adviser or any affiliated person thereof; and

     -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

     In situations involving a Covered Officer which involve the appearance of,
or the potential for, conflicts of interest, but where the Covered Officer
believes that no significant conflict of interest exist, the Covered Officer
must obtain prior written approval from the Audit Committee before becoming
involved in that situation. No such approval shall be considered a waiver of
this Code.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
          and compliance requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

     -    each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
          others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within
          or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's directors and auditors,
          or to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
          Fund and the Adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate,
          timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
          Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
          communications made by the Fund; and

     -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code or (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming
          a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     -    annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code;


                                        3

<PAGE>

     -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Fund or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
          that are made in good faith; and

     -    notify the Audit Committee promptly if he knows of any violation of
          this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The Audit Committee is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. Any waivers sought by a Covered
Officer must be considered by the Audit Committee.

     A copy of this Code shall be delivered to each employee of the Fund and
each employee of the Adviser annually together with a memorandum requesting that
any violations of the Code be communicated immediately to the Audit Committee.

     The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

     -    the Audit Committee will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to it;

     -    if, after such investigation, the Audit Committee believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Audit Committee is not required to take
          any further action;

     -    if the Audit Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it
          will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
          appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its board; or
          a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     -    the Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers of this
          Code, as appropriate; and

     -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   CHANGES TO OR WAIVERS OF THE CODE

     No change to or waiver of any provision of this Code will be effective

                     HSBC ASSET MANAGEMENT (TAIWAN) LIMITED

                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

                              As of August 1, 2003

<PAGE>

                     HSBC ASSET MANAGEMENT (TAIWAN) LIMITED

                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

     HSBC Asset Management (Taiwan) Limited (the "Advisor") is an investment
advisor registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, that serves
as the investment manager for the Taiwan Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") pursuant to a
Securities Investment Trust-Investment Management and Custodian Contract dated
August 22, 2001 (the "Management Contract") among the Fund, the Advisor and the
International Commercial Bank of China, the Fund's Taiwan custodian.

     Under the Taiwan Regulations Governing Securities Investment Trust Fund
Enterprises (the "SITE Regulations") and the Taiwan Rules Governing the Use of
Proxies for Attendance at Shareholder Meetings of Public Companies (the "Proxy
Rules"), the Advisor has the responsibility for exercising voting rights
("Voting Rights") on the shares of Taiwan companies held under the Management
Contract, and the Fund has delegated to the Advisor the duty to exercise Voting
Rights with respect to such shares. Under the SITE Regulations and the Proxy
Rules, the Advisor must exercise the Voting Rights on behalf of the Fund in a
manner which is in the best interests of the Fund; provided that the Advisor is
required to vote in favor of proposals made or candidates for director or
supervisor nominated by the Board of Directors of the company issuing the shares
which are being voted (the "Issuing Company") unless the Advisor determines that
there is unsound management of the Issuing Company which may cause damage to the
interests of the Issuing Company or its shareholders ("Unsound Management"). If
the Advisor determines that there is Unsound Management with respect to an the
Issuing Company, the SITE Regulations and the Proxy Rules require that the
shares at issue be voted in accordance with a resolution of the Board of
Directors of the Advisor.


                                       2

<PAGE>

     Under the U.S. Investment Advisors Act of 1940, the Advisor is a fiduciary
that owes the Fund a duty of care and loyalty with respect to all services it
undertakes on the Fund's behalf, including exercising Voting Rights. The Advisor
is therefore subject to a fiduciary duty, within the confines of applicable
Taiwan law, to exercise Voting Rights in a manner the Advisor believes is
consistent with the Fund's best interests. In fulfilling its obligations to the
Fund, the Advisor will seek to act in a manner that it believes is most likely
to enhance the economic value of the underlying securities held for the Fund
under the Management Contract.

Proxy Voting Committee

     In light of these fiduciary duties, and given the complexity of the issues
that may arise in connection with the exercise of Voting Rights, the Advisor has
formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee") to address issues on behalf of
the Advisor relating to the exercise of Voting Rights.

Scope of Committee Responsibilities

     The Committee shall have responsibility for determining how to exercise
Voting Rights. In doing so, the Committee will seek to ensure that Voting Rights
are exercised in the best interests of the Fund, and that Voting Rights are
exercised in a manner free from unwarranted influences.

     The Committee shall also establish the Advisor policies with respect to
Voting Rights, with such advice, participation and research as the Committee
deems appropriate from Portfolio Managers or other knowledgeable interested
parties. The Committee shall be responsible for determining how the Voting
Rights policies will be applied to specific votes, in light of each Issuing
Company's unique structure, management, strategic options and probable economic
consequences of alternative actions.


                                       3

<PAGE>

     In view of the requirements of Taiwan law with respect to the exercise of
Voting Rights, the Committee's primary focus will be on determining whether or
not voting in favor of proposals made by an Issuing Company's Board of Directors
or management are consistent with the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder. In circumstances where the Committee determines that voting in
favor of such a proposal (or a proposal supported by the Issuing Company's Board
of Directors) is consistent with the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder, the Committee will cause the Advisor to exercise the Voting Rights
in favor of the proposal following applicable Taiwan legal and voting
procedures. In circumstances where the Committee determines that voting shares
in favor of a proposal is clearly not in the best interests of the Fund as a
shareholder, the Committee will present the matter to the Board of Directors of
the Advisor in a timely manner with a recommendation that the Board of Directors
adopt a resolution authorizing the Advisor to vote against the proposal based on
the fact that the proposal reflects Unsound Management. The Advisor believes
that any circumstance where the Board of Directors or management of an Issuing
Company makes or supports a proposal submitted to a shareholder vote which is
clearly not in the best interests of shareholders reflects Unsound Management.

     The Committee will adopt policies with respect to recurring shareholder
voting matters, such as the election of directors and supervisors, which it
generally will follow with respect to these recurring matters and which are
attached to these voting guidelines. The Committee may, however, determine that
the subject matter of a proposal is not suitable for general voting guidelines
and requires a case-by-case determination. The Advisor believes that certain
Voting Rights issues require investment analysis - such as approval of mergers
and other significant corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and
are therefore not suitable for general guidelines.

     Pursuant to Article 44 of the SITE Regulations, prior to voting at a
shareholder meeting of an Issuing Company in which the Fund holds shares, the
Committee will prepare a written


                                       4

<PAGE>

report describing the assessment and analysis process used in determining how to
exercise the Voting Rights. In addition, if Voting Rights are exercised pursuant
to a resolution of the Advisor's Board of Directors, a written report of the
exercise of Voting Rights will be submitted to the Board after the shareholder
meeting.

     The Committee shall obtain copies of shareholder meeting notifications and
attendance cards and shall retain a written record of the exercise of Voting
Rights by the Advisor and the results of the voting. This record shall be kept
in consecutive order in files which shall be maintained for at least five years
after the shareholder meeting.

Committee Membership

     The Committee will be chaired by the Chief Investment Officer of the
Advisor responsible for the investment of the Fund's securities. The Committee
shall also include the deputy portfolio manager for the Fund, the Advisor's
senior compliance officer and such other personnel with investment and/or
relevant experience as the Chief Investment Officer deems appropriate. No
employee of the Advisor whose responsibilities relate primarily to marketing or
sales, and no person with any investment banking, trading, retail brokerage or
research responsibilities for the Advisor's affiliates may serve as a member of
the Committee or participate in its decision-making.

Circumstances Involving Conflicts of Interest

     In circumstances where the exercise of Voting Rights involves an actual or
apparent conflict of interest involving the Advisor or any of the Advisor's
affiliates, the decision regarding the exercise of Voting Rights will be made
exclusively by members of the Committee who have no personal involvement with or
relationship to the matter which produces the conflict of interest. For example,
if an Issuing Company is an investment advisory client of the Advisor, no
individual associated with the Advisor who has any relationship or involvement
with providing


                                       5

<PAGE>

advisory services to the Issuing Company shall participate in the decision with
respect to the exercise of those Voting Rights.


                                       6

<PAGE>

                                 VOTING POLICIES

     The Committee will analyze each exercise of Voting Rights individually. The
Committee has adopted the following voting guidelines, which represent the
Committee's usual voting position on certain recurring Voting Rights issues that
do not involve unusual circumstances. With respect to any Voting Rights issue,
however, the Committee may vote differently than a voting guideline if the
Committee determines that doing so is in the best interests of the Fund.

     (a)  Board of Directors

     The Committee's general policy is to vote for nominees for director in
uncontested elections, except for nominees which have demonstrably poor records
of representing shareholder interests.

     (b)  Auditors

     The Committee's general policy is to vote for approval of independent
auditors, except for

     -    Auditors that have a financial interest in, or material association
          with, the Issuing Company they are auditing, and are therefore
          believed not to be independent.

     -    Auditors who have rendered an opinion to any company which is either
          not consistent with best accounting practices or indicative of the
          company's financial situation.

     (c)  Compensation and Benefits

     The Committee's general policy is to recommend a vote against proposals
regarding compensation and benefits for senior executive officers and directors
of issuing companies which are clearly in excess of levels of compensation and
benefits provided typically by Taiwan companies in similar circumstances.
