ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

The Report to Shareholders is attached herewith.


                                      (THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST LOGO)

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST

                                  Annual Report
                                December 31, 2008

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

     The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires a fund's principal executive and financial
officers to certify the entire contents of the semi-annual and annual
shareholder reports in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Form N-CSR. This certification would cover the portfolio manager's commentary
and subjective opinions if they are attached to or a part of the financial
statements. Many of these comments and opinions would be difficult or impossible
to certify.

     Because we do not want our portfolio managers to eliminate their opinions
and/or restrict their commentary to historical facts, we have separated their
commentary from the financial statements and investment portfolio and have sent
it to you separately. Both the commentary and the financial statements,
including the portfolio of investments, will be available on our website at
www.gabelli.com.

     Enclosed are the audited financial statements and the investment portfolio
as of December 31, 2008.

     COST. CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE PERFORMANCE DATA
     PRESENTED. VISIT WWW.GABELLI.COM FOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION AS OF THE MOST
     RECENT MONTH END. PERFORMANCE RETURNS FOR PERIODS OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE

     UNMANAGED INDICATORS OF STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE. DIVIDENDS ARE CONSIDERED
     REINVESTED EXCEPT FOR THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX. YOU CANNOT INVEST

+++  Effective in 2008, a change in accounting policy was adopted with regard to
     the calculation of the portfolio turnover rate to include cash proceeds due
     to mergers. Had this policy been adopted retroactively, the portfolio
     turnover rate for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, 2005, and 2004
     would have been 58.0%, 30.8%, 39.5%, and 48.7%, respectively.

(a)  Calculated based upon average common shares outstanding on the record dates
     throughout the period.

(b)  The ratios do not include a reduction of expenses for custodian fee credits
     on cash balances maintained with the custodian. Including such custodian
     fee credits for the year ended December 31, 2007, the ratios of operating
     expenses to average net assets attributable to common shares net of fee
     reduction would have been 1.37% and the ratios of operating expenses to
     average net assets including liquidation value of preferred shares net of
     fee reduction would have been 1.10%. For the years ended December 31, 2008,
     2006, and 2005, the effect of the custodian fee credits was minimal.

(c)  Based on weekly prices.

(d)  Asset coverage is calculated by combining all series of preferred shares.

(e)  Amount represents less than $0.005 per share.

                      THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION. The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (the "Fund") is a
non-diversified closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware
statutory trust on November 18, 2003 and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). Investment operations commenced on
November 28, 2003.

     The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of total return
on its assets with an emphasis on dividends and income. The Fund will attempt to
achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal market conditions,
at least 80% of its assets in dividend paying securities (such as common and
preferred stock) or other income producing securities (such as fixed income debt
securities and securities that are convertible into equity securities).

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION. Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's official closing price as of the close of business on the
day the securities are being valued. If there were no sales that day, the
security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or, if
there were no asked prices quoted on that day, then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such
day, the security is valued at the most recently available price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio
securities traded on more than one national securities exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most representative market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

     Portfolio securities primarily traded on a foreign market are generally
valued at the preceding closing values of such securities on the relevant
market, but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures established by the Board
if market conditions change significantly after the close of the foreign market
but prior to the close of business on the day the securities are being valued.
Debt instruments with remaining maturities of 60 days or less that are not
credit impaired are valued at amortized cost, unless the Board determines such
amount does not reflect the securities' fair value, in which case these
securities will be fair valued as determined by the Board. Debt instruments
having a maturity greater than 60 days for which market quotations are readily
available are valued at the average of the latest bid and asked prices. If there
were no asked prices quoted on such day, the security is valued using the
closing bid price. Futures contracts are valued at the closing settlement price
of the exchange or board of trade on which the applicable contract is traded.

     Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are fair valued as determined by the Board. Fair valuation methodologies and
procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and review of available
financial and non-financial information about the company; comparisons with the
valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, including a comparison
of foreign securities with the equivalent U.S. dollar value ADR securities at
the close of the U.S. exchange; and evaluation of any other information that
could be indicative of the value of the security.

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements" ("SFAS 157") clarifies the definition of fair value for financial
reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires
additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS 157 are described below:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities;

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
          risk, etc.); and

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's
          determinations as to the fair value of investments).

     The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. The
summary of the Fund's investments and other financial instruments, by inputs
used to value the Fund's investments as of December 31, 2008 is, as follows:

                      THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 161, "Disclosures about
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 161") that is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 is intended to
improve financial reporting for derivative instruments by requiring enhanced
disclosure that enables investors to understand how and why an entity uses
derivatives, how derivatives are accounted for, and how derivative instruments
affect an entity's results of operations and financial position. Management is
currently evaluating the implications of SFAS 161 on the Fund's financial
statement disclosures.

     REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary government securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System, or with other brokers or
dealers that meet credit guidelines established by the Adviser and reviewed by
the Board. Under the terms of a typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes
possession of an underlying debt obligation subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase, and the Fund to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby determining the yield during the Fund's holding period.
It is the policy of the Fund to always receive and maintain securities as
collateral whose market value, including accrued interest, are at least equal to
102% of the dollar amount invested by the Fund in each agreement. The Fund will
make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or upon evidence of
book entry transfer of the collateral to the account of the custodian. To the
extent that any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of
the collateral is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of
the collateral. If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines
or if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced with respect to the seller of the
security, realization of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.
At December 31, 2008, there were no open repurchase agreements.

     OPTIONS. The Fund may purchase or write call or put options on securities
or indices. As a writer of put options, the Fund receives a premium at the
outset and then bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the
financial instrument underlying the option. The Fund would incur a loss if the
price of the underlying financial instrument decreases between the date the
option is written and the date on which the option is terminated. The Fund would
realize a gain, to the extent of the premium, if the price of the financial
instrument increases between those dates. If a written call option is exercised,
the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying security in
determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a written put
option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security.

     As a purchaser of put options, the Fund pays a premium for the right to
sell to the seller of the put option the underlying security at a specified
price. The seller of the put has the obligation to purchase the underlying
security upon exercise at the exercise price. If the price of the underlying
security declines, the Fund would realize a gain upon sale or exercise. If the
price of the underlying security increases or stays the same, the Fund would
realize a loss upon sale or at the expiration date, but only to the extent of
the premium paid.

     In the case of call options, these exercise prices are referred to as
"in-the-money," "at-the-money," and "out-of-the-money," respectively. The Fund
may write (a) in-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the price
of the underlying security will remain stable or decline during the option
period, (b) covered at-the-money call options when the Adviser expects that the
price of the underlying security will remain stable, decline or advance
moderately during the option period, and (c) out-of-the-money call options when
the Adviser expects that the premiums received from writing the call option will
be greater than the appreciation in the price of the underlying security above
the exercise price. By writing a call option, the Fund limits its opportunity to
profit from any increase in the market value of the underlying security above
the exercise price of the option. Out-of-the-money, at-the-money, and
in-the-money put options (the reverse of call options as to the relation of
exercise price to market price) may be utilized in the same market environments
that such call options are used in equivalent transactions. At December 31,
2008, the Fund had no investments in options.

     SWAP AGREEMENTS. The Fund may enter into equity, contract for difference,
and interest rate swap or cap transactions. The use of swaps and caps is a
highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks
different from those associated with ordinary portfolio transactions. Swap
agreements may involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and counterparty
risk, and exposure to loss in excess of the related amounts reflected in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In an interest rate swap, the Fund would
agree to pay to the other party to the interest rate swap (which is known as the
"counterparty") periodically a fixed rate payment in exchange for the
counterparty agreeing to pay to the Fund periodically a variable rate payment
that is intended to approximate the Fund's variable rate payment obligation on
Series B Preferred Shares. In an interest rate cap, the Fund would pay a premium
to the counterparty and, to the extent that a specified variable rate index
exceeds a predetermined fixed rate, would receive from that counterparty
payments of the difference based on the notional amount of such cap. In a swap,
a set of future cash flows are exchanged between two counterparties. One of
these cash flow streams will typically be based on a reference interest rate
combined with the performance of a notional value of shares of a stock. The
other will be based on the performance of the shares of a stock. Swap and cap
transactions introduce additional risk because the Fund would remain obligated
to pay preferred share dividends when due in accordance with the Statement of
Preferences even if the counterparty defaulted. If there is a default by the
counterparty to a swap contract, the Fund will be limited to contractual
remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. There is no
assurance that the swap contract counterparties will be able to meet their
obligations pursuant to a swap contract or that, in the event of default, the
Fund will succeed in

pursuing contractual remedies. The Fund thus assumes the risk that it may be
delayed in or prevented from obtaining payments owed to it pursuant to a swap
contract. The creditworthiness of the swap contract counterparties is closely
monitored in order to minimize this risk. Depending on the general state of
short-term interest rates and the returns on the Fund's portfolio securities at
that point in time, such a default could negatively affect the Fund's ability to
make dividend payments. In addition, at the time a swap or a cap transaction
reaches its scheduled termination date, there is a risk that the Fund will not
be able to obtain a replacement transaction or that the terms of the replacement
will not be as favorable as on the expiring transaction. If this occurs, it
could have a negative impact on the Fund's ability to make dividend payments.

     The use of derivative instruments involves, to varying degrees, elements of
market and counterparty risk in excess of the amount recognized below.

     Unrealized gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
The change in value of swaps, including the accrual of periodic amounts of
interest to be paid or received on swaps, is reported as unrealized gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations. A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements.

     The Fund has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement the Fund receives a variable rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at December 31, 2008 are as follows:

     FUTURES CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in futures contracts for the purpose
of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and in the
value of securities it intends to purchase. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Fund is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the
value of the contract, which are included in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on investments and futures contracts. The Fund
recognizes a realized gain or loss when the contract is closed.

     There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a hedging instrument. The change in value of futures contracts primarily
corresponds with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not
correlate with the change in value of the hedged investments. In addition, there
is the risk that the Fund may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid secondary market. At December 31, 2008, there were no
open futures contracts.

     SECURITIES SOLD SHORT. The Fund may enter into short sale transactions.
Short selling involves selling securities that may or may not be owned and, at
times, borrowing the same securities for delivery to the purchaser, with an
obligation to replace such borrowed securities at a later date. The proceeds
received from short sales are recorded as liabilities and the Fund records an
unrealized gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds
received and the value of an open short position on the day of determination.
The Fund records a realized gain or loss when the short position is closed out.
By entering into a short sale, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable
change in the price of the security sold short. Dividends on short sales are
recorded as an expense by the Fund on the ex-dividend date and interest expense
is recorded on the accrual basis. The Fund did not hold any short positions as
of December 31, 2008.

     FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. The Fund may engage in forward foreign
exchange contracts for hedging a specific transaction with respect to either the
currency in which the transaction is denominated or another currency as deemed
appropriate by the Adviser. Forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at the
forward rate and are marked-to-market daily. The change in market value is
included in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign
currency translations. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the
time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

                       THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

     The use of forward foreign exchange contracts does not eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Fund's portfolio securities, but it
does establish a rate of exchange that can be achieved in the future. Although
forward foreign exchange contracts limit the risk of loss due to a decline in
the value of the hedged currency, they also limit any potential gain that might
result should the value of the currency increase. In addition, the Fund could be
exposed to risks if the counterparties to the contracts are unable to meet the
terms of their contracts. At December 31, 2008, there were no open forward
foreign exchange contracts.

     FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS. The books and records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Foreign currencies, investments, and other assets
and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rates.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, income, and expenses are
translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective dates of such
transactions. Unrealized gains and losses that result from changes in foreign
exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities have been included
in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency
translations. Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting from
changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between
trade date and settlement date on investment securities transactions, foreign
currency transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and
dividends recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually received.
The portion of foreign currency gains and losses related to fluctuation in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent sale trade date is
included in realized gain/loss on investments.

     FOREIGN SECURITIES. The Fund may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers. Investing in securities of foreign issuers involves special risks not
typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. The risks
include possible revaluation of currencies, the ability to repatriate funds,
less complete financial information about companies, and possible future adverse
political and economic developments. Moreover, securities of many foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

     FOREIGN TAXES. The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on
investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable.
The Fund will accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable, based upon its
current interpretation of tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

     RESTRICTED AND ILLIQUID SECURITIES. The Fund is not subject to an
independent limitation on the amount it may invest in securities for which the
markets are illiquid. Illiquid securities include securities the disposition of
which is subject to substantial legal or contractual restrictions. The sale of
illiquid securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage
charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than does the sale of
securities eligible for trading on national securities exchanges or in the
over-the-counter markets. Restricted securities may sell at a price lower than
similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale. Securities
freely saleable among qualified institutional investors under special rules
adopted by the SEC may be treated as liquid if they satisfy liquidity standards
established by the Board. The continued liquidity of such securities is not as
well assured as that of publicly traded securities, and accordingly the Board
will monitor their liquidity.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted for on the trade date with realized gain or loss on investments
determined by using the identified cost method. Interest income (including
amortization of premium and accretion of discount) is recorded on the accrual
basis. Premiums and discounts on debt securities are amortized using the
effective yield to maturity method. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date except for certain dividends which are recorded as soon as the
Fund is informed of the dividend.

     CUSTODIAN FEE CREDITS AND INTEREST EXPENSE. When cash balances are
maintained in the custody account, the Fund receives credits which are used to
offset custodian fees. The gross expenses paid under the custody arrangement are
included in custodian fees in the Statement of Operations with the corresponding
expense offset, if any, shown as "custodian fee credits." When cash balances are
overdrawn, the Fund is charged an overdraft fee of 2.00% above the federal funds
rate on outstanding balances. This amount, if any, would be included in
"interest expense" in the Statement of Operations.

     DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS. Distributions to common shareholders are
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to shareholders are based on
income and capital gains as determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from income and capital gains as determined under
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities
and foreign currency transactions held by the Fund, timing differences, and
differing characterizations of distributions made by the Fund. Distributions
from net investment income include net realized gains on foreign currency
transactions. These book/tax differences are either temporary or permanent in
nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, adjustments are made to
the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the differences arise. These
reclassifications have no impact on the NAV of the Fund. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, reclassifications were made to decrease accumulated net
investment income by $164,319 and to decrease accumulated distributions in
excess of net realized gain on investments, swap contracts, and foreign currency
transactions by $164,319.

     PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"). It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the
requirements of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its net investment company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

     At December 31, 2008, the Fund had net capital loss carryforwards for
federal income tax purposes of $22,445,283, which are available to reduce future
required distributions of net capital gains to shareholders through 2016.

     Under the current tax law, capital losses related to securities and foreign
currency realized after October 31 and prior to the Fund's fiscal year end may
be treated as occurring on the first day of the following year. For the year
ended December 31, 2008, the Fund deferred capital losses of $2,960,639.

     At December 31, 2008, the difference between book basis and tax basis
unrealized depreciation was primarily due to deferral of losses from wash sales
for tax purposes and basis adjustments for investments in partnerships.

     As of December 31, 2008, the components of accumulated earnings/losses on a
tax basis were as follows:

     FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
("FIN 48") provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented, and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the
course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax
positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax
authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold
are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. In accordance with
FIN 48, management has analyzed the Fund's tax positions taken on the federal
and state income tax returns for all open tax years (the current and prior three
tax years) and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the
Fund's financial statements. Management's determination regarding FIN 48 may be
subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but
not limited to, an on-going analysis of tax laws, regulations, and
interpretations thereof.

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES. The Fund has an investment
advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with the Adviser which provides
that the Fund will pay the Adviser a fee, computed weekly and paid monthly,
equal on an annual basis to 1.00% of the value of the Fund's average weekly net
assets including the liquidation value of preferred shares. In accordance with
the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser provides a continuous investment program for
the Fund's portfolio and oversees the administration of all aspects of the
Fund's business and affairs. The Adviser has agreed to reduce the management fee
on the incremental assets attributable to the Preferred Shares if the total
return of the NAV of the common shares of the Fund, including

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

distributions and advisory fee subject to reduction, does not exceed the stated
dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular series of the
Preferred Shares for the year.

     The Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares is monitored on a
monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the NAV of the common shares
exceeds the stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate of each particular
series of Preferred Shares for the period. For the year ended December 31, 2008,
the Fund's total return on the NAV of the common shares did not exceed the
stated dividend rate or corresponding swap rate on any of the outstanding
Preferred Shares. Thus, management fees with respect to the liquidation value of
the preferred share assets were reduced by $4,948,148.

     During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund paid brokerage
commissions on security trades of $737,066 to Gabelli & Company, Inc. ("Gabelli
& Company"), an affiliate of the Adviser.

     The cost of calculating the Fund's NAV per share is a Fund expense pursuant
to the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, the Fund paid or accrued $45,000 to the Adviser in
connection with the cost of computing the Fund's NAV.

     As per the approval of the Board, the Fund compensates officers of the
Fund, who are employed by the Fund and are not employed by the Adviser (although
the officers may receive incentive based variable compensation from affiliates
of the Adviser) and pays its allocated portion of the cost of the Fund's Chief
Compliance Officer. For the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund paid or
accrued $215,342, which is included in payroll expenses in the Statement of
Operations.

     The Fund pays each Trustee who is not considered to be an affiliated person
an annual retainer of $12,000 plus $1,500 for each Board meeting attended in
person and $500 per telephonic meeting, and they are reimbursed for any out of
pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings. All Board committee members
receive $1,000 per meeting attended. In addition, the Audit Committee Chairman
receives an annual fee of $3,000, the Proxy Voting Committee Chairman receives
an annual fee of $1,500, the Nominating Committee Chairman receives an annual
fee of $2,000, and the Lead Trustee receives an annual fee of $1,000. Trustees
who are directors or employees of the Adviser or an affiliated company receive
no compensation or expense reimbursement from the Fund.

     4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES. Purchases and proceeds from the sales of
securities for the year ended December 31, 2008, other than short-term
securities and U.S Government obligations, aggregated $625,053,238 and
$679,411,774, respectively.

     Purchases and sales of U.S. Government obligations for the year ended
December 31, 2008, other than short-term obligations, aggregated $11,516,200 and
$11,360,000, respectively.

     5. CAPITAL. The Fund is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common
shares of beneficial interest (par value $0.001). The Board has authorized the
repurchase and retirement of its shares on the open market when the shares are
trading at a discount of 7.5% or more (or such other percentage as the Board may
determine from time to time) from the NAV of the shares. During the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Fund repurchased 300,433 shares of beneficial interest in
the open market at a cost of $3,449,357 and an average discount of approximately
19.07% from its NAV. All shares of beneficial interest repurchased have been
retired.

     The Fund's Declaration of Trust, as amended, authorizes the issuance of an
unlimited number of shares of $0.001 par value Cumulative Preferred Shares. The
Cumulative Preferred Shares is senior to the common shares and results in the
financial leveraging of the common shares. Such leveraging tends to magnify both
the risks and opportunities to common shareholders. Dividends on shares of the
Cumulative Preferred Shares are cumulative. The Fund is required by the 1940 Act
and by the Statements of Preferences to meet certain asset coverage tests with
respect to the Cumulative Preferred Shares. If the Fund fails to meet these
requirements and does not correct such failure, the Fund may be required to
redeem, in part or in full, the 5.875% Series A, Series B Auction Market, Series
C Auction Market, 6.00% Series D, and Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Shares at redemption prices of $25, $25,000, $25,000, $25, and $25,000,
respectively, per share plus an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid
dividends whether or not declared on such shares in order to meet these
requirements. Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing asset coverage
requirements could restrict the Fund's ability to pay dividends to common
shareholders and could lead to sales of portfolio securities at inopportune
times. The income received on the Fund's assets may vary in a manner unrelated
to the fixed and variable rates, which could have either a beneficial or
detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to common
shareholders.

     At the Fund's August 15, 2007 Board meeting, the Board approved the filing
of a shelf registration with the SEC which will give the Fund the ability to
offer additional preferred shares. The shelf registration was declared effective
by the SEC on June 17, 2008.

     On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of $77,280,971 (after
underwriting discounts of $2,520,000 and offering expenses of $199,029) from the
public offering of 3,200,000 shares of 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred
Shares. Commencing

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

October 12, 2009 and thereafter, the Fund, at its option, may redeem the 5.875%
Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares in whole or in part at the redemption price
at any time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of Series A Cumulative
Preferred Shares in the open market at prices less than the $25 liquidation
value per share. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund repurchased
and retired 71,584 shares of 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares in the
open market at a cost of $1,386,077 and an average discount of approximately
30.39% from its liquidation preference. At December 31, 2008, 3,128,416 shares
of 5.875% Series A Cumulative Preferred Shares were outstanding and accrued
dividends amounted to $76,581.

     On October 12, 2004, the Fund received net proceeds of $217,488,958 (after
underwriting discounts of $2,200,000 and offering expenses of $311,042) from the
public offering of 4,000 shares of Series B and 4,800 shares of Series C Auction
Market Cumulative Preferred Shares ("Series B and Series C Shares"),
respectively. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is
generally held every seven days, is expected to vary with short-term interest
rates. Since February 2008, the number of Series B and Series C Shares subject
to bid orders by potential holders has been less than the number of Series B and
Series C Shares subject to sell orders. Therefore, the weekly auctions have
failed, and the dividend rate since then has been the maximum rate. Holders that
have submitted sell orders have not been able to sell any or all of the Series B
or Series C Shares for which they have submitted sell orders. The current
maximum rate for both Series B and Series C Shares is 125 basis points greater
than the seven day Telerate/British Bankers Association LIBOR rate on the day of
such auction. The dividend rates of Series B Shares ranged from 1.575% to 5.500%
during the year ended December 31, 2008. The dividend rates of Series C Shares
ranged from 1.511% to 6.013% during the year ended December 31, 2008. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such shares on each
auction date. Series B and C Shares shareholders may also trade their shares in
the secondary market. The Fund, at its option, may redeem the Series B and C
Shares in whole or in part at the redemption price at any time. During the year
ended December 31, 2008, the Fund redeemed and retired 400 shares of Series B
and 480 shares of Series C Shares. Shareholders received the redemption price of
$25,000 per share, which was equal to the liquidation preference, together with
any accumulated and unpaid dividends, for each share redeemed. At December 31,
2008, 3,600 and 4,320 shares of the Series B and C Shares were outstanding with
an annualized dividend rate of 1.651% and 1.690% per share and accrued dividends
amounted to $4,128 and $30,420, respectively.

     On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of $62,617,239 (after
underwriting discounts of $2,047,500 and offering expenses of $335,261) from the
public offering of 2,600,000 shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred
Shares. Commencing November 3, 2010 and thereafter, the Fund, at its option, may
redeem the 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred Shares in whole or in part at the
redemption price at any time. The Board has authorized the repurchase of Series
D Cumulative Preferred Shares in the open market at prices less than the $25
liquidation value per share. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Fund
repurchased and retired 23,466 shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred
Shares in the open market at a cost of $471,019 and an average discount of
approximately 19.76% from its liquidation preference. At December 31, 2008,
2,576,534 shares of 6.00% Series D Cumulative Preferred Shares were outstanding
and accrued dividends amounted to $64,413.

     On November 3, 2005, the Fund received net proceeds of $133,379,387 (after
underwriting discounts of $1,350,000 and offering expenses of $270,613) from the
public offering of 5,400 shares of Series E Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Shares ("Series E Shares"). The dividend rate, as set by the auction process,
which is generally held every seven days, is expected to vary with short-term
interest rates. Since February 2008 the number of Series E Shares subject to bid
orders by potential holders has been less than the number of Series E Shares
subject to sell orders. Therefore the weekly auctions have failed, and the
dividend rate since then has been the maximum rate. Holders that have submitted
sell orders have not been able to sell any or all of the Series E Shares for
which they have submitted sell orders. The current maximum rate is 150 basis
points greater than the seven day Telerate/British Bankers Association LIBOR
rate on the day of such auction. The dividend rates of Series E Shares ranged
from 1.770% to 6.778% during the year ended December 31, 2008. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid, or sell such shares on each
auction date. Shareholders of the Series E Shares may also trade their shares in
the secondary market. The Fund, at its option, may redeem the Series E Shares in
whole or in part at the redemption price at any time. During the year ended
December 31, 2008, the Fund redeemed and retired 540 shares of Series E Shares.
Shareholders received the redemption price of $25,000 per share, which was equal
to the liquidation preference together, with any accumulated and unpaid
dividends, for each share redeemed. At December 31, 2008, 4,860 shares of Series
E Shares were outstanding with an annualized dividend rate of 1.940% and accrued
dividends amounted to $39,285.

     The holders of Cumulative Preferred Shares generally are entitled to one
vote per share held on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders of the
Fund and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single class. The
holders of Cumulative Preferred Shares voting together as a single class also
have the right currently to elect two Trustees and under certain circumstances
are entitled to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In addition, the
affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of
all outstanding shares of the Preferred Shares, voting as a single class, will
be required to approve any plan of

reorganization adversely affecting the Preferred Shares, and the approval of
two-thirds of each class, voting separately, of the Fund's outstanding voting
stock must approve the conversion of the Fund from a closed-end to an open-end
investment company. The approval of a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of
the outstanding Preferred Shares and a majority (as defined in the 1940 Act) of
the Fund's outstanding voting securities are required to approve certain other
actions, including changes in the Fund's investment objectives or fundamental
investment policies.

6. TRANSACTIONS IN SECURITIES OF AFFILIATED ISSUERS. The 1940 Act defines
affiliated issuers as those in which the Fund's holdings of an issuer represent
5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer. A summary of the
Fund's transactions in the securities of this issuer during the year ended
December 31, 2008 is set forth below:

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS. The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. OTHER MATTERS. On April 24, 2008, the Adviser entered into an administrative
settlement with the SEC to resolve the SEC's inquiry regarding prior frequent
trading activity in shares of the GAMCO Global Growth Fund (the "Global Growth
Fund") by one investor who was banned from the Global Growth Fund in August
2002. In the settlement, the SEC found that the Adviser had violated Section
206(2) of the Investment Advisers Act, Section 17(d) of the 1940 Act, and Rule
17d-1 thereunder and had aided and abetted and caused violations of Section
12(d)(1)(B)(i) of the 1940 Act. Under the terms of the settlement, the Adviser,
while neither admitting nor denying the SEC's findings and allegations, agreed,
among other things, to pay the previously reserved total of $16 million
(including a $5 million penalty), of which at least $11 million will be
distributed to shareholders of the Global Growth Fund in accordance with a plan
to be developed by an independent distribution consultant and approved by the
independent directors of the Global Growth Fund and the staff of the SEC and to
cease and desist from future violations of the above referenced federal
securities laws. The settlement is not expected to impact the Fund and will not
have a material adverse impact on the Adviser or its ability to fulfill its
obligations under the Advisory Agreement. On the same day, the SEC filed a civil
action against the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the
Adviser, alleging violations of certain federal securities laws arising from the
same matter. The officer is also an officer of the Global Growth Fund and other
funds in the Gabelli/GAMCO fund complex including the Fund. The officer denies
the allegations and is continuing in his positions with the Adviser and the
funds. The Adviser currently expects that any resolution of the action against
the officer will not have a material adverse impact on the Adviser or its
ability to fulfill its obligations under the Advisory Agreement.

     In a separate matter, on January 12, 2009, the SEC issued an administrative
action approving a final settlement of a previously disclosed matter with the
Adviser involving compliance with Section 19(a) of the Investment Company Act of
1940 and Rule 19a-1 thereunder by two closed-end funds. These provisions require
registered investment companies when making a distribution in the nature of a
dividend from sources other than net investment income to contemporaneously
provide written statements to shareholders, which adequately disclose the source
or sources of such distribution. While the two funds sent annual statements and
provided other materials containing this information, the shareholders did not
receive the notices required by Rule 19a-1 with any of the distributions that
were made for 2002 and 2003. The Adviser believes that the funds have been in
compliance with Section 19(a) and Rule 19a-1 since the beginning of 2004. As
part of the settlement, in which the Adviser neither admits nor denies the
findings by the SEC, the Adviser agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of
$450,000 and to cease and desist from causing violations of Section 19(a) and
Rule 19a-1. In connection with the settlement, the SEC noted the remedial
actions previously undertaken by the Adviser. The staff's notice to the Adviser
did not relate to the Fund.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust
(hereafter referred to as the "Trust") at December 31, 2008, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2008 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

CORPORATE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION, QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME, AND U.S.
GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INCOME

     In 2008, the Fund paid to common, 5.875% Series A, and 6.00% Series D
Cumulative Preferred shareholders ordinary income dividends of $0.27910,
$1.4658255, and $1.49700 per share, respectively. The Fund paid weekly
distributions to Series B, C, and E preferred shareholders at varying rates
throughout the year, including ordinary income dividends totaling $944.35220,
$966.50741, and $1,044.21367 per share, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2008, 76.0% of the ordinary dividend qualified for the dividends
received deduction available to corporations, and 100.00% of the ordinary income
distribution was qualified dividend income. The percentage of ordinary income
dividends paid by the Fund during 2008 derived from U.S. Treasury securities was
1.03%. Such income is exempt from state and local tax in all states. However,
many states, including New York and California, allow a tax exemption for a
portion of the income earned only if a mutual fund has invested at least 50% of
its assets at the end of each quarter of the Fund's fiscal year in U.S.
Government securities. The Fund did not meet this strict requirement in 2008.
The percentage of net assets of U.S. Treasury securities held as of December 31,
2008 was 7.5%.

                      THE GABELLI DIVIDEND & INCOME TRUST
  ANNUAL APPROVAL OF CONTINUANCE OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (UNAUDITED)

During the six months ended December 31, 2008, the Board of Trustees of the
Trust approved the continuation of the investment advisory agreement with the
Adviser for the Trust on the basis of the recommendation by the trustees (the
"Independent Board Members") who are not "interested persons" of the Trust. The
following paragraphs summarize the material information and factors considered
by the Independent Board Members as well as their conclusions relative to such
factors.

1) THE NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE ADVISER.

The Independent Board Members considered information regarding the portfolio
managers, the depth of the analyst pool available to the Adviser and the
portfolio managers, the scope of administrative, shareholder, and other services
supervised or provided by the Adviser and the absence of significant service
problems reported to the Board. The Independent Board Members noted the
experience, length of service, and reputation of the portfolio managers.

2) THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND, THE ADVISER.

The Independent Board Members reviewed the performance of the Fund over one,
two, and three year periods against a peer group of equity closed-end funds
prepared by Lipper. The Board Members noted the Fund's below average relative
performance for the one year period, average relative performance for the two
year period, and above average performance for the three year period. The Board
Members also noted that the Fund has not achieved its initial goal of earning at
least 9% per year.

3) THE COST OF THE ADVISORY SERVICES AND THE PROFITS TO THE ADVISER AND ITS
AFFILIATES FROM THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FUND.

The Independent Board Members reviewed summary data regarding the profitability
of the Fund to the Adviser.

4) THE EXTENT TO WHICH ECONOMIES OF SCALE WILL BE REALIZED AS THE FUND GROWS AND
WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT THOSE ECONOMIES OF SCALE.

The Independent Board Members noted that the Fund was a closed-end fund trading
at a discount to net asset value and accordingly unlikely to achieve growth of
the type that might lead to economies of scale that the shareholders would not
participate in. The Independent Board Members noted that the investment
management fee schedule for the Fund does not take into account any potential
economies of scale that may develop.

5) OTHER FACTORS.

The Independent Board Members compared the expense ratios of the investment
management fee, other expenses, and total expenses of the Fund with similar
expense ratios of the Lipper peer group of equity closed-end value funds and
noted that the Adviser's management fee includes substantially all
administrative services of the Fund as well as investment advisory services. The
Board noted that the Fund was larger than average within the peer group and that
its expense ratios were slightly below average. The Board Members also noted
that the management fee structure was the same as that in effect for most of the
Gabelli funds. The Board Members were presented with, but did not attach
significance to, information comparing the management fee to the fee for other
types of accounts managed by an affiliate of the Adviser.

The Independent Board Members concluded that the Fund enjoyed highly experienced
portfolio management services, good ancillary services, and a favorable
performance record. The Independent Board Members also concluded that the Fund's
expense ratios and the profitability to the Adviser of managing the Fund were
reasonable, and that economies of scale were not a significant factor in their
thinking. The Board Members did not view the potential profitability of
ancillary services as material to their decision. On the basis of the foregoing
and without assigning particular weight to any single conclusion, the
Independent Board Members determined to recommend continuation of the Advisory
Agreement to the full Board of Board Members.

The Annual Meeting of The Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust's shareholders will be
held on Monday, May 18, 2009 at the Greenwich Library in Greenwich, Connecticut.

         of the registrant is responsible for pre-approving (i) all audit and
         permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent
         registered public accounting firm to the registrant and (ii) all
         permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent
         registered public accounting firm to the Adviser, Gabelli Funds, LLC,
         and any affiliate of Gabelli Funds, LLC ("Gabelli") that provides
         services to the registrant (a "Covered Services Provider") if the
         independent registered public accounting firm's engagement related
         directly to the operations and financial reporting of the registrant.
         The Committee may delegate its responsibility to pre-approve any such
         audit and permissible non-audit services to the Chairperson of the
         Committee, and the Chairperson must report to the Committee, at its
         next regularly scheduled meeting after the Chairperson's pre-approval

         establish detailed pre-approval policies and procedures for
         pre-approval of such services in accordance with applicable laws,
         including the delegation of some or all of the Committee's pre-approval
         responsibilities to the other persons (other than Gabelli or the
         registrant's officers). Pre-approval by the Committee of any
         permissible non-audit services is not required so long as: (i) the
         permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the registrant at
         the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (ii) such
         services are promptly brought to the attention of the Committee and
         approved by the Committee or Chairperson prior to the completion of the
         audit.

 (e)(2)  The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
         (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to
         paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

                           (b) 100%

                           (c) 100%

                           (d) N/A

     (f) The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
         engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons
         other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees
         was zero percent (0%).
<PAGE>

     (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
         services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
         investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the registrant for each of the last two fiscal years of the
         registrant was $0 for 2007 and $0 for 2008.

     (h) The registrant's audit committee of the board of directors has
         considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
         rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not including any
         sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any
         entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
         investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant
         that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
         accountant's independence.



ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant has a separately designated audit committee consisting of the
following members: Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr., Anthonie C. van Ekris and Salvatore
J. Zizza.



ITEM 6. INVESTMENTS.

(a)   Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the
      close of the reporting period is included as part of the report to
      shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

(b)   Not applicable.



ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.


                   THE VOTING OF PROXIES ON BEHALF OF CLIENTS


         Rules 204(4)-2 and 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and
Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 require investment advisers
to adopt written policies and procedures governing the voting of proxies on
behalf of their clients.

         These procedures will be used by GAMCO Asset Management Inc., Gabelli
Funds, LLC, Gabelli Securities, Inc., and Teton Advisors, Inc. (collectively,
the "Advisers") to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio
securities held by their clients, including the procedures that the Advisers use
when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of the shareholders of an
investment company managed by one of the Advisers, on the one hand, and those of
the Advisers; the principal underwriter; or any affiliated person of the
investment company, the Advisers, or the principal underwriter. These procedures
will not apply where the Advisers do not have voting discretion or where the
Advisers have agreed to with a client to vote the client's proxies in accordance
with specific guidelines or procedures supplied by the client (to the extent
permitted by ERISA).

I.       PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

         The Proxy Voting Committee was originally formed in April 1989 for the
purpose of formulating guidelines and reviewing proxy statements within the
parameters set by the substantive proxy voting guidelines originally published
in 1988 and updated periodically, a copy of which are appended as Exhibit A. The
Committee will include representatives of Research, Administration, Legal, and
the Advisers. Additional or replacement members of the Committee will be
nominated by the Chairman and voted upon by the entire Committee.

           Meetings are held as needed basis to form views on the manner in
which the Advisers should vote proxies on behalf of their clients.

         In general, the Director of Proxy Voting Services, using the Proxy
Guidelines, recommendations of Institutional Shareholder Corporate Governance
Service ("ISS"), other third-party services and the analysts of Gabelli &
Company, Inc., will determine how to vote on each issue. For non-controversial
matters, the Director of Proxy Voting Services may vote the proxy if the vote is
(1) consistent with the recommendations of the issuer's Board of Directors and
not contrary to the Proxy Guidelines; (2) consistent with the recommendations of
the issuer's Board of Directors and is a non-controversial issue not covered by
the Proxy Guidelines; or (3) the vote is contrary to the recommendations of the
Board of Directors but is consistent with the Proxy Guidelines. In those
instances, the Director of Proxy Voting Services or the Chairman of the
Committee may sign and date the proxy statement indicating how each issue will
be voted.

         All matters identified by the Chairman of the Committee, the Director
of Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department as controversial, taking into
account the recommendations of ISS or other third party services and the
analysts of Gabelli & Company, Inc., will be presented to the Proxy Voting
Committee. If the Chairman of the Committee, the Director of Proxy Voting
Services or the Legal Department has identified the matter as one that (1) is
controversial; (2) would benefit from deliberation by the Proxy Voting
Committee; or (3) may give rise to a conflict of interest between the Advisers
and their clients, the Chairman of the Committee will initially determine what
vote to recommend that the Advisers should cast and the matter will go before
the Committee.

         A.       CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.

                  The Advisers have implemented these proxy voting procedures in
                  order to prevent conflicts of interest from influencing their
                  proxy voting decisions. By following the Proxy Guidelines, as
                  well as the recommendations of ISS, other third-party services
                  and the analysts of Gabelli & Company, the Advisers are able
                  to avoid, wherever possible, the influence of potential
                  conflicts of interest. Nevertheless, circumstances may arise
                  in which one or more of the Advisers are faced with a conflict
                  of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest in
                  connection with its vote. In general, a conflict of interest
                  may arise when an Adviser knowingly does business with an
                  issuer, and may appear to have a material conflict between its
                  own interests and the interests of the shareholders of an
                  investment company managed by one of the Advisers regarding
                  how the proxy is to be voted. A conflict also may exist when
                  an Adviser has actual knowledge of a material business
                  arrangement between an issuer and an affiliate of the Adviser.

                  In practical terms, a conflict of interest may arise, for
                  example, when a proxy is voted for a company that is a client
                  of one of the Advisers, such as GAMCO Asset Management Inc. A
                  conflict also may arise when a client of one of the Advisers
                  has made a shareholder proposal in a proxy to be voted upon by
                  one or more of the Advisers. The Director of Proxy Voting
                  Services, together with the Legal Department, will scrutinize
                  all proxies for these or other situations that may give rise
                  to a conflict of interest with respect to the voting of
                  proxies.

         B.       OPERATION OF PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

                  For matters submitted to the Committee, each member of the
                  Committee will receive, prior to the meeting, a copy of the
                  proxy statement, any relevant third party research, a summary
                  of any views provided by the Chief Investment Officer and any
                  recommendations by Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts. The Chief
                  Investment Officer or the Gabelli & Company, Inc. analysts may
                  be invited to present their viewpoints. If the Director of
                  Proxy Voting Services or the Legal Department believe that the
                  matter before the committee is one with respect to which a
                  conflict of interest may exist between the Advisers and their
                  clients, counsel will provide an opinion to the Committee
                  concerning the conflict. If the matter is one in which the
                  interests of the clients of one or more of Advisers may
                  diverge, counsel will so advise and the Committee may make
                  different recommendations as to different clients. For any
                  matters where the recommendation may trigger appraisal rights,
                  counsel will provide an opinion concerning the likely risks
                  and merits of such an appraisal action.

                                       2
<PAGE>

         Each matter submitted to the Committee will be determined by the vote
of a majority of the members present at the meeting. Should the vote concerning
one or more recommendations be tied in a vote of the Committee, the Chairman of
the Committee will cast the deciding vote. The Committee will notify the proxy
department of its decisions and the proxies will be voted accordingly.

         Although the Proxy Guidelines express the normal preferences for the
voting of any shares not covered by a contrary investment guideline provided by
the client, the Committee is not bound by the preferences set forth in the Proxy
Guidelines and will review each matter on its own merits. Written minutes of all
Proxy Voting Committee meetings will be maintained. The Advisers subscribe to
ISS, which supplies current information on companies, matters being voted on,
regulations, trends in proxy voting and information on corporate governance
issues.

         If the vote cast either by the analyst or as a result of the
deliberations of the Proxy Voting Committee runs contrary to the recommendation
of the Board of Directors of the issuer, the matter will be referred to legal
counsel to determine whether an amendment to the most recently filed Schedule
13D is appropriate.

II.      SOCIAL ISSUES AND OTHER CLIENT GUIDELINES

         If a client has provided special instructions relating to the voting of
proxies, they should be noted in the client's account file and forwarded to the
proxy department. This is the responsibility of the investment professional or
sales assistant for the client. In accordance with Department of Labor
guidelines, the Advisers' policy is to vote on behalf of ERISA accounts in the
best interest of the plan participants with regard to social issues that carry
an economic impact. Where an account is not governed by ERISA, the Advisers will
vote shares held on behalf of the client in a manner consistent with any
individual investment/voting guidelines provided by the client. Otherwise the
Advisers will abstain with respect to those shares.

III.     CLIENT RETENTION OF VOTING RIGHTS

         If a client chooses to retain the right to vote proxies or if there is
any change in voting authority, the following should be notified by the
investment professional or sales assistant for the client.

         - Operations
         - Legal Department
         - Proxy Department
         - Investment professional assigned to the account

                                       3
<PAGE>

         In the event that the Board of Directors (or a Committee thereof) of
one or more of the investment companies managed by one of the Advisers has
retained direct voting control over any security, the Proxy Voting Department
will provide each Board Member (or Committee member) with a copy of the proxy
statement together with any other relevant information including recommendations
of ISS or other third-party services.

IV.      VOTING RECORDS

         The Proxy Voting Department will retain a record of matters voted upon
by the Advisers for their clients. The Advisers will supply information on how
an account voted its proxies upon request.

         A letter is sent to the custodians for all clients for which the
Advisers have voting responsibility instructing them to forward all proxy
materials to:

                  [Adviser name]
                  Attn: Proxy Voting Department
                  One Corporate Center
                  Rye, New York 10580-1433

The sales assistant sends the letters to the custodians along with the
trading/DTC instructions. Proxy voting records will be retained in compliance
with Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act.

V.       VOTING PROCEDURES

1. Custodian banks, outside brokerage firms and clearing firms are responsible
for forwarding proxies directly to the Advisers.

Proxies are received in one of two forms:

o    Shareholder Vote Authorization Forms ("VAFs") - Issued by Broadridge
     Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") VAFs must be voted through the
     issuing institution causing a time lag. Broadridge is an outside service
     contracted by the various institutions to issue proxy materials.

o    Proxy cards which may be voted directly.

2. Upon receipt of the proxy, the number of shares each form represents is
logged into the proxy system according to security.

3. In the case of a discrepancy such as an incorrect number of shares, an
improperly signed or dated card, wrong class of security, etc., the issuing
custodian is notified by phone. A corrected proxy is requested. Any arrangements
are made to insure that a proper proxy is received in time to be voted
(overnight delivery, fax, etc.). When securities are out on loan on record date,
the custodian is requested to supply written verification.

                                       4
<PAGE>

4. Upon receipt of instructions from the proxy committee (see Administrative),
the votes are cast and recorded for each account on an individual basis.

Records have been maintained on the Proxy Edge system. The system is backed up
regularly.

Proxy Edge records include:
         Security Name and Cusip Number
         Date and Type of Meeting (Annual, Special, Contest)
         Client Name
         Adviser or Fund Account Number
         Directors' Recommendation
         How GAMCO voted for the client on each issue


5. VAFs are kept alphabetically by security. Records for the current proxy
season are located in the Proxy Voting Department office. In preparation for the
upcoming season, files are transferred to an offsite storage facility during
January/February.

6. Shareholder Vote Authorization Forms issued by Broadridge are always sent
directly to a specific individual at Broadridge.

7. If a proxy card or VAF is received too late to be voted in the conventional
matter, every attempt is made to vote on one of the following manners:

o    VAFs can be faxed to Broadridge up until the time of the meeting. This is
     followed up by mailing the original form.

o    When a solicitor has been retained, the solicitor is called. At the
     solicitor's direction, the proxy is faxed.

8. In the case of a proxy contest, records are maintained for each opposing
entity.

9. Voting in Person

a) At times it may be necessary to vote the shares in person. In this case, a
"legal proxy" is obtained in the following manner:

o     Banks and brokerage firms using the services at Broadridge:

      The back of the VAF is stamped indicating that we wish to vote in person.
The forms are then sent overnight to Broadridge. Broadridge issues individual
legal proxies and sends them back via overnight (or the Adviser can pay
messenger charges). A lead-time of at least two weeks prior to the meeting is
needed to do this. Alternatively, the procedures detailed below for banks not
using Broadridge may be implemented.

                                       5
<PAGE>

o     Banks and brokerage firms issuing proxies directly:

      The bank is called and/or faxed and a legal proxy is requested.

All legal proxies should appoint:

"REPRESENTATIVE OF [ADVISER NAME] WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION."

b) The legal proxies are given to the person attending the meeting along with
the following supplemental material:

o    A limited Power of Attorney appointing the attendee an Adviser
     representative.

o    A list of all shares being voted by custodian only. Client names and
     account numbers are not included. This list must be presented, along with
     the proxies, to the Inspectors of Elections and/or tabulator at least
     one-half hour prior to the scheduled start of the meeting. The tabulator
     must "qualify" the votes (i.e. determine if the vote have previously been
     cast, if the votes have been rescinded, etc. vote have previously been
     cast, etc.).

o    A sample ERISA and Individual contract.

o    A sample of the annual authorization to vote proxies form.

o    A copy of our most recent Schedule 13D filing (if applicable).

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES





GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT

It is the policy of GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. to vote in the best economic interests
of our clients. As we state in our Magna Carta of Shareholders Rights,
established in May 1988, we are neither FOR nor AGAINST management. We are for
shareholders.

At our first proxy committee meeting in 1989, it was decided that each proxy
statement should be evaluated on its own merits within the framework first
established by our Magna Carta of Shareholders Rights. The attached guidelines
serve to enhance that broad framework.

We do not consider any issue routine. We take into consideration all of our
research on the company, its directors, and their short and long-term goals for
the company. In cases where issues that we generally do not approve of are
combined with other issues, the negative aspects of the issues will be factored
into the evaluation of the overall proposals but will not necessitate a vote in
opposition to the overall proposals.

                                       7
<PAGE>


BOARD OF DIRECTORS


The advisers do not consider the election of the Board of Directors a routine
issue. Each slate of directors is evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Historical responsiveness to shareholders
        This may include such areas as:
        -Paying greenmail
        -Failure to adopt shareholder resolutions receiving a majority of
         shareholder votes
o    Qualifications
o    Nominating committee in place
o    Number of outside directors on the board
o    Attendance at meetings
o    Overall performance


SELECTION OF AUDITORS


In general, we support the Board of Directors' recommendation for auditors.



BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK


We oppose the issuance of blank check preferred stock.

Blank check preferred stock allows the company to issue stock and establish
dividends, voting rights, etc. without further shareholder approval.



CLASSIFIED BOARD


A classified board is one where the directors are divided into classes with
overlapping terms. A different class is elected at each annual meeting.

While a classified board promotes continuity of directors facilitating long
range planning, we feel directors should be accountable to shareholders on an
annual basis. We will look at this proposal on a case-by-case basis taking into
consideration the board's historical responsiveness to the rights of
shareholders.

                                       8
<PAGE>

Where a classified board is in place we will generally not support attempts to
change to an annually elected board.

When an annually elected board is in place, we generally will not support
attempts to classify the board.



INCREASE AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK


The request to increase the amount of outstanding shares is considered on a
case-by-case basis.

Factors taken into consideration include:

o    Future use of additional shares
        -Stock split
        -Stock option or other executive compensation plan
        -Finance growth of company/strengthen balance sheet
        -Aid in restructuring
        -Improve credit rating
        -Implement a poison pill or other takeover defense
o    Amount of stock currently authorized but not yet issued or reserved for
     stock option plans
o    Amount of additional stock to be authorized and its dilutive effect

We will support this proposal if a detailed and verifiable plan for the use of
the additional shares is contained in the proxy statement.


CONFIDENTIAL BALLOT


We support the idea that a shareholder's identity and vote should be treated
with confidentiality.

However, we look at this issue on a case-by-case basis.

In order to promote confidentiality in the voting process, we endorse the use of
independent Inspectors of Election.

                                       9
<PAGE>


CUMULATIVE VOTING


In general, we support cumulative voting.

Cumulative voting is a process by which a shareholder may multiply the number of
directors being elected by the number of shares held on record date and cast the
total number for one candidate or allocate the voting among two or more
candidates.

Where cumulative voting is in place, we will vote against any proposal to
rescind this shareholder right.

Cumulative voting may result in a minority block of stock gaining representation
on the board. When a proposal is made to institute cumulative voting, the
proposal will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While we feel that each board
member should represent all shareholders, cumulative voting provides minority
shareholders an opportunity to have their views represented.



DIRECTOR LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION


We support efforts to attract the best possible directors by limiting the
liability and increasing the indemnification of directors, except in the case of
insider dealing.


EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROXY


The SEC's rules provide for shareholder resolutions. However, the resolutions
are limited in scope and there is a 500 word limit on proponents' written
arguments. Management has no such limitations. While we support equal access to
the proxy, we would look at such variables as length of time required to
respond, percentage of ownership, etc.


FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS


Charter provisions requiring a bidder to pay all shareholders a fair price are
intended to prevent two-tier tender offers that may be abusive. Typically, these
provisions do not apply to board-approved transactions.

                                       10
<PAGE>

We support fair price provisions because we feel all shareholders should be
entitled to receive the same benefits.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.



GOLDEN PARACHUTES


Golden parachutes are severance payments to top executives who are terminated or
demoted after a takeover.

We support any proposal that would assure management of its own welfare so that
they may continue to make decisions in the best interest of the company and
shareholders even if the decision results in them losing their job. We do not,
however, support excessive golden parachutes. Therefore, each proposal will be
decided on a case-by-case basis.

NOTE: CONGRESS HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON ANY PARACHUTE THAT IS MORE THAN THREE TIMES
THE EXECUTIVE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL COMPENSATION.



ANTI-GREENMAIL PROPOSALS


We do not support greenmail. An offer extended to one shareholder should be
extended to all shareholders equally across the board.



LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHTS TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS


We support the right of shareholders to call a special meeting.


CONSIDERATION OF NONFINANCIAL EFFECTS OF A MERGER


This proposal releases the directors from only looking at the financial effects
of a merger and allows them the opportunity to consider the merger's effects on
employees, the community, and consumers.

                                       11
<PAGE>

As a fiduciary, we are obligated to vote in the best economic interests of our
clients. In general, this proposal does not allow us to do that. Therefore, we
generally cannot support this proposal.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.



MERGERS, BUYOUTS, SPIN-OFFS, RESTRUCTURINGS


Each of the above is considered on a case-by-case basis. According to the
Department of Labor, we are not required to vote for a proposal simply because
the offering price is at a premium to the current market price. We may take into
consideration the long term interests of the shareholders.



MILITARY ISSUES


Shareholder proposals regarding military production must be evaluated on a
purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients. As such, decisions will
be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients, we will vote according to
the client's direction when applicable. Where no direction has been given, we
will vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to
impose our social judgment on others.


NORTHERN IRELAND


Shareholder proposals requesting the signing of the MacBride principles for the
purpose of countering the discrimination of Catholics in hiring practices must
be evaluated on a purely economic set of criteria for our ERISA clients. As
such, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis.

In voting on this proposal for our non-ERISA clients, we will vote according to
client direction when applicable. Where no direction has been given, we will
vote in the best economic interests of our clients. It is not our duty to impose
our social judgment on others.

                                       12
<PAGE>

OPT OUT OF STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER LAW


This shareholder proposal requests that a company opt out of the coverage of the
state's takeover statutes. Example: Delaware law requires that a buyer must
acquire at least 85% of the company's stock before the buyer can exercise
control unless the board approves.

We consider this on a case-by-case basis. Our decision will be based on the
following:

o    State of Incorporation
o    Management history of responsiveness to shareholders
o    Other mitigating factors



POISON PILL


In general, we do not endorse poison pills.

In certain cases where management has a history of being responsive to the needs
of shareholders and the stock is very liquid, we will reconsider this position.



REINCORPORATION


Generally, we support reincorporation for well-defined business reasons. We
oppose reincorporation if proposed solely for the purpose of reincorporating in
a state with more stringent anti-takeover statutes that may negatively impact
the value of the stock.


STOCK OPTION PLANS


Stock option plans are an excellent way to attract, hold and motivate directors
and employees. However, each stock option plan must be evaluated on its own
merits, taking into consideration the following:

o    Dilution of voting power or earnings per share by more than 10%
o    Kind of stock to be awarded, to whom, when and how much
o    Method of payment
o    Amount of stock already authorized but not yet issued under existing stock
     option plans

                                       13
<PAGE>

SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS


Supermajority vote requirements in a company's charter or bylaws require a level
of voting approval in excess of a simple majority of the outstanding shares. In
general, we oppose supermajority-voting requirements. Supermajority requirements
often exceed the average level of shareholder participation. We support
proposals' approvals by a simple majority of the shares voting.


LIMIT SHAREHOLDERS RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT


Written consent allows shareholders to initiate and carry on a shareholder
action without having to wait until the next annual meeting or to call a special
meeting. It permits action to be taken by the written consent of the same
percentage of the shares that would be required to effect proposed action at a
shareholder meeting.

Reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

As reflected above, the Portfolio Managers manage accounts in addition to the
Trust. Actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a Portfolio
Manager also has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other accounts. These potential conflicts include:

ALLOCATION OF LIMITED TIME AND ATTENTION. As indicated above, the Portfolio
Managers manage multiple accounts. As a result, he/she will not be able to
devote all of their time to the management of the Trust. The Portfolio Managers,
therefore, may not be able to formulate as complete a strategy or identify
equally attractive investment opportunities for each of those accounts as might
be the case if he/she were to devote all of their attention to the management of
only the Trust.

ALLOCATION OF LIMITED INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. As indicated above, the
Portfolio Managers manage managed accounts with investment strategies and/or
policies that are similar to the Trust. In these cases, if the Portfolio Manager
identifies an investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple accounts,
a Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity because the
opportunity may be allocated among all or many of these accounts or other
accounts managed primarily by other Portfolio Managers of the Adviser, and their
affiliates. In addition, in the event a Portfolio Manager determines to purchase
a security for more than one account in an aggregate amount that may influence
the market price of the security, accounts that purchased or sold the security
first may receive a more favorable price than accounts that made subsequent
transactions.
<PAGE>

SELECTION OF BROKER/DEALERS. Because of Mr. Gabelli's position with the
Distributor and his indirect majority ownership interest in the Distributor, he
may have an incentive to use the Distributor to execute portfolio transactions
for a Fund.

PURSUIT OF DIFFERING STRATEGIES. At times, the Portfolio Managers may determine
that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the accounts
for which he/she exercises investment responsibility, or may decide that certain
of the funds or accounts should take differing positions with respect to a
particular security. In these cases, the Portfolio Manager may execute differing
or opposite transactions for one or more accounts which may affect the market
price of the security or the execution of the transaction, or both, to the
detriment of one or more other accounts.

VARIATION IN COMPENSATION. A conflict of interest may arise where the financial
or other benefits available to the Portfolio Manager differs among the accounts
that he/she manages. If the structure of the Adviser's management fee or the
Portfolio Manager's compensation differs among accounts (such as where certain
accounts pay higher management fees or performance-based management fees), the
Portfolio Manager may be motivated to favor certain accounts over others. The
Portfolio Manager also may be motivated to favor accounts in which they have an
investment interest, or in which the Adviser, or their affiliates have
investment interests. Similarly, the desire to maintain assets under management
or to enhance a Portfolio Manager's performance record or to derive other
rewards, financial or otherwise, could influence the Portfolio Manager in
affording preferential treatment to those accounts that could most significantly
benefit the Portfolio Manager. For example, as reflected above, if the Portfolio
Manager manages accounts which have performance fee arrangements, certain
portions of his/her compensation will depend on the achievement of performance
milestones on those accounts. The Portfolio Manager could be incented to afford
preferential treatment to those accounts and thereby be subject to a potential
conflict of interest.

The Adviser, and the Funds have adopted compliance policies and procedures that
are designed to address the various conflicts of interest that may arise for the
Adviser and their staff members. However, there is no guarantee that such
policies and procedures will be able to detect and prevent every situation in
which an actual or potential conflict may arise.

<PAGE>

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR MARIO J. GABELLI

Mr. Gabelli receives incentive-based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenues received by the Adviser for managing the Trust. Net revenues are
determined by deducting from gross investment management fees the firm's
expenses (other than Mr. Gabelli's compensation) allocable to this Trust. Five
closed-end registered investment companies (including this Trust) managed by Mr.
Gabelli have arrangements whereby the Adviser will only receive its investment
advisory fee attributable to the liquidation value of outstanding preferred
stock (and Mr. Gabelli would only receive his percentage of such advisory fee)
if certain performance levels are met. Additionally, he receives similar
incentive based variable compensation for managing other accounts within the
firm and its affiliates. This method of compensation is based on the premise
that superior long-term performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded
with higher compensation as a result of growth of assets through appreciation
and net investment activity. The level of compensation is not determined with
specific reference to the performance of any account against any specific
benchmark. One of the other registered investment companies managed by Mr.
Gabelli has a performance (fulcrum) fee arrangement for which his compensation
is adjusted up or down based on the performance of the investment company
relative to an index. Mr. Gabelli manages other accounts with performance fees.
Compensation for managing these accounts has two components. One component is
based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for managing the
account. The second component is based on absolute performance of the account,
with respect to which a percentage of such performance fee is paid to Mr.
Gabelli. As an executive officer of the Adviser's parent company, GBL, Mr.
Gabelli also receives ten percent of the net operating profits of the parent
company. He receives no base salary, no annual bonus, and no stock options.

COMPENSATION STRUCTURE FOR BARBARA G. MARCIN

The compensation of Ms. Marcin for the Trust is structured to enable the Adviser
to attract and retain highly qualified professionals in a competitive
environment. The Portfolio Manager receives a compensation package that includes
a minimum draw or base salary, equity-based incentive compensation via awards of
stock options, and incentive based variable compensation based on a percentage
of net revenue received by the Adviser for managing the Trust to the extent that
the amount exceeds a minimum level of compensation. Net revenues are determined
by deducting from gross investment management fees certain of the firm's
expenses (other than the Portfolio Managers' compensation) allocable to the
Trust (the incentive-based variable compensation for managing other accounts is
also based on a percentage of net revenues to the investment adviser for
managing the account). This method of compensation is based on the premise that
superior long-term performance in managing a portfolio should be rewarded with
higher compensation as a result of growth of assets through appreciation and net
investment activity. The level of equity-based incentive and incentive-based
variable compensation is based on an evaluation by the Adviser's parent, GBL, of
quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation criteria. This evaluation
takes into account, in a broad sense, the performance of the accounts managed by
the Portfolio Manager, but the level of compensation is not determined with
specific reference to the performance of any account against any specific
benchmark. Generally, greater consideration is given to the performance of
larger accounts and to longer term performance over smaller accounts and
short-term performance.

OWNERSHIP OF SHARES IN THE FUND

Mario Gabelli and Barbara Marcin owned over $1,000,000 and $0 - $10,000 of
shares, respectively, of the Trust as of December 31, 2008.

                      GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. AND AFFILIATES


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    JOINT CODE OF ETHICS FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
               AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF THE GABELLI FUNDS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Each affiliated registered investment company (each a
"Company") is committed to conducting business in accordance with applicable
laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business ethics, and to
full and accurate disclosure -- financial and otherwise -- in compliance with
applicable law. This Code of Ethics, applicable to each Company's Chief
Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
performing similar functions) (together, "Senior Officers"), sets forth policies
to guide you in the performance of your duties.

                  As a Senior Officer, you must comply with applicable law. You
also have a responsibility to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner.
You have leadership responsibilities that include creating a culture of high
ethical standards and a commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment
that encourages the internal reporting of compliance concerns and promptly
addressing compliance concerns.

                  This Code of Ethics recognizes that the Senior Officers are
subject to certain conflicts of interest inherent in the operation of investment
companies, because the Senior Officers currently or may in the future serve as
Senior Officers of each of the Companies, as officers or employees of the
investment advisor to the Companies or service providers thereof (the "Advisor")
and/or affiliates of the Advisor (the "Advisory Group") and as officers or
trustees/directors of other registered investment companies and unregistered
investment funds advised by the Advisory Group. This Code of Ethics also
recognizes that certain laws and regulations applicable to, and certain policies
and procedures adopted by, the Companies or the Advisory Group govern your
conduct in connection with many of the conflict of interest situations that
arise in connection with the operations of the Companies, including:

                o the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the rules and
                  regulation promulgated thereunder by the Securities and
                  Exchange Commission (the "1940 Act");

                o the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and the rules and
                  regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities and
                  Exchange Commission (the "Advisers Act");

                o the Code of Ethics adopted by each Company pursuant to Rule
                  17j-1(c) under the 1940 Act (collectively, the "Trust's 1940
                  Act Code of Ethics");

                                       1
<PAGE>

                o one or more codes of ethics adopted by the Advisory Group that
                  have been reviewed and approved by those trustees/directors
                  (the "Directors") of each Company that are not "interested
                  persons" of such Company (the "Independent Directors") within
                  the meaning of the 1940 Act (the "Advisory Group's 1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics" and, together with such Company's 1940 Act
                  Code of Ethics, the "1940 Act Codes of Ethics");

                o the policies and procedures adopted by each Company to address
                  conflict of interest situations, such as procedures under Rule
                  10f-3, Rule 17a-7 and Rule 17e-1 under the 1940 Act
                  (collectively, the "Conflict Policies"); and

                o the Advisory Group's policies and procedures to address, among
                  other things, conflict of interest situations and related
                  matters (collectively, the "Advisory Policies").

The provisions of the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act, the 1940 Act Codes of Ethics,
the Conflict Policies and the Advisory Policies are referred to herein
collectively as the "Additional Conflict Rules".

                  This Code of Ethics is different from, and is intended to
supplement, the Additional Conflict Rules. Accordingly, a violation of the
Additional Conflict Rules by a Senior Officer is hereby deemed not to be a
violation of this Code of Ethics, unless and until the Directors shall determine
that any such violation of the Additional Conflict Rules is also a violation of
this Code of Ethics.

SENIOR OFFICERS SHOULD ACT HONESTLY AND CANDIDLY

                  Each Senior Officer has a responsibility to each Company to
act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and
candid. Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

                  Each Senior Officer must:

                o act with integrity, including being honest and candid while
                  still maintaining the confidentiality of information where
                  required by law or the Additional Conflict Rules;

                o comply with the laws, rules and regulations that govern the
                  conduct of each Company's operations and report any suspected
                  violations thereof in accordance with the section below
                  entitled "Compliance With Code Of Ethics"; and

                o adhere to a high standard of business ethics.

                                       2

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  A conflict of interest for the purpose of this Code of Ethics
occurs when your private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to
interfere, with the interests of a Company.

                  Senior Officers are expected to use objective and unbiased
standards when making decisions that affect each Company, keeping in mind that
Senior Officers are subject to certain inherent conflicts of interest because
Senior Officers of a Company also are or may be officers of other Companies
and/or the Advisory Group (as a result of which it is incumbent upon you to be
familiar with and to seek to comply with the Additional Conflict Rules).

                  You are required to conduct the business of each Company in an
honest and ethical manner, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and business relationships. When making
any investment, accepting any position or benefits, participating in any
transaction or business arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates
or appears to create a conflict of interest with respect to each Company where
you are receiving a personal benefit, you should act in accordance with the
letter and spirit of this Code of Ethics.

                  If you are in doubt as to the application or interpretation of
this Code of Ethics to you as a Senior Officer of a Company, you should make
full disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances to the Chief Compliance
Officer of the Advisory Group (the "CCO") and obtain the approval of the CCO
prior to taking action.

                  Some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved by the CCO, if material, include the following:

                o the receipt of any entertainment or non-nominal gift by the
                  Senior Officer, or a member of his or her family, from any
                  company with which a Company has current or prospective
                  business dealings (other than the Advisory Group), unless such
                  entertainment or gift is business related, reasonable in cost,
                  appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
                  raise any question of impropriety;

                o any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, of any of the Companies' service providers,
                  other than the Advisory Group; or

                o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by a Company for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Senior Officer's
                  employment by the Advisory Group, such as compensation or
                  equity ownership.

                                       3

DISCLOSURES

                  It is the policy of each Company to make full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and
regulations in all reports and documents that such Company files with, or
submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission or a national securities
exchange and in all other public communications made by such Company. As a
Senior Officer, you are required to promote compliance with this policy and to
abide by such Company's standards, policies and procedures designed to promote
compliance with this policy.

                  Each Senior Officer must:
                o familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure
                  requirements applicable to each Company as well as the
                  business and financial operations of each Company; and

                o not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
                  facts about any Company to others, including to the Directors,
                  such Company's independent auditors, such Company's counsel,
                  any counsel to the Independent Directors, governmental
                  regulators or self-regulatory organizations.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

                  If you know of or suspect a violation of this Code of Ethics
or other laws, regulations, policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you
must report that information on a timely basis to the CCO or report it
anonymously by following the "whistle blower" policies adopted by the Advisory
Group from time to time. NO ONE WILL BE SUBJECT TO RETALIATION BECAUSE OF A GOOD
FAITH REPORT OF A SUSPECTED VIOLATION.

                  Each Company will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

                o the CCO will take all appropriate action to investigate any
                  actual or potential violations reported to him or her;

                o violations and potential violations will be reported to the
                  Board of Directors of each affected Company after such
                  investigation;

                o if the Board of Directors determines that a violation has
                  occurred, it will take all appropriate disciplinary or
                  preventive action; and

                o appropriate disciplinary or preventive action may include a
                  letter of censure, suspension, dismissal or, in the event of
                  criminal or other serious violations of law, notification of
                  the Securities and Exchange Commission or other appropriate
                  law enforcement authorities.

                                       4

of Ethics in any particular situation. The CCO shall take all action he or she

                  Code of Ethics; and

                o relating to any violation of this Code of Ethics and sanctions
