Annual Report
This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
World Dollar Government Fund II (the "Fund") for the annual reporting period
ended March 31, 2005. The Fund is a closed-end fund that trades under the New
York Stock Exchange symbol "AWF".


Investment Objective and Policies
This closed-end fund is designed for investors who seek high current income and,
secondarily, capital appreciation. To achieve this objective, it invests
primarily in high yielding, high risk sovereign debt and U.S. corporate
fixed-income obligations that we expect to benefit from improving economic and
credit fundamentals. For more information regarding the Fund's risks, please see
"A Word About Risk" on page 4 and "Note E-Risks Involved in Investing in the
Fund" of the Notes to Financial Statements on page 21.

Investment Results
The table on page 5 shows the Fund's performance compared to its benchmark, the
J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+), which is a standard
measure of the performance of a basket of unmanaged emerging market debt
securities, for the six- and 12-month periods ended March 31, 2005.

For the 12-month period ended March 31, 2005, the Fund performed in line with
its benchmark. Contributing positively to performance was its overweighted
exposure to Latin America. During the reporting period, the Latin region
benefited from several factors, most notably improving credit fundamentals,
strengthening currencies and export demand. Strong commodity prices,
particularly oil, also helped the economies of several Latin countries.

Offsetting this positive country selection was the Fund's security selection
which dampened its performance. The Fund was positioned too defensively relative
to U.S. interest rates. The Fund's duration was shortened during the spring and
summer of 2004, as interest rates were expected to rise and negatively impact
bond prices. A soft patch in the U.S. economy, however, delayed rate hikes by
the U.S. Federal Reserve (the "Fed") until June. As a result, the pace of
tightening, as announced by the Fed, was measured. Additionally, global
liquidity remained ample, muting the effects of rising U.S. official interest
rates. Emerging market debt, therefore, performed better than was originally
expected during the period under review.

Also detracting from the Fund's performance was an overweighted position in
Ecuador which was particularly hurt in the bond market sell-off during April and
May of 2004. Additionally, the Fund's Ecuador holdings were reduced in light of
that sell-off just prior to a rebound as a result of higher oil prices. This
further dampened the Fund's performance.

During the most recent six-month period, the Fund outperformed its benchmark due
to increased interest rate exposure, positive country selection, particularly
the Ukraine and Latin American region, and positive security selection.

Market Review and Investment Strategy
The emerging market debt class, as represented by the JPM EMBI+, posted a solid
return of 6.94% for the annual reporting period, despite market volatility at
both the beginning and end of the reporting period. Early in the reporting
period, bond markets sold off dramatically on a surprisingly strong gain in
payroll employment, sending emerging-market returns into negative territory.
Worries had surfaced that the Fed would begin tightening interest rates
sooner-than-expected. For the first two months of the period (April and May of
2004), emerging-market debt returns fell by 7.37%. By early summer, however,
investors' concerns regarding higher interest rates were eased after the Fed
signaled that it would take a measured approach to removing its exceptionally
accommodative policy stance. The Fed began to raise official rates in June at
measured 0.25% increments. By the end of the reporting period, the Fed had
raised rates a total of 1.75%.

Emerging market debt posted strong monthly returns throughout the middle of the
reporting period as early market volatility subsided. The strong gains were a
result of relatively low global interest rates, ample global liquidity, higher
commodity prices and improved economic fundamentals in emerging countries.
Between June 2004 and February 2005, emerging market debt posted an exceptional
return of 18.60%.

Late in the reporting period, market sentiment abruptly changed. Unlike the
second half of 2004 and beginning of 2005 when the market's mood had been
uncharacteristically sanguine in the context of rising rates, market sentiment
soured late in the first quarter of 2005 and bond prices fell. Fixed-income
markets were rattled primarily by two concerns: the fear that official rate
hikes could become more aggressive this year and fallout from General Motors'
profit warning. Late in the period, yields jumped after the Fed stated that
inflation pressures had increased in recent months. Inflation fears were further
stoked by sharply higher oil and commodities prices. At the end of the reporting
period, crude oil hit a new high of $57.

For the annual period, all emerging market debt countries posted positive
returns. The Latin region at 7.71% outpaced non-Latin markets at 5.80%, as
several Latin countries benefited from export demand and strong commodity
prices, particularly oil. Sustained growth in the Latin region and a resulting
decline in fiscal deficits also improved their macroeconomic fundamentals.
Countries outperforming for the annual period included Brazil at 11.56%, which
was upgraded by both Moody's Investor Services and Standard & Poor's rating
agencies, and oil producing Venezuela at 18.47% and Ecuador at 24.84%.
Underperforming for the period were South Africa at 0.74%, Mexico at 1.97% and
Colombia at 2.16%.

The Fund's allocations to its core emerging market countries (Russia, Colombia,
Ecuador, Venezuela, Mexico and Turkey) were maintained; however, the Fund's
individual country weightings were adjusted during the


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>


period. Early in the reporting period the Fund's duration exposure was reduced
which positioned the Fund for the dampening effects of higher interest rates.
The Fund generally maintained an overweighted position in Russian debt early in
the period as credit statistics continued to improve and Russia benefited from
higher oil prices. In July 2004, however, the Fund's Russian holdings were
reduced as positive economic fundamentals were offset by administrative
paralysis and the Yukos affair. Russia's Justice Ministry had seized the assets
of Yukos, the country's largest oil producer, and was preparing to sell its main
oil-producing unit in Siberia to recover payment of back taxes. Furthermore,
there was a significant negative change in Russia's sovereign supply and demand
technicals.

Additionally, the Fund's exposure in Brazil was increased as growth in Brazil
exceeded even the most optimistic forecast, easing worries about debt
sustainability. Additionally, it was anticipated that Brazilian debt would
benefit from anticipated ratings upgrades. Subsequently, Brazil was upgraded by
Moody's from a B2 to a B1 rating. The Fund's position in the Ukraine was also
increased during the period due to strong economic growth and prospects for
rating upgrades. Toward the end of the reporting period, the Fund's Argentinean
debt was also increased due to significant indications that the new, final
restructuring offer would benefit investors. Lastly, Ecuador was quite volatile
during the period and created enormous challenges. Therefore, the Fund's
exposure to Ecuador was adjusted throughout the period.

HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE


An Important Note About the Value of Historical Performance
The performance on the following page represents past performance and does not
guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the
performance information shown. Returns are annualized for periods longer than
one year. All fees and expenses related to the operation of the Fund have been
deducted. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account
for taxes.

Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II Shareholder Information
The daily net asset value of the Fund's shares is available from the Fund's
Transfer Agent by calling (800) 426-5523. The Fund also distributes its daily
net asset value to various financial publications or independent organizations
such as Lipper Inc., Morningstar, Inc. and Bloomberg. For additional shareholder
information regarding this Fund, please see page 37.

Benchmark Disclosure
The unmanaged J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+) does not
reflect fees and expenses associated with the active management of a mutual fund
portfolio. The Index is comprised of dollar-denominated restructured sovereign
bonds; a large percentage of the Index is made up of Brady bonds. Investors
cannot invest directly in an index, and its results are not indicative of the
performance for any specific investment, including the Fund.

A Word About Risk
The Fund can invest in foreign securities, including emerging markets, which may
magnify fluctuations due to changes in foreign exchange rates and the
possibility of substantial volatility due to political and economic
uncertainties in foreign countries. Price fluctuation in the Fund's portfolio
securities may be caused by changes in the general level of interest rates or
changes in bond credit quality ratings. Please note, as interest rates rise,
existing bond prices fall and can cause the value of an investment in the
Portfolio to decline. Changes in interest rates have a greater negative effect
on bonds with longer maturities than on those with shorter maturities.
Investments in the Fund are not guaranteed because of fluctuation in the net
asset value of the underlying fixed-income related investments. Similar to
direct bond ownership, bond funds have the same interest rate, inflation and
credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the Fund.
While the Fund invests principally in bonds and other fixed income securities,
in order to achieve its investment objectives, the Fund may at times use certain
types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater
than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. At the discretion of
the Fund's Adviser, the Fund may invest substantially all of its net assets in
bonds that are rated below investment grade ("junk bonds") and up to 50% in
securities that are not readily marketable.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2005

NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies
Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II (the "Fund") was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Maryland on May 20, 1993 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to
make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation
Portfolio securities are valued at their current market value determined on the
basis of market quotations or, if market quotations are not readily available or
are deemed unreliable, at "fair value" as determined in accordance with
procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's Board
of Directors.

In general, the market value of securities which are readily available and
deemed reliable are determined as follows. Securities listed on a national
securities exchange or on a foreign securities exchange are valued at the last
sale price at the close of the exchange or foreign securities exchange. If there
has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of the
closing bid and asked prices on such day. Securities listed on more than one
exchange are valued by reference to the principal exchange on which the
securities are traded; securities not listed on an exchange but traded on The
NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued in accordance with the NASDAQ
Official Closing Price; listed put or call options are valued at the last sale
price. If there has been no sale on that day, such securities will be valued at
the closing bid prices on that day; open futures contracts and options thereon
are valued using the closing settlement price or, in the absence of such a
price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are no quotations available
for the day of valuation, the last available closing settlement price is used;
securities traded in the over-the-counter market, ("OTC") (but excluding
securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of the current bid and asked
prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable sources;
U.S. Government securities and other debt instruments having 60 days or less
remaining until maturity are valued at amortized cost if their original maturity
was 60 days or less; or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st day prior
to maturity if their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days; fixed-income
securities, including mortgage backed and asset backed securities, may be valued
on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a price


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>


obtained from one or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where
broker/dealer quotes are obtained, Alliance Capital Management, L.P. (the
"Adviser") may establish procedures whereby changes in market yields or spreads
are used to adjust, on a daily basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a
security; and OTC and other derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid
price or spread from a major broker/dealer in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available (including
restricted securities) or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value.
Factors considered in making this determination may include, but are not limited
to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, analysis of the
issuer's financial statements or other available documents. In addition, the
Fund may use fair value pricing for securities primarily traded in non-U.S.
markets because, most foreign markets close well before the Fund values its
securities at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The earlier close of these foreign
markets gives rise to the possibility that significant events, including broad
market moves, may have occurred in the interim and may materially affect the
value of those securities.

2. Taxes
It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required. The Fund may be subject to taxes imposed by countries in which it
invests. Such taxes are generally based on income and/or capital gains earned or
repatriated. Taxes are accrued and applied to net investment income, net
realized gains and net unrealized appreciation/depreciation as such income
and/or gains are earned.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions
Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the date securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and losses are
determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund accretes discounts as
adjustments to interest income. Additionally, the Fund amortizes premiums on
debt securities for financial statement reporting purposes.

4. Dividends and Distributions
Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. Income and capital gains distributions are determined in accordance with
federal tax regulations and may differ from those determined in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To the extent these differences
are permanent, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based
on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary differences do not require such
reclassification.

NOTE B
Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's average weekly net assets.
Such fee is accrued daily and paid monthly.

Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser an
administrative fee at an annual rate of .15% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets. Such fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. The Adviser provides
administrative functions as well as other clerical services to the Fund and
prepares financial and regulatory reports.

The Fund entered into a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance
Global Investor Services, Inc. ("AGIS"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Adviser, whereby the Fund reimburses AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone
inquiries on behalf of the Fund. During the year ended March 31, 2005, the Fund
reimbursed to AGIS $2,100.

NOTE C
Investment Transactions
Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the year ended March 31, 2005, were as follows:

                                             Purchases          Sales
                                         ---------------   ---------------
Investment securities (excluding
   U.S. government securities).........  $ 1,196,268,537   $ 1,277,457,543
U.S. government securities.............               -0-               -0-

The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes, gross unrealized
appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap contracts) are as
follows:

Cost....................................................   $   827,499,994
                                                           ---------------
Gross unrealized appreciation...........................   $    77,742,898
Gross unrealized depreciation...........................        (4,920,415)
                                                           ---------------
Net unrealized appreciation.............................   $    72,822,483
                                                           ---------------

1. Option Transactions
For hedging and investment purposes, the Fund may purchase and write (sell) put
and call options on U.S. and foreign government securities and foreign
currencies that are traded on U.S. and foreign securities exchanges and
over-the-counter markets.

The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium
whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund bears the risk of
loss of premium and change in market value should the counterparty not


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18 o Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II


<PAGE>


Notes to Financial Statements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for in
the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities acquired through
the exercise of call options is increased by premiums paid. The proceeds from
securities sold through the exercise of put options are decreased by the
premiums paid.

When the Fund writes an option, the premium received by the Fund is recorded as
a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of the
option written. Premiums received from written options which expire unexercised
are recorded by the Fund on the expiration date as realized gains from options
written. The difference between the premium received and the amount paid on
effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is
also treated as a realized gain, or if the premium received is less than the
amount paid for the closing purchase transaction, as a realized loss. If a call
option is exercised, the premium received is added to the proceeds from the sale
of the underlying security or currency in determining whether the Fund has
realized a gain or loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium received
reduces the cost basis of the security or currency purchased by the Fund. In
writing an option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security or currency underlying the written option. Exercise of
an option written by the Fund could result in the Fund selling or buying a
security or currency at a price different from the current market value.

Transactions in written options for the year ended March 31, 2005, were as
follows:

2. Swap Agreements
The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and credit
risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates two
parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based upon or
calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a specified
amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted against each
other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II o 19


<PAGE>


Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by the
failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment to be
received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the contract.
Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each counterparty to a
swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk. Additionally, risks may arise
from unanticipated movements in interest rates or in the value of the underlying
securities.

As of April 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for interim
payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 133. The Fund accrues for the interim payments on swap
contracts on a daily basis, with the net amount recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts on the statement of assets and
liabilities. Once the interim payments are settled in cash, the net amount is
recorded as realized gain/loss on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss
recorded upon the termination of swap contracts on the statement of operations.
Prior to April 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense in the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the value of swap
contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized appreciation/
depreciation of investments.

The Fund may enter into credit default swaps. The Fund may purchase credit
protection on the referenced obligation of the credit default swap ("Buy
Contract") or provide credit protection on the referenced obligation of the
credit default swap ("Sale Contract"). A sale/(buy) in a credit default swap
provides upon the occurrence of a credit event, as defined in the swap
agreement, for the Fund to buy/(sell) from/(to) the counterparty at the notional
amount (the "Notional Amount") and receive/(deliver) the principal amount of the
referenced obligation. If a credit event occurs, the maximum payout amount for a
Sale Contract is limited to the Notional Amount of the swap contract ("Maximum
Payout Amount"). During the term of the swap agreement, the Fund receives/(pays)
semi-annual fixed payments from/(to) the respective counterparty, calculated at
the agreed upon interest rate applied to the Notional Amount. These interim
payments are recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of swap
contracts on the statement of assets and liabilities.

Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if a Fund had invested in
the referenced obligation directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general
market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the Fund is a
buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its investment. In addition, if
the Fund is a seller and a credit event occurs, the value of the referenced
obligation received by the Fund coupled with the periodic payments previously
received, may be less than the Maximum Payout Amount it pays to the buyer,
resulting in a loss to the Fund.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20 o Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II

<PAGE>


At March 31, 2005, the Fund had Sale Contracts outstanding with Maximum Payout
Amounts aggregating $48,540,000, with net unrealized appreciation of $4,574,944
and terms ranging from 5 months to 4 years, as reflected in the portfolio of
investments.

In certain circumstances, the Fund may hold Sale Contracts on the same
referenced obligation and with the same counterparty it has purchased credit
protection, which may reduce its obligation to make payments on Sale Contracts,
if a credit event occurs. The Fund had Buy Contracts outstanding with a Notional
Amount of $8,320,000 with respect to the same referenced obligations and same
counterparties of certain Sale Contracts outstanding, which reduced its
obligation to make payments on Sale Contracts to $40,220,000 as of March 31,
2005.

3. Reverse Repurchase Agreements
Under a reverse repurchase agreement, the Fund sells securities and agrees to
repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon date and price. At the time the Fund
enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it will establish a segregated
account with the custodian containing liquid assets having a value at least
equal to the repurchase price.

For the year ended March 31, 2005, the average amount of reverse repurchase
agreements outstanding was $39,908,881 and the daily weighted average interest
rate was .47%. There were no outstanding reverse repurchase agreements at March
31, 2005.

NOTE D
Capital Stock
There are 100,000,000 shares of $.01 par value common stock authorized. Of the
67,648,715 shares outstanding at March 31, 2005, the Adviser owned 7,200 shares.
During the year ended March 31, 2004, the Fund repurchased 10,201,653 shares of
its outstanding common stock for $13.02 per share pursuant to a tender offer.
The Fund incurred tender offering costs of $66,049 which were charged to
additional paid-in capital. During the years ended March 31, 2005 and 2004, the
Fund issued no shares in connection with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.

NOTE E
Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund
Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest rates
may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is the
risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty to a
derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal and/or
interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of risk for
a particular security may


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II o 21

<PAGE>


be reflected in its credit risk rating. Credit risk is greater for medium
quality and lower-rated securities. Lower-rated debt securities and similar
unrated securities (commonly known as "junk bonds") have speculative elements or
are predominantly speculative risks.

Concentration of Risk--Investing in securities of foreign companies or foreign
governments involves special risks which include changes in foreign exchange
rates and the possibility of future political and economic developments which
could adversely affect the value of such securities. Moreover, securities of
many foreign companies or foreign governments and their markets may be less
liquid and their prices more volatile than those of comparable United States
companies or of the United States government.

Indemnification Risk--In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

NOTE F
Distributions to Shareholders

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended March 31,
2005 and March 31, 2004 were as follows:

                                              2005              2004
                                         --------------   ---------------
Distributions paid from:
   Ordinary income....................   $   56,250,387   $    87,373,144
                                         --------------   ---------------
Total taxable distributions...........       56,250,387        87,373,144
                                         --------------   ---------------
Total distributions paid..............   $   56,250,387   $    87,373,144
                                         --------------   ---------------

As of March 31, 2005, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit) on a tax
basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income..........................   $     5,805,680
Accumulated capital and other losses...................       (77,680,541)(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation).................        72,351,693(b)
                                                          ---------------

Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)...................   $       476,832

(a) On March 31, 2005, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
    $77,680,541 of which $19,158,020 expires in the year 2010 and $58,522,521
    expires in the year 2011. To the extent future capital gains are offset by
    capital loss carryforwards, such gains will not be distributed. During the
    fiscal year, the fund utilized capital loss carryforwards of $49,733,626.

(b) The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
    appreciation/(depreciation) is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of
    losses on wash sales, the difference between book and tax amortization
    methods for premium and the difference between book and tax treatment of
    swap income.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22 o Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II


<PAGE>


During the current fiscal year, permanent differences, primarily due to the tax
treatment of bond premium, the tax character of paydown gains/losses and the tax
treatment of swap income, resulted in an increase in undistributed net
investment income and an increase in accumulated net realized loss on investment
transactions. This reclassification had no effect on net assets.

NOTE G
Legal Proceedings
As has been previously reported, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Office of New York Attorney General ("NYAG") have
been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry identified as "market
timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain other regulatory
authorities have also been conducting investigations into these practices within
the industry and have requested that the Adviser provide information to them.
The Adviser has been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with all of
these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but
are traded on an exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the
Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the market timing and late trading
practices that are the subject of the investigations mentioned above or the
lawsuits described below. Please see below for a description of the agreements
reached by the Adviser and the SEC and NYAG in connection with the
investigations mentioned above.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the Adviser and certain other
defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on or related to
the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG investigations
referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a party. The lawsuits
are now pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland
pursuant to a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
transferring and centralizing all of the mutual fund cases involving market and
late trading in the District of Maryland. Management of the Adviser believes
that these private lawsuits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on
the results of operations or financial condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, the Adviser confirmed that it had reached terms with the
SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is memorialized in an
Assurance of Discontinuance dated September 1, 2004 ("NYAG Order"). Among the
key provisions of these agreements are the following:

     (i)   The Adviser agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the
           "Reimbursement Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the
           adverse effects of market timing attributable to market timing
           relationships


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II o 23


<PAGE>


           described in the SEC Order. According to the SEC Order, the
           Reimbursement Fund is to be paid, in order of priority, to fund
           investors based on (i) their aliquot share of losses suffered by the
           fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate share of advisory
           fees paid by such fund during the period of such market timing;

     (ii)  The Adviser agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some
           of the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing
           January 1, 2004, for a period of at least five years; and

     (iii) The Adviser agreed to implement changes to its governance and
           compliance procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that
           the Adviser's registered investment company clients, including the
           Fund, will introduce governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the SEC
Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since the
Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced pursuant to
the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

The Adviser and approximately twelve other investment management firms were
publicly mentioned in connection with the settlement by the SEC of charges that
an unaffiliated broker/dealer violated federal securities laws relating to its
receipt of compensation for selling specific mutual funds and the disclosure of
such compensation. The SEC has indicated publicly that, among other things, it
is considering enforcement action in connection with mutual funds' disclosure of
such arrangements and in connection with the practice of considering mutual fund
sales in the direction of brokerage commissions from fund portfolio
transactions. The SEC has issued subpoenas to the Adviser, and the NASD has
issued requests for information in connection with this matter and the Adviser
has provided documents and other information to the SEC and NASD and is
cooperating fully with the investigations. On March 11, 2005, discussions
commenced with the NASD that management believes will conclude these
investigations.

On June 22, 2004, a purported class action complaint entitled Aucoin, et al. v.
Alliance Capital Management L.P., et al. ("Aucoin Complaint") was filed against
the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P., Alliance Capital
Management Corporation, AXA Financial, Inc., AllianceBernstein Investment
Research & Management, Inc., certain current and former directors of the
AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and unnamed Doe defendants. The Aucoin Complaint
names certain of the AllianceBernstein mutual funds as nominal defendants. The
Fund was not named as a nominal defendant in the Aucoin Complaint. The Aucoin
Complaint was filed in the United States District Court


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24 o Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II



<PAGE>


for the Southern District of New York by an alleged shareholder of an
AllianceBernstein mutual fund. The Aucoin Complaint alleges, among other things,
(i) that certain of the defendants improperly authorized the payment of
excessive commissions and other fees from fund assets to broker-dealers in
exchange for preferential marketing services, (ii) that certain of the
defendants misrepresented and omitted from registration statements and other
reports material facts concerning such payments, and (iii) that certain
defendants caused such conduct as control persons of other defendants. The
Aucoin Complaint asserts claims for violation of Sections 34(b), 36(b) and 48(a)
of the Investment Company Act, Sections 206 and 215 of the Advisers Act, breach
of common law fiduciary duties, and aiding and abetting breaches of common law
fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of compensatory damages
and punitive damages, rescission of their contracts with the Adviser, including
recovery of all fees paid to the Adviser pursuant to such contracts, an
accounting of all fund-related fees, commissions and soft dollar payments, and
restitution of all unlawfully or discriminatorily obtained fees and expenses.

Since June 22, 2004, numerous additional lawsuits making factual allegations
substantially similar to those in the Aucoin Complaint were filed against the
Adviser and certain other defendants, and others may be filed.

The Adviser believes that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Fund or the Adviser's ability to perform advisory services
relating to the Fund.

Financial Highlights
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) As of April 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
    interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected
    within net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however
    prior to April 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within
    interest income/expense on the statement of operations. The effect of this
    change for the year ended March 31, 2004, was to decrease net investment
    income per share by $0.06 and increase net realized and unrealized gain
    (loss) on investment transactions per share by $0.06, and decrease the
    ratios of net investment income and expenses to average net assets by 0.50%
    and 0.20%, respectively.
(b) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund has adopted the provisions of
    the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies, and
    began amortizing premium on debt securities for financial statement
    reporting purposes only. The effect of this change for the year ended March
    31, 2002 was to decrease net investment income per share by $.01, increase
    net realized and unrealized gain on investments per share by $.01, and
    decrease the ratio of net investment income to average net assets from
    12.74% to 12.69%. Per share, ratios and supplemental data for periods prior
    to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
    presentation.
(c) Based on average shares outstanding.
(d) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed, for
    purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
    Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Generally, total investment return based
    on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Total investment return calculated for
    a period of less than one year is not annualized.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II,Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Alliance
World Dollar Government Fund II, Inc., including the portfolio of investments,
as of March 31, 2005, and the related statements of operations and cash flows
for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit precedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of March 31, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian and
others. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II, Inc. at March 31, 2005, the results of
its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(unaudited)


Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names may elect to be
participants in the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
pursuant to which dividends and capital gain distributions to shareholders will
be paid in or reinvested in additional shares of the Fund. State Street Bank and
Trust Company (the "Agent") will act as agent for participants under the Plan.
Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee should
contact such broker or nominee to determine whether or how they may participate
in the Plan.

If the Board declares an income distribution or determines to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares or in cash, as holders of the Common
Stock may have elected, non-participants in the Plan will receive cash and
participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock
of the Fund valued as follows:

(i)  If the shares of Common Stock are trading at net asset value or at a
     premium above net asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue
     new shares at the greater of net asset value or 95% of the then current
     market price.

(ii) If the shares of Common Stock are trading at a discount from net asset
     value at the time of valuation, the Agent will receive the dividend or
     distribution in cash and apply it to the purchase of the Fund's shares of
     Common Stock in the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or
     elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. Such purchases will be made on
     or shortly after the payment date for such dividend or distribution and in
     no event more than 30 days after such date except where temporary
     curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with Federal
     securities laws. If, before the Agent has completed its purchases, the
     market price exceeds the net asset value of a share of Common Stock, the
     average purchase price per share paid by the Agent may exceed the net asset
     value of the Fund's shares of Common Stock, resulting in the acquisition of
     fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in shares
     issued by the Fund.

The Agent will maintain all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnish
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Agent in non-certificate form in the name of the
participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares purchased or
received pursuant to the Plan.

There will be no charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund to
satisfy the dividend reinvestment requirements. However, each participant will
pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Agent's open market purchases of shares. In each case, the cost per share of
shares purchased for each shareholder's account will be the average cost,
including brokerage commissions, of any shares purchased in the open market plus
the cost of any shares issued by the Fund.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income taxes that may be payable (or required to be
withheld) on dividends and distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to
written notice of the change sent to participants in the Plan at least 90 days
before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan may also be
amended or terminated by the Agent on at least 90 days' written notice to
participants in the Plan. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Agent at State Street Bank and Trust Company, P.O. Box 366,
Boston, Massachusetts 02101.

Since the filing of the most recent amendment to the Fund's registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there have been (i) no
material changes in the Fund's investment objectives or policies, except that
50% of the Fund's required investments in sovereign debt obligations is no
longer required to be invested in collateralized Brady Bonds, (ii) no changes to
the Fund's charter or by-laws that would delay or prevent a change of control of
the Fund, (iii) no material changes in the principal risk factors associated
with investment in the Fund, and (iv) no change in the person primarily
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio, who is Paul
J. DeNoon, a Vice President of the Fund.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant has adopted the following proxy voting policies and procedures of
its investment adviser, Alliance Capital Management L.P.



ALLIANCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT L.P.

Statement of Policies and Procedures for Proxy Voting

Introduction

As a registered investment adviser, Alliance Capital Management L.P. ("Alliance
Capital", "we" or "us") has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests
of our clients. We recognize that this duty requires us to vote client
securities in a timely manner and make voting decisions that are in the best
interests of our clients. Consistent with these obligations, we will disclose
our clients' voting records only to them and as required by mutual fund vote
disclosure regulations. In addition, the proxy committees may, after careful
consideration, choose to respond to surveys regarding past votes.

This statement is intended to comply with Rule 206(4)-6 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. It sets forth our policies and procedures for voting
proxies for our discretionary investment advisory clients, including investment
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This statement
applies to Alliance Capital's growth and value investment groups investing on
behalf of clients in both US and non-US securities.

Proxy Policies

This statement is designed to be responsive to the wide range of proxy voting
subjects that can have a significant effect on the investment value of the
securities held in our clients' accounts. These policies are not exhaustive due
to the variety of proxy voting issues that we may be required to consider.
Alliance Capital reserves the right to depart from these guidelines in order to
avoid voting decisions that we believe may be contrary to our clients' best
interests. In reviewing proxy issues, we will apply the following general
policies:

Corporate Governance: Alliance Capital's proxy voting policies recognize the
importance of good corporate governance in ensuring that management and the
board of directors fulfill their obligations to the shareholders. We favor
proposals promoting transparency and accountability within a company. We will
vote for proposals providing for equal access to the proxy materials so that
shareholders can express their views on various proxy issues. We also support
the appointment of a majority of independent directors on key committees and
separating the positions of chairman and chief executive officer.

Elections of Directors: Unless there is a proxy fight for seats on the Board or
we determine that there are other compelling reasons for withholding votes for
directors, we will vote in favor of the management proposed slate of directors.
That said, we believe that directors have a duty to respond to shareholder
actions that have received significant shareholder support. We may withhold
votes for directors that fail to act on key issues such as failure to implement
proposals to declassify boards, failure to implement a majority vote
requirement, failure to submit a rights plan to a

<PAGE>


shareholder vote or failure to act on tender offers where a majority of
shareholders have tendered their shares. In addition, we will withhold votes for
directors who fail to attend at least seventy-five percent of board meetings
within a given year without a reasonable excuse. Finally, we may withhold votes
for directors of non-U.S. issuers where there is insufficient information about
the nominees disclosed in the proxy statement.

Appointment of Auditors: Alliance Capital believes that the company remains in
the best position to choose the auditors and will generally support management's
recommendation. However, we recognize that there may be inherent conflicts when
a company's independent auditor performs substantial nonaudit related services
for the company. While we will recognize that there may be special circumstances
that could lead to high non-audit fees in some years, we would normally consider
non-audit fees in excess of 70% to be disproportionate. Therefore, we may vote
against the appointment of auditors if the fees for non-audit related services
exceed 70% of the total audit fees paid by the company or there are other
reasons to question the independence of the company's auditors.

Changes in Legal and Capital Structure: Changes in a company's charter, articles
of incorporation or by-laws are often technical and administrative in nature.
Absent a compelling reason to the contrary, Alliance Capital will cast its votes
in accordance with the company's management on such proposals. However, we will
review and analyze on a case-by-case basis any non-routine proposals that are
likely to affect the structure and operation of the company or have a material
economic effect on the company. For example, we will generally support proposals
to increase authorized common stock when it is necessary to implement a stock
split, aid in a restructuring or acquisition or provide a sufficient number of
shares for an employee savings plan, stock option or executive compensation
plan. However, a satisfactory explanation of a company's intentions must be
disclosed in the proxy statement for proposals requesting an increase of greater
than one hundred percent of the shares outstanding. We will oppose increases in
authorized common stock where there is evidence that the shares will be used to
implement a poison pill or another form of anti-takeover device, or if the
issuance of new shares could excessively dilute the value of the outstanding
shares upon issuance.

Corporate Restructurings, Mergers and Acquisitions: Alliance Capital believes
proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations are an extension of the
investment decision. Accordingly, we will analyze such proposals on a
case-by-case basis, weighing heavily the views of the research analysts that
cover the company and the investment professionals managing the portfolios in
which the stock is held.

Proposals Affecting Shareholder Rights: Alliance Capital believes that certain
fundamental rights of shareholders must be protected. We will generally vote in
favor of proposals that give shareholders a greater voice in the affairs of the
company and oppose any measure that seeks to limit those rights. However, when
analyzing such proposals we will weigh the financial impact of the proposal
against the impairment of shareholder rights.

Anti-Takeover Measures: Alliance Capital believes that measures that impede
takeovers or entrench management not only infringe on the rights of shareholders
but


<PAGE>


may also have a detrimental effect on the value of the company. We will
generally oppose proposals, regardless of whether they are advanced by
management or shareholders, the purpose or effect of which is to entrench
management or dilute shareholder ownership. Conversely, we support proposals
that would restrict or otherwise eliminate antitakeover measures that have
already been adopted by corporate issuers. For example, we will support
shareholder proposals that seek to require the company to submit a shareholder
rights plan to a shareholder vote. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals to completely redeem or eliminate such plans. Furthermore, we will
generally oppose proposals put forward by management (including blank check
preferred stock, classified boards and supermajority vote requirements) that
appear to be intended as management entrenchment mechanisms.

Executive Compensation: Alliance Capital believes that company management and
the compensation committee of the board of directors should, within reason, be
given latitude to determine the types and mix of compensation and benefit awards
offered. Whether proposed by a shareholder or management, we will review
proposals relating to executive compensation plans on a case-by-case basis to
ensure that the long-term interests of management and shareholders are properly
aligned. We will analyze the proposed plans to ensure that shareholder equity
will not be excessively diluted, the option exercise price is not below market
price on the date of grant and an acceptable number of employees are eligible to
participate in such programs. We will generally oppose plans that permit
repricing of underwater stock options without shareholder approval. Other
factors such as the company's performance and industry practice will generally
be factored into our analysis. We will support proposals to submit severance
packages that do not exceed 2.99 times the sum of an executive officer's base
salary plus bonus that are triggered by a change in control to a shareholder
vote. Finally, we will support shareholder proposals requiring companies to
expense stock options because we view them as a large corporate expense.

Social and Corporate Responsibility: Alliance Capital will review and analyze on
a case-by-case basis proposals relating to social, political and environmental
issues to determine whether they will have a financial impact on shareholder
value. We will vote against proposals that are unduly burdensome or result in
unnecessary and excessive costs to the company. We may abstain from voting on
social proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial impact on
shareholder value.

Proxy Voting Procedures

Proxy Voting Committees

Our growth and value investment groups have formed separate proxy voting
committees to establish general proxy policies for Alliance Capital and consider
specific proxy voting matters as necessary. These committees periodically review
these policies and new types of corporate governance issues, and decide how we
should vote on proposals not covered by these policies. When a proxy vote cannot
be clearly decided by an application of our stated policy, the proxy committee
will evaluate the proposal. In addition, the committees, in conjunction with the
analyst that covers the company, may contact corporate management and interested
shareholder groups and others as necessary to discuss proxy issues. Members of
the committee include senior investment

<PAGE>


personnel and representatives of the Legal and Compliance Department. The
committees may also evaluate proxies where we face a potential conflict of
interest (as discussed below). Finally, the committees monitor adherence to
these policies.

Conflicts of Interest

Alliance Capital recognizes that there may be a potential conflict of interest
when we vote a proxysolicited by an issuer whose retirement plan we manage, or
we administer, who distributes Alliance Capital sponsored mutual funds, or with
whom we or an employee has another business or personal relationship that may
affect how we vote on the issuer's proxy. Similarly, Alliance may have a
potential material conflict of interest when deciding how to vote on a proposal
sponsored or supported by a shareholder group that is a client. We believe that
centralized management of proxy voting, oversight by the proxy voting committees
and adherence to these policies ensures that proxies are voted with only our
clients' best interests in mind. That said, we have implemented additional
procedures to ensure that our votes are not the product of a material conflict
of interests, including: (i) on an annual basis, the proxy committees will take
reasonable steps to evaluate the nature of Alliance Capital's and our employees'
material business and personal relationships (and those of our affiliates) with
any company whose equity securities are held in client accounts and any client
that has sponsored or has material interest in a proposal upon which we will be
eligible to vote; (ii) requiring anyone involved in the decision making process
to disclose to the chairman of the appropriate proxy committee any potential
conflict that they are aware of (including personal relationships) and any
contact that they have had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote;
(iii) prohibiting employees involved in the decision making process or vote
administration from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to
reduce any attempted influence from interested parties; and (iv) where a
material conflict of interests exists, reviewing our proposed vote by applying a
series of objective tests and, where necessary, considering the views of a third
party research service to ensure that our voting decision is consistent with our
clients' best interests. Because under certain circumstances Alliance Capital
considers the recommendation of third party research services, the proxy
committees will take reasonable steps to verify that any third party research
service is in fact independent based on all of the relevant facts and
circumstances. This includes reviewing the third party research service's
conflict management procedures and ascertaining, among other things, whether the
third party research service (i) has the capacity and competency to adequately
analyze proxy issues; and (ii) can make such recommendations in an impartial
manner and in the best interests of our clients.

Proxies of Certain Non-US Issuers

Proxy voting in certain countries requires "share blocking." Shareholders
wishing to vote their proxies must deposit their shares shortly before the date
of the meeting (usually one-week) with a designated depositary. During this
blocking period, shares that will be voted at the meeting cannot be sold until
the meeting has taken place and the shares are returned to the clients'
custodian banks. Alliance Capital may determine that the benefit to the client
of exercising the vote does not outweigh the cost of voting, which is not being
able to transact in the shares during this period. Accordingly, if share
blocking is required we may abstain from voting those shares.


<PAGE>


In addition, voting proxies of issuers in non-US markets may give rise to a
number of administrative issues that may prevent Alliance Capital from voting
such proxies. For example, Alliance Capital may receive meeting notices without
enough time to fully consider the proxy or after the cut-off date for voting.
Other markets require Alliance Capital to provide local agents with power of
attorney prior to implementing Alliance Capital's voting instructions. Although
it is Alliance Capital's policy to seek to vote all proxies for securities held
in client accounts for which we have proxy voting authority, in the case of
non-US issuers, we vote proxies on a best efforts basis.

Proxy Voting Records

Clients may obtain information about how we voted proxies on their behalf by
contacting their Alliance Capital administrative representative. Alternatively,
clients may make a written request for proxy voting information to: Mark R.
Manley, Senior Vice President & Chief Compliance Officer, Alliance Capital
Management L.P., 1345 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10105.

COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.
