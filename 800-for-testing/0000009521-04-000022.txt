TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
December 6, 2004

The election is over. Investors can now turn their attention to the economy and
the war on terror. The economy has grown this year through strong personal
consumption and productivity growth. The 3.9% growth in the third quarter would
have been greater, but for high oil prices, sluggish business investment and the
growing trade deficit. In addition, next year's growth could be slowed by
reduced federal fiscal stimulus as the government seeks to reduce its deficit
and by the low personal savings rate. Finally, as the dollar declines in value
versus almost all other currencies (including the euro, the yen, the Mexican
peso and many others) we expect U.S. exports to pick up and imports to become
more expensive. Inflation has not been an issue because of the competition of
imported goods and the growth of productivity at a rate greater than labor
costs. This may not continue and many economists have predicted that inflation
is likely to increase. Unless oil prices spike up again we do not believe that
inflation will become a problem next year.

This last year has been one of great change. Because of the malfeasance of some,
the legislators, litigators and the regulators have put in place substantial
changes to the corporate governance of all public companies. In the end,
investors should see more ethical corporate governance from these new rules. We
have spent great time, effort and money in our effort to comply with all of
these new requirements. As investors, we are looking forward to seeing if the
requirements lead to better and more productive corporate governance.

Performance of the Fund was affected by its industry exposure. Energy companies,
led by Amerada Hess Corp. and Valero Energy Corp., provided the best performance
for the Fund as energy prices rose most of the year. Lagging industries such as
the automotive industry and the banking/savings & loan industry held back
performance. Both of these industries have been hurt by the expected rise in
interest rates and by slower than expected economic growth.

George R. Lieberman retired from the Fund's Board of Directors in October. He
served as an independent director for nearly seventeen years. In a period of
great change in corporate governance his experience, ethical drive and calm were
of great help to the Board and to management. We wish him well.

Bancroft Convertible Fund is the oldest closed-end convertible fund. Founded in
1971, the Fund's strategy has consistently been to use convertible securities as
an equity alternative to reduce risk and volatility. This strategy tends to
outperform in bear markets and lag in bull markets. The Fund underperformed the
average of its peer-group for the quarter ended October 31, 2004. Our peers
consist of the thirteen closed-end convertible funds in the LIPPER CLOSED-END
PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS survey. Of these thirteen funds, only four, including the
Fund, remain unleveraged convertible funds. In addition, we believe that many of
our competitors have greater exposure to non-convertible, low-rated, high yield
debt than we do. We believe these factors contributed to the difference in
performance between Bancroft and many of the other funds in the group.

In addition, shareholders who wish to obtain a copy of the most recent report on
the Fund issued by Standard and Poor's should contact us.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), established in 1971, is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial
statements:

(A)  SECURITY VALUATION
Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at
market using the last reported sales price as of the close of regular trading.
Unlisted securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities
for which no sales were reported, are valued at the mean between closing
reported bid and asked prices as of the close of regular trading. Securities for
which quotations are not readily available, restricted securities and other
assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by management with
the approval of the Board of Directors. Short-term debt securities with initial
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.

(B)  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INVESTMENT INCOME
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy
or sell is executed) with gain or loss on the sale of securities being
determined based upon identified cost. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, including
accretion of discounts and amortization of non-equity premium. For certain
securities, known as "contingent payment debt instruments," Federal tax
regulations require the Fund to record non-cash, "contingent" interest income in
addition to interest income actually received. Contingent interest income
amounted to 11 cents per share for the year ended October 31, 2004. In addition,
Federal tax regulations require the Fund to reclassify realized gains on
contingent payment debt instruments to interest income. At October 31, 2004
there were unrealized losses of approximately 4 cent per share on contingent
payment debt instruments.

(C)  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to distribute substantially all of its taxable income
within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore,
no provision for federal income or excise taxes is believed necessary.

The capital loss carryforward represents tax basis capital losses which may be
carried over to offset future realized capital gains. To the extent that the
carryforward is used, no capital gains distributions will be made. At October
31, 2004, the Fund had available for federal income tax purposes unused capital
losses of $4,470,204, available to offset future net capital gains, $4,045,634
of which expires in 2010 and $424,570 of which expires in 2011. The Fund
utilized net capital loss carryforwards of $3,760,644 during the year ended
October 31, 2004.

<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

(D)  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Distributions to shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the
Fund on the ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are
recorded on the ex-dividend date and paid annually. The amount and character of
income and capital gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended
October 31, 2004 and 2003 were $3,826,570 and $3,445,042, respectively, both
from ordinary income.

At October 31, 2004 the components of distributable net assets and the federal
tax cost were as follows:

        Unrealized appreciation                       $  6,074,008
        Unrealized depreciation                         (5,335,682)
                                                      ------------
        Net unrealized appreciation                        738,326

        Undistributed ordinary income                    1,037,260

        Tax basis capital loss carryforward             (4,470,204)

        Cost for federal income tax purposes          $112,450,292

(E)  MARKET RISK
It is the Fund's policy to invest at least 80% of its assets in convertible
securities. Although convertible securities do derive part of their value from
that of the securities into which they are convertible, they are not considered
derivative financial instruments. However, certain of the Fund's investments
include features which render them more sensitive to price changes in their
underlying securities. Thus they expose the Fund to greater downside risk than
traditional convertible securities, but still less than that of the underlying
common stock. The market value of those securities was $21,466,046 at October
31, 2004, representing 18.9% of net assets.

2.  MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
The management fee is paid to the investment adviser, Davis-Dinsmore Management
Company (the "Adviser"). The contract provides for payment of a monthly advisory
fee, computed at an annual rate of 3/4 of 1% of the first $100,000,000 and 1/2
of 1% of the excess over $100,000,000 of the Fund's net asset value in such
month.

The Adviser furnishes investment advice, office equipment and facilities, and
pays the salaries of all executive officers of the Fund. The Fund pays all
expenses incurred by it and not assumed by the Adviser and in addition will pay
the costs and expenses of its Treasurer's office, up to a maximum of $25,000 per
year, incurred in connection with its performance of certain services for the
Fund. These services include the valuation of securities owned by the Fund, and
the preparation of financial statements and schedules of the Fund's investments
for inclusion in certain periodic reports to the Fund's Board of Directors and
to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

3. CAPITAL STOCK
At October 31, 2004 there were 5,557,138 shares of $.01 par value common stock
outstanding, (9,000,000 shares authorized). During the years ended October 31,
2004 and 2003, 33,362 shares and 41,388 shares were issued in connection with
reinvestment of dividends from net investment income, resulting in an increase
in paid-in capital of $628,542 and $742,900 respectively.

On December 16, 2003, the Fund completed a rights offering of Common Stock to
its stockholders at the rate of one common share for each 6 rights held by
stockholders of record on November 13, 2003. The rights offering was fully
subscribed, resulting in the issuance of 797,918 common shares at a price of
$17.82, and proceeds of $14,218,899 to the Fund prior to the deduction of
offering costs. These offering costs, of approximately $169,000 ($0.04 per
share), were charged to paid-in capital in excess of par value upon completion
of the offering. The net asset value per share of the Fund's Common Stock was
reduced by approximately $0.50 per share as a result of the issuance.

4. PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY
Purchases and sales of investments, exclusive of corporate short-term notes,
aggregated $79,249,157 and $71,187,359, respectively, for the year ended October
31, 2004.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

In accordance with subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, for the year ended October 31, 2004, 12.2% of the dividends paid from
ordinary income qualified for the dividends received deduction for corporations.
Certain dividends paid by the Fund for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004
may be subject to a maximum tax rate of 15%, as provided for by the Jobs and
Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The Fund intends to designate up
to a maximum amount of $465,743 as taxed at a maximum rate of 15%.

Shareholders should not use the above information to prepare their tax returns.
Since the Fund's fiscal year is not the calendar year, another notification will
be sent with respect to calendar year 2004. Such notification, which will
reflect the amount to be used by taxpayers on their federal income tax returns,
will be made in conjunction with Form 1099 DIV and will be mailed in January
2005. Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to
the tax consequences of their investment in the Fund.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
  BANCROFT CONVERTIBLE FUND, INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.
(the "Fund") at October 31, 2004, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the
period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements and financial
highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at October 31, 2004 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND INVESTMENT AND CASH PAYMENT PLAN

The Fund has an Automatic Dividend Investment and Cash Payment Plan (the
"Plan"). Any shareholder may elect to join the Plan by sending an application to
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, P.O. Box 922, Church Street Station, NY
10269-0560 (the "Plan Agent"). You may also obtain additional information about
the Plan by calling the Plan Agent toll free at (800) 937-5449. If your shares
are held by a broker or other nominee, you should instruct the nominee to join
the Plan on your behalf. Some brokers may require that your shares be taken out
of the broker's "street name" and re-registered in your own name. Shareholders
should also contact their broker to determine whether shares acquired through
participation in the Plan can be transferred to another broker, and thereafter,
whether the shareholder can continue to participate in the Plan.

Under the Plan, all dividends and distributions are automatically invested in
additional Fund shares. Depending on the circumstances, shares may either be
issued by the Fund or acquired through open market purchases at the current
market price or net asset value, whichever is lower (but not less than 95% of
market price). When the market price is lower, the Plan Agent will combine your
dividends with those of other Plan participants and purchase shares in the
market, thereby taking advantage of the lower commissions on larger purchases.
There is no other charge for this service.

All dividends and distributions made by the Fund (including capital gain
dividends and dividends designated as qualified dividend income, which are
eligible for taxation at lower rates) remain taxable to Plan participants,
regardless of whether such dividends and distributions are reinvested in
additional shares of the Fund through open market purchases or through the
issuance of new shares. Plan participants will be treated as receiving the cash
used to purchase shares on the open market and, in the case of any dividend or
distribution made in the form of newly issued shares, will be treated as
receiving an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares as of the
reinvestment date. Accordingly, a shareholder may incur a tax liability even
though such shareholder has not received a cash distribution with which to pay
the tax.

Plan participants may also voluntarily send cash payments of $100 to $10,000 per
month to the Plan Agent, to be combined with other Plan monies, for purchase of
additional Fund shares in the open market. You pay only a bank service charge of
$1.25 per transaction, plus your proportionate share of the brokerage
commission. All shares and fractional shares purchased will be held by the Plan
Agent in your dividend reinvestment account. You may deposit with the Plan Agent
any Bancroft stock certificates you hold, for a one-time fee of $7.50.

At any time, a Plan participant may instruct the Plan Agent to liquidate all or
any portion of such Plan participant's account. To do so, a Plan participant
must deliver written notice to the Plan Agent prior to the record date of any
dividend or distribution requesting either liquidation or a stock certificate.
The Plan Agent will combine all liquidation requests it receives from Plan
participants on a particular day and will then sell shares of the Fund that are
subject to liquidation requests in the open market. The amount of proceeds a
Plan participant will receive shall be determined by the average sales price per
share, after deducting brokerage commissions, of all shares sold by the Plan
Agent for all Plan participants who have given the Plan Agent liquidation
requests.

The Plan Agent or the Fund may terminate the Plan for any reason at any time by
sending written notice addressed to Plan participant's address as shown on the
Plan Agent's records. Following the date of termination, the Plan Agent shall
send the Plan participant either the proceeds of liquidation, or a stock
certificate or certificates for the full shares held by the Plan Agent in the
Plan participant's account. Additionally, a check will be sent for the value of
any fractional interest in the Plan participant's account based on the market
price of the Fund's Common Stock on that date.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

Effective May 15, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Fund has adopted a
code of ethics that applies to the Fund's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer. See attached Exhibit EX-99.CODE ETH.

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

As of the date of this report, the Board of Directors did not have an audit
committee financial expert serving on its audit committee as the Board was still
in the process of identifying an appropriate candidate. However, the Fund's
directors subsequently elected Robert J. McMullan to the Board of Directors,
effective November 15, 2004, and have appointed Mr. McMullan to serve on the
Fund's audit committee. Mr. McMullan is an independent director. The Board of
Directors has determined that Mr. McMullan possesses the attributes required to
be considered an audit committee financial expert under applicable federal
securities laws. Mr. McMullan's background and experience will be included in
the Proxy Statement for the Fund's 2005 annual meeting, at which time
shareholders will vote to approve the election of Mr. McMullan as a director.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

Set forth in the table below are the aggregate fees billed to the Company
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") for services rendered to the Company
during the Company's last two fiscal years ended October 31, 2003 and
October 31, 2004.

  Fiscal YE      Audit        Audit-Related               All Other
 October 31      Fees           Fees (1)     Tax Fees (2)   Fees
    2003        $32,847          $0           $2,200         $0
    2004        $34,400        $9,785         $2,500         $0

(1)    "Audit-Related Fees" include those fees billed to the Company by PwC in
  connection with its review of the Company's Registration Statement on Form N-
  2 relating to the Company's Rights Offering.  All Audit-Related Fees were pre-
  approved by the Company's audit committee and no Audit-Related Fees were
  approved by the Company's audit committee pursuant to section
  2.01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X, which waives the pre-approval requirement
  for certain de minimus fees.

(2)    "Tax Fees" include those fees billed by PwC in connection with its
  review of the Company's income tax returns.  All Tax Fees were pre-approved
  by the Company's audit committee and no Tax Fees were approved by the
  Company's audit committee pursuant to section 2.01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation
  S-X, which waives the pre-approval requirement for certain de minimus fees.

Non-Audit Services

     During each of the last two fiscal years ended October 31, 2003 and
October 31, 2004, PwC did not provide any non-audit services to the Company or
Davis-Dinsmore or its affiliates or otherwise bill the Company or Davis-Dinsmore
or its affiliates for any such non-audit services.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures

     The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit
services that are proposed to be provided to the Company by its independent
auditors before they are provided to the Company.  Such pre-approval also
includes the proposed fees to be charged by the independent auditors for such
services.  The Audit Committee may delegate the pre-approval of audit and
permissible non-audit services and related fees to one or more members of the
Audit Committee who are "independent," as such term is defined in Rule 10A-
3(b)(1)(iii) under the Exchange Act.  Any such member's decision to pre-approve
audit and/or non-audit services and related fees shall be presented to the full
Audit Committee, solely for informational purposes, at their next scheduled
meeting.

     The Audit Committee also pre-approves non-audit services to be provided by
the Company's independent auditors to the Company's investment adviser if the
engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the
Company and if the Company's independent auditors are the same as, or affiliated
with, the investment adviser's auditors.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

(a) The Fund has a designated Audit Committee in accordance with
Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. The members of the Audit Committee
include:

WILLIAM A. BENTON

ELIZABETH C. BOGAN, PH.D.

DONALD M. HALSTED, JR.

George R. Lieberman was a member of the Audit Committee through October 18,
2004, on which date Mr. Lieberman retired as a director of the Fund. Mr.
Lieberman will be replaced on the Audit Committee by Robert J. McMullan.

(b) Not applicable.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


                         Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.
               Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income Fund, Inc.
                        Davis-Dinsmore Management Company
                             Proxy Voting Guidelines

                            (Adopted April 14, 2003)

These proxy voting guidelines have been adopted by the Boards of Directors of
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. and Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income
Fund, Inc. (collectively, the "Funds"), as well as by the Board of Directors of
Davis-Dinsmore Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore").

The Boards of Directors of the Funds have delegated to Davis-Dinsmore
responsibility for voting proxies received by the Funds in their capacities as
shareholders of various companies.  The Boards recognize that, due to the nature
of the Funds' investments, the Funds do not frequently receive proxies.

Davis-Dinsmore exercises its voting responsibility with the overall goal of
maximizing the value of the Funds' investments.  The portfolio managers at
Davis-Dinsmore oversee the voting policies and decisions for the Funds.
In evaluating voting issues, the portfolio managers may consider information
from many sources, including management of a company presenting a proposal,
shareholder groups, research analysts, and independent proxy research services.

Set forth below are the proxy voting guidelines:

A.   Matters Related to the Board of Directors

     1.   The Funds generally will support the election of nominees recommended
by management for election as directors.  In determining whether to support a
particular nominee, Davis-Dinsmore will consider whether the election of that
nominee will cause a company to have less than a majority of independent
directors.

     2.   The Funds generally will support proposals to de-classify boards of
directors if fewer than 66 2/3% of the directors are independent, and will
generally vote against proposals to classify boards of directors.

     3.   The Funds generally will withhold a vote in favor of a director who
has served on a committee which has approved excessive compensation arrangements
or proposed equity-based compensation plans that unduly dilute the ownership
interests of stockholders.

B.   Matters Related to Independent Auditors

     1.   The Funds generally will vote in favor of independent accountants
approved by the company.  Prior to such vote, however, Davis-Dinsmore will take
into consideration whether non-audit fees make up more than 50 to 75% of the
total fees paid by the company to the independent auditors, and the nature of
the non-audit services provided.

C.   Corporate Governance Matters

     1.   As a general rule, the Funds will vote against proposals recommended
by management of a company that are being made primarily to implement anti-
takeover measures, and will vote in favor of proposals to eliminate policies
that are primarily intended to act as anti-takeover measures.

     2.   Subject to the other provisions of these guidelines, including without
limitation provision C.1. above, the Funds generally will vote in accordance
with management's recommendations regarding routine matters, including the
following:

          a.   Fixing number of directors;

          b.   Stock splits; and

          c.   Change of state of incorporation for specific corporate purposes.

D.   Matters Related to Equity-Based Compensation Plans

     1.   The Fund generally will vote in favor of broad-based stock option
plans for executives, employees or directors which would not increase the
aggregate number of shares of stock available for grant under all currently
active plans to over 10% of the total number of shares outstanding.

     2.   The Funds generally will vote in favor of employee stock purchase
plans and employee stock ownership plans permitting purchase of company stock at
85% or more of fair market value.

E.   Contested Matters

     1.   Contested situations will be evaluated on a case by case basis by the
portfolio manager at Davis-Dinsmore principally responsible for the particular
portfolio security.

F.   Miscellaneous Matters

     1.   The Funds may in their discretion abstain from voting shares that have
been recently sold.

     2.   The Funds generally will abstain from voting on issues relating to
social and/or political responsibility.

     3.   Proposals that are not covered by the above-stated guidelines will be
evaluated on a case by case basis by the portfolio manager at Davis-Dinsmore
principally responsible for the particular portfolio security.


G.   Material Conflicts of Interest

     1.   Conflicts of interest may arise from time to time between Davis-
Dinsmore and the Funds.  Examples of conflicts of interests include:

          a.   Davis-Dinsmore may manage a pension plan, administer employee
     benefit plans, or provide services to a company whose management is
     soliciting proxies;

          b.   Davis-Dinsmore or its officers or directors may have a business
     or personal relationship with corporate directors, candidates for
     directorships, or participants in proxy contests;

          c.   Davis-Dinsmore may hold a position in a security contrary to
     shareholder interests.

     2.   If a conflict of interest arises with respect to a proxy voting
matter, the portfolio manager will promptly notify the Funds' Audit Committee
and counsel for independent directors and the proxies will be voted in
accordance with direction received from the Audit Committee.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

Not currently applicable to registrant.

ITEM 9. PURCHASE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT
COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

There were no purchases made by or on behalf of the registrant or any
"affiliated purchaser," as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act
(17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of shares or other units of any class of the
registrant's equity securities that is registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act(15 U.S.C. 781).

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

The registrant adopted Shareholder Communication Procedures (the "Procedures")
as amended effective July 22, 2004.  The Procedures are intended to set forth
the process by which shareholders of the registrant may send communications to
the Board. If a shareholder sends a recommendation of a nominee to the Board or
to an individual director, such communication would be covered by the
Procedures. Shareholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and
communications made in connection with such proposals are not subject to the
Procedures. The Registrant's Bylaws also contain provisions requiring a
shareholder to provide advance notice of his or her intention to nominate, at
the Registrant's annual meeting of shareholders, an individual for election as
director.

Pursuant to the Procedures, shareholders should send their communications to the
Shareholder Relations Group.  Communications may be sent by regular mail or
delivery service to the following address: 65 Madison Avenue, Suite 550,
Morristown, NJ 07960.  Email communications may be sent to:
info@bancroftfund.com.  All shareholder communications received by the
Shareholder Relations Group shall be promptly forwarded to the individual
director of the registrant to whom they were addressed or to the full Board, as
applicable.  Copies of all such shareholder communications will also be
distributed to the Chairs of each of the registrant's Audit Committee, and
Nominating and Administration Committee, and to counsel for the registrant and
for the independent directors.  Counsel for the registrant and for the
independent directors, upon receipt of its copy of a shareholder communication,
shall work with such Chairs and counsel for the independent directors to
determine whether such shareholder communication should be distributed to any
directors to whom it was not sent and whether and in what manner the directors
should respond to such shareholder communication.  Responses, if any, to
shareholder communications shall be coordinated by counsel for the registrant
and for the independent directors, working with the Chairs.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Conclusions of principal officers concerning controls and procedures

(a) As of December 15, 2004, an evaluation was performed under the supervision
and with the participation of the officers of Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.
(the "Registrant"), including the Principal Executive Officer ("PEO") and
Principal Financial Officer ("PFO"), to assess the effectiveness of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in
Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act").
Based on that evaluation, the Registrant's officers, including the PEO and PFO,
concluded that, as of December 15, 2004, the Registrant's disclosure controls
and procedures were reasonably designed so as to ensure: (1) that information
required to be disclosed by the Registrant on Form N-CSR and Form N-Q is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that
material information relating to the Registrant is made known to the PEO and
PFO as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no significant changes in the Registrant's internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the Registrant's second fiscal half-
year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS

(a)(1) A code of ethics, effective May 15, 2003, that applies to the Fund's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer is attached
hereto.

(a)(2) Certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer pursuant to Rule 30a-2(a) under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, are attached hereto.

(a)(3) There were no written solicitations to purchase securities under Rule
23c-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 during the period covered by the
report.

(b) Certifications of the principal executive officer and the principal
financial officer, as required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, are attached hereto.

EX-99.CODE ETH

Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc.
Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income Fund, Inc.

Code of Ethics for Principal Officers
Adopted Effective May 15, 2003

I.   Preamble
   This Code of Ethics ("Code") is adopted by the Board of Directors of
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. and Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income
Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") in accordance with Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and the code of ethics standards established in applicable rules
and regulations under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  The
Funds are adopting this Code to establish as a policy of the Funds written
standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:
1. Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
professional relationships;
2. Full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in
reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submit to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission" or "SEC") and in
other public communications made by the Funds;
3. Compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules, and
regulations;
4. The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
5. Accountability for adherence to the Code.
II.  Applicability
The provisions of this Code shall apply to all Principal Officers of
the Funds.
III. Definitions
   Principal Officer means the principal executive officer, principal
financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons
performing similar functions on behalf of the Funds regardless of whether these
individuals are employed by the Funds or by a third party, including Davis-
Dinsmore Management Company ("Davis-Dinsmore").
   Compliance Officer means the Chief Compliance Officer of the Funds or
his/her designee.
   Independent Directors means the directors of the Funds who are not
"interested persons" of the Funds, as defined in the Investment Company Act.
   Investment Company Act means the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended.
IV. Principal Officers Should Act Honestly and Candidly
   Each Principal Officer owes a duty to the Funds to act with
integrity.  Integrity requires, among other things, being honest and candid.
Deceit and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.  Each
Principal Officer must:
1. Act with integrity, including being honest and candid while
still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required
by law or the Funds' policies;
2. Observe both the form and spirit of laws and governmental rules
and regulations, accounting standards and Fund policies;
3. Adhere to a high standard of business ethics; and
4. Place the interests of the Funds before the Principal Officer's
own personal interests.
   All activities of Principal Officers should be guided by and adhere
to these fiduciary standards.
V.  Principal Officers Should Handle Actual and Apparent Conflicts of Interest
Ethically
   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Principal Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Funds.  For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Principal Officer, or a member
of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position
in the Funds.
   Certain conflicts of interest covered by this Code arise out of the
relationships between Principal Officers and the Funds that already are subject
to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The Funds' and Davis-Dinsmore's compliance
programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures.
   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Funds and Davis-Dinsmore of which the Principal
Officers are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes
that the Principal Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Funds or for Davis-Dinsmore, or for both), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions which will have different
effects on Davis-Dinsmore and the Funds.  The participation of the Principal
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Funds and Davis-Dinsmore and is consistent with the performance by the
Principal Officers of their duties as officers of the Funds and, if addressed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have been handled ethically.  In
addition, it is recognized by the Board of Directors that the Principal
Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other investment
companies covered by this or other Codes.
   Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and
the Investment Advisers Act.  In reading the following examples of conflicts
of interest under the Code, Principal Officers should keep in mind that such a
list cannot ever be exhaustive by covering every possible scenario.
It follows that the overarching principle - that the personal interest of a
Principal Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Funds - should be the guiding principle in all circumstances.
   Each Principal Officer must:
1. Avoid conflicts of interest wherever possible;
2. Handle any actual or apparent conflict of interest ethically;
3. Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by an
investment company whereby the Principal Officer would benefit
personally to the detriment of the Funds;
4. Not cause the Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for
the personal benefit of the Principal Officer rather than to benefit
such Funds;
5. Not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
made or contemplated for the Funds to profit personally, or cause
others to profit, from the market effect of such transactions;
6. Discuss any material transaction or relationship that could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest with
the Compliance Officer; and
7. Complete annually all sections of the Funds' Directors and
Officers Questionnaire pertaining to affiliations or other
relationships related to conflicts of interest.
   Types of conflict of interest situations that should be discussed
with the Compliance Officer, if material, are:
* any outside business activity that detracts from an individual's
ability to devote appropriate time and attention to his
responsibilities with the Funds;
* service as a director on the board of any public or private
company;
* the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;
* the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the
Funds have current or prospective business dealings unless such
entertainment is business- related, reasonable in cost,
appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
raise any question of impropriety;
* any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
relationship with, any of the Funds' service providers, other
than Davis-Dinsmore or any affiliated person thereof;
* a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
transaction charges or spreads paid by the Funds for effecting
portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
than an interest arising from the Principal Officer's
employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.
VI. Disclosure
   Each Principal Officer must:
1. Familiarize himself with the disclosure requirements applicable
to the Funds as well as the business and financial operations of the
Funds; and
2. Not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent,
facts about the Funds to others, whether within or outside the Funds,
including to the Funds' directors and auditors, and to governmental
regulators and self-regulatory organizations.
3. To the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility,
consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and Davis-
Dinsmore and take other appropriate steps with the goal of promoting
full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
in other public communications made by the Funds.
VII. Compliance
   It is the Funds' policy to comply with all applicable laws and
governmental rules and regulations.  It is the personal responsibility of each
Principal Officer to adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those
laws, rules and regulations.
VIII. Reporting and Accountability
            Each Principal Officer must:
1. Upon receipt of the Code, sign and submit to the Compliance
Officer an Acknowledgement stating that he or she has received, read,
and understands the Code.
2. By April 30 of each year submit an Acknowledgement Form to the
Compliance Officer confirming that he or she has received, read and
understands the Code and has complied with the requirements of the
Code as of the date of signing.
3. Not retaliate against any employee or Principal Officer for
reports of potential violations that are made in good faith; and
4. Notify the Compliance Officer promptly if he becomes aware of
any existing or potential violation of this Code.  Failure to do so
is itself a violation of this Code.
IX. Review and Enforcement Procedures
    Except as described otherwise below, the Compliance Officer is
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions
are presented to it and has the authority to interpret this Code in any
particular situation.  The following procedures apply in investigating and
enforcing this Code, and in reporting on the Code:
1. The Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to
investigate any violations reported to it;
2. Violations and potential violations will be reported to the
Audit Committee (the "Committee"), counsel to the Funds and counsel
to the Independent Directors after such investigation;
3. If the Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it
will inform the Independent Directors who will take all appropriate
disciplinary or preventive action;
4. Appropriate disciplinary or preventive action may include a
review of and appropriate modifications to applicable policies and
procedures, notification of appropriate personnel at Davis- Dinsmore,
a letter of censure, or recommendation of suspension or dismissal;
5. The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting
waivers, as appropriate; and
6. Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR as provided by SEC rules.
X. Periodic Review
   At least annually, the Principal Officers and the Compliance Officer
will prepare a written report to the Boards of Directors of the Funds
describing any issues arising under this Code or procedures, including but not
limited to, information about material violations of this Code or procedures
and any sanctions imposed in response to those material violations.
   The Boards of Directors of the Funds will review this Code on an
annual basis.
XI. Other Policies and Procedures
   The Funds' and Davis-Dinsmore's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1
under the Investment Company Act are separate documents applying to Principal
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.
XII. Amendments
   This Code may not be amended except in written form, which is
specifically approved by a majority vote of the Funds' Boards of Directors,
including a majority of independent directors.
XIII. Confidentiality
   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
shall be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly.  Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Funds, Davis-Dinsmore, the
Board of Directors, and counsel to the foregoing.
XIV. Internal Use
   The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and
does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
