To the Members and Board of Directors of
    UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of portfolio
investments,  as of December 31, 2006,  and the related  statement of operations
and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of changes in members'
capital  for each of the two years in the period  then  ended.  These  financial
statements are the responsibility of the Fund's  management.  Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the  Fund's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our  audit
included  consideration of internal control over financial  reporting as a basis
for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the Fund's
internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2006 by correspondence  with
the custodian and others or by the other appropriate  auditing  procedures where
replies  from others were not  received.  We believe  that our audits  provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. at December
31,  2006,  the results of its  operations  and its cash flows for the year then
ended and the changes in its  members'  capital for each of the two years in the
period  then  ended,  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

                                                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   ORGANIZATION

     UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the  "Fund") was  organized  as a limited  liability
     company  under the laws of  Delaware  on  September  4,  2002.  The Fund is
     registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
     Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. The
     Fund's investment  objective is to seek capital  appreciation over the long
     term. The Fund is a multi-manager  fund that seeks to achieve its objective
     by deploying  its assets  among a select  group of  portfolio  managers who
     primarily employ  long/short equity  strategies,  including those involving
     foreign  issuers.   Generally,   such  portfolio   managers  conduct  their
     investment programs through  unregistered  investment funds  (collectively,
     the "Investment  Funds"),  in which the Fund invests as a limited  partner,
     member or  shareholder  along  with  other  investors.  The Fund  commenced
     operations on February 1, 2003.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall  responsibility
     to manage and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
     exclusive  authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
     management,  conduct and  operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
     have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the "Adviser"  and, when
     providing    services    under   the    Administration    Agreement,    the
     "Administrator"),   a  Delaware  limited  liability  company,   to  provide
     investment  advice  regarding the  selection of Investment  Funds and to be
     responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Adviser is a direct  wholly owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,  Inc.,
     which is a wholly  owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG,  and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Adviser may  determine  and are  generally
     accepted monthly. The Fund reserves the right to reject any application for
     interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to
     written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors,  in their complete
     and  exclusive  discretion.  Members  can only  transfer  or  assign  their
     membership interests,  or portion thereof, (i) by operation of law pursuant
     to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency or dissolution of a Member,  or (ii)
     with the written approval of the Directors,  which may be withheld in their
     sole and absolute discretion.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
     Adviser  as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
     accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set  forth  below or as may be
     determined  from  time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
     Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to the
     terms and  conditions of the respective  operating  agreements and offering
     memoranda, as appropriate. The Fund's investments  in  Investment Funds are

                                                                               6

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     carried at fair value as  determined by the Fund's pro rata interest in the
     net  assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations  utilize  financial
     information  supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management and
     performance  incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds'
     managers  or  pursuant  to the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The Fund's
     valuation   procedures   require  the  Adviser  to  consider  all  relevant
     information  available  at the time  the Fund  values  its  portfolio.  The
     Adviser  and/or the Directors will consider such  information  and consider
     whether it is appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances, to value
     such a position  at its net asset  value as  reported  or whether to adjust
     such  value.  The  underlying  investments  of  each  Investment  Fund  are
     accounted  for at  fair  value  as  described  in  each  Investment  Fund's
     financial statements (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

     Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in the
     form of  cash or  securities,  are  first  applied  as a  reduction  of the
     investment's cost.

     B.   INCOME RECOGNITION

     Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses
     from  Investment  Fund  transactions  are calculated on the identified cost
     basis.

     C.   FUND COSTS

     The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not
     limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
     and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value;  costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  organization
     costs; due diligence,  including travel and related  expenses;  expenses of
     meetings of Directors and Members; all costs with respect to communications
     to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors. Offering
     costs are charged to capital as incurred.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
     been provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member is
     individually  required  to report on its own tax  return  its  distributive
     share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
     account  that pays money market  rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
     accrued interest, which is included in interest receivable on the Statement
     of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

                                                                               7

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     F.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

     From  time to time  the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
     connection  with  such  transactions  it is  the  Fund's  policy  that  its
     Custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities, the fair
     value of which exceeds the principal amount of the repurchase  transaction,
     including accrued interest,  at all times. If the seller defaults,  and the
     fair value of the collateral declines, realization of the collateral by the
     Fund may be delayed  or  limited.  As of  December  31,  2006 there were no
     outstanding repurchase agreements.

     G.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S.  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles requires the Manager to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
     and accompanying notes. The Manager believes that the estimates utilized in
     preparing  the Fund's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;
     however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Adviser provides  investment  advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
     an Investment Manager Agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement, the Fund pays
     the Adviser a monthly fee (the  "Investment  Management Fee") at the annual
     rate of 1.45% of the Fund's net assets,  excluding  assets  attributable to
     the Adviser  and the  Administrator.  The  Administrator  provides  certain
     administrative  services  to  the  Fund,  including,  among  other  things,
     providing office space and other support  services.  In  consideration  for
     such  services,  the  Fund  pays  the  Administrator  a  monthly  fee  (the
     "Administrator  Fee") at an annual  rate of 0.30% of the Fund's net assets,
     excluding  assets  attributable  to the  Administrator's  and the Adviser's
     capital account.  The Administrator  Fee and the Investment  Management Fee
     will be paid to the  Administrator  out of the Fund's  assets  and  debited
     against the Members' capital accounts, excluding net assets attributable to
     the  Administrator's  and the Adviser's  capital account.  A portion of the
     Investment Management Fee and the Administrator Fee is paid by UBSFA to its
     affiliates.

     UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
     Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
     compensation from the Fund, and will bear its own costs associated with its
     activities  as  placement  agent.   Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
     contributions  are debited against the contribution  amounts to arrive at a
     net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute  assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase (or decrease) in Members'  capital derived from operations
     (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of all Members on

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2006

3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     In order to achieve a more equitable  distribution of the impact of certain
     initial organization and offering costs, the Fund has either credited to or
     debited against the Members' capital accounts the sum of such initial costs
     based on each  individual  Member's  percentage of capital in the Fund. The
     reallocation  of these costs will occur for the first  twelve  months after
     the initial closing date of the Fund.

     Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a fee
     for each meeting attended. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for all
     reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed  by the Fund
     related to Directors  for the year ended  December  31, 2006 were  $26,731,
     which is included in miscellaneous expense.

     Other investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
     may also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

4.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

     PFPC Trust Company (an  affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as the custodian
     (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial services for
     the Fund.

     PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate  of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as  Accounting  and
     Investor  Servicing Agent to the Fund and in that capacity provides certain
     administrative,   accounting,   record  keeping,  tax  and  Member  related
     services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee  primarily  based upon (i) the
     average net assets of the Fund  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and (ii)
     the  aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
     sponsored or advised by UBS Americas, Inc. or its affiliates. Additionally,
     the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

5.   CREDIT FACILITY

     Effective  July 1, 2006 the Fund,  along  with other UBS  sponsored  funds,
     entered into a $200,000,000  committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit
     with Harris Trust and Savings Bank. Under the most restrictive arrangement,
     the Fund may borrow an amount that  combined  with the other  borrowings of
     the Fund  would not  exceed 20% of its net  assets.  The  Fund's  borrowing
     capacity is also limited to the portion of the unused line of credit at any
     point in time.  The Fund is only  liable  under  the line of  credit to the
     extent of its own borrowing there under. The interest rate on the borrowing
     is based on the  Federal  Funds rate plus 150 basis  points per annum.  The
     expiration  date of such credit  agreements is July 31, 2007. The committed
     facility  also  requires a fee to be paid by the Fund, on a pro rata basis,
     based on the amount of the aggregate commitment which has not been utilized
     of 25 basis  points per annum.  For the twelve  months  ended  December 31,
     2006,  the Fund's  average  interest rate paid on borrowings  was 7.20% per
     annum and the average borrowings outstanding were $7,312,500.  The Fund had
     no borrowings outstanding at year ended December 31, 2006. Interest expense
     for the year was $92,314, of which $11,259 was payable at year end.

6.   SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  Investment  Funds  for the year  ended
     December 31, 2006 amounted to $266,000,000 and $56,221,973, respectively.

                                                                               9

6.   SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the  Investment  Funds.
     The  allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by the  Investment
     Funds on Schedule  K-1.  The Fund has not yet  received  all such  Schedule
     K-1's for the year ended December 31, 2006.

7.   INVESTMENTS

     As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none
     of which were related parties.  The Fund's investments are summarized below
     based on the  investment  objectives  of the specific  Investment  Funds at
     December 31, 2006.

         INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE                COST                  FAIR VALUE
         -------------------             ------------             ------------
            Long/Short Equity            $608,000,000             $790,273,769

     The  agreements  related to  investments  in  Investment  Funds provide for
     compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of  management
     fees of  between  2% and 2.5% (per  annum) of net  assets  and  performance
     incentive  fees or  allocations  ranging  from 16.5% to 25% of net  profits
     earned.  One or more underlying fund  investments  have entered into a side
     pocket  arrangement.  Detailed  information  about  the  Investment  Funds'
     portfolios is not available.

8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
     contracts for  differences,  and equity  swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
     these  Investment  Funds is  limited to the value of these  investments  as
     reported by the Fund.

9.   INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into  contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against  the Fund.
     Based on its history and experience,  management  feels that the likelihood
     of such an event is remote.


                                                                              10

10.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     A.   FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN
          48)

     On July 13, 2006, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released
     FASB  Interpretation  No. 48 "Accounting  for  Uncertainty in Income Taxes"
     (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides  guidance for how uncertain tax positions  should
     be  recognized,   measured,   presented  and  disclosed  in  the  financial
     statements.  FIN 48  requires  the  evaluation  of tax  positions  taken or
     expected to be taken in the course of  preparing  the Fund's tax returns to
     determine  whether the tax  positions are  "more-likely-than-not"  of being
     sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet
     the  more-likely-than-not  threshold  would be recorded as a tax benefit or
     expense in the current  year.  Adoption  of FIN 48 is  required  for fiscal
     years  beginning  after  December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open
     tax years as of the effective date. At this time,  management is evaluating
     the  implications of FIN 48 and its impact on the financial  statements has
     not yet been determined.

     B.   STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157 (FAS 157)

     On September 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial  Accounting
     Standards  No.  157  "Fair  Value   Measurements"   ("FAS  157").  FAS  157
     establishes an authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework
     for  measuring  fair  value,  and  requires  additional  disclosures  about
     fair-value measurements.  The application of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
     years  beginning  after November 15, 2007 and interim  periods within those
     fiscal years.  At this time,  management is evaluating the  implications of
     FAS  157  and its  impact  on the  financial  statements  has not yet  been
     determined.

                                                                              11

                              UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.
                              RIDER FOR 2006 N-CSR
                              ---------------------

     The Directors  (including  the  Independent  Directors)  last evaluated the
Investment Management Agreement at a meeting on November 28, 2006. The Directors
met in an  executive  session  during  which  they were  advised  by and had the
opportunity  to discuss  with  independent  legal  counsel  the  approval of the
Investment Management  Agreement.  The Directors reviewed materials furnished by
the Adviser, including information regarding the Adviser, its affiliates and its
personnel, operations and financial condition. Tables indicating comparative fee
information,  and  comparative  performance  information,  as well as a  summary
financial analysis for the Fund, were also included in the meeting materials and
were reviewed and discussed. The Directors discussed with representatives of the
Adviser the Fund's  operations and the Adviser's ability to provide advisory and
other services to the Fund.

     The  Directors  reviewed,  among other  things,  the nature of the advisory
services to be provided to the Fund by the  Adviser,  including  its  investment
process,  and the  experience  of the  investment  advisory and other  personnel
proposing to provide  services to the Fund. The Directors  discussed the ability
of the Adviser to manage the Fund's  investments  in accordance  with the Fund's
stated  investment  objectives  and  policies,  as  well as the  services  to be
provided by the Adviser to the Fund,  including  administrative  and  compliance
services,  oversight  of Fund  accounting,  marketing  services,  assistance  in
meeting legal and regulatory  requirements and other services  necessary for the
operation of the Fund. The Directors  acknowledged  the Adviser's  employment of
highly skilled investment  professionals,  research analysts and administrative,
legal and  compliance  staff  members to ensure  that a high level of quality in
compliance  and  administrative  services  would be  provided  to the Fund.  The
Directors also recognized the benefits which the Fund derives from the resources
available to the Adviser and the Adviser's affiliates,  including UBS AG and UBS
Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial").  Accordingly, the Directors felt that
the quality of service offered by the Adviser to the Fund was  appropriate,  and
that the Adviser's  personnel had  sufficient  expertise to manage the Fund.

     The  Directors  reviewed  the  performance  of the Fund and  compared  that
performance to the performance of other  investment  companies  presented by UBS
Financial  which had objectives and strategies  similar to those of the Fund and
which  are  managed  by  other,  third-party  investment  advisers  ("Comparable
Funds").  The Directors  determined that the Fund's  annualized  performance was
equal to the median performance of its Comparable Funds, and above the return of
the HFRX Equity Hedge Index.  The Directors  also  acknowledged  that the Fund's
more global investment mandate may have accounted, in part, for the Fund's lower
performance  relative to the higher  performing  Comparable Funds. The Directors
also compared the  volatility of the Fund to that of its Comparable  Funds.  The
Directors  observed that the Fund's  volatility  was within the range of that of
its Comparable Funds, although it was higher than the median volatility.

<PAGE>

     The  Directors  considered  the fees being  charged by the  Adviser for its
services to the Fund as compared to those charged to the Comparable  Funds,  and
as compared to the fees charged by UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA") and its
affiliates  for other  UBS  alternative  investment  products.  The  information
presented to the Directors  showed that the  management fee being charged to the
Fund was above the median  management fee being charged to its Comparable Funds,
although less than or equal to the  management fee being charged to those of its
Comparable Funds which were registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as  amended.  The  Directors  also  noted  that the Fund was not  subject to any
incentive  fee. In comparing  the advisory fees being charged to the Fund to the
fees  being  charged  by UBSFA and its  affiliates  for  other  UBS  alternative
investment  products,  the  Directors  noted that  although the  combination  of
management fee and administrative services fee being charged to the Fund was the
highest being charged to an Alternative Investment Group fund-of-funds, the Fund
was not subject to any incentive fee. In light of the  foregoing,  the Directors
felt that the  management  fee being  charged to the Fund was  appropriate.

     The  Directors  also  considered  the  profitability  of UBSFA both  before
payment to brokers and after payment to brokers and  concluded  that the profits
to be  realized  by  UBSFA  and  its  affiliates  under  the  Fund's  Investment
Management  Agreement  and from other  relationships  between the Fund and UBSFA
were within a range the Directors  considered  reasonable and  appropriate.  The
Directors  also  discussed  the fact that the Fund was not large  enough at that
time to  support  a request  for  breakpoints  due to  economies  of scale.  The
Directors determined that the fees were reasonable. The Directors concluded that
approval of the Investment Management Agreement was in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders.

ITEM 7.   DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
          MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.

                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


A. INTRODUCTION

         UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the "Adviser")  votes proxies for each fund
(each a "Fund," collectively,  the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and
as such, has adopted these Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies
and  Procedures").  The  Funds  are  funds of funds  that  invest  primarily  in
unregistered investment vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other
than the Fund. Generally,  each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets
in non-voting  securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do
not submit matters to investors for vote; however,  should a matter be submitted
for vote and provided the Fund holds voting  interests in the  Investment  Fund,
the Adviser will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the
Fund  and in  accordance  with  these  Policies  and  Procedures.  The  Board of
Directors  (the "Board") of the Funds has adopted these  Policies and Procedures
as the Funds'. The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's
Policies and Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

         Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process.  The Adviser is under a fiduciary  duty to act in the best  interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize  shareholder  value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the  Adviser's  part to  analyze  the  issues  connected  with the  votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

         Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent  with  management's  recommendations  on  routine  matters,  absent a
particular  reason  to the  contrary.  Non-routine  matters  will be  voted on a
case-by-case  basis taking into  consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.
<PAGE>

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         Any  circumstance  or relationship  which would  compromise a portfolio
manager's  objectivity  in voting  proxies in the best  interest  of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest.  In such  situations,  the Adviser will
address any material  conflicts  before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy,  the Adviser will presume the  existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

     >>  A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment Fund
         soliciting  proxies or has  communicated  its view to the Adviser on an
         impending proxy vote;

     >>  The portfolio  manager  responsible for  proxy-voting  has identified a
         personal  interest in the Investment Fund soliciting  proxies or in the
         outcome of a shareholder vote;

     >>  Members of the  portfolio  management  team,  including  the  portfolio
         manager   responsible  for  proxy-voting,   and/or  members  of  senior
         management,   have  a  personal  interest  through  investment  in  the
         Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

     >>  Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in the
         outcome of a shareholder  vote have  attempted to influence  either the
         Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.


            Employees  of the  Adviser  should  be  aware of the  potential  for
conflicts  of  interest  that  may  result,  on the  part of the  Adviser,  from
employees'  personal  relationships or special  circumstances that may result as
part of the Adviser's  normal course of business.  Employees who become aware of
any such  conflicts  of  interest  are  under  obligation  to bring  them to the
attention  of  the  Chief  Compliance  Officer  or  Legal  who  will  work  with
appropriate  personnel  of the  Adviser  to  determine  the  materiality  of the
conflict.

                  ADDRESSING  MATERIAL  CONFLICTS  OF  INTEREST.  A conflict  of
interest  will be considered  material to the extent it is determined  that such
conflict has the  potential to influence the  Adviser's  decision-making  in the
proxy-voting process and the determination will be based on an assessment of the
particular facts and circumstances.

            If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the
Adviser may vote proxies  notwithstanding  the  existence of the  conflict.  The
Adviser shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified,
the  materiality  determination,  and the method  used to resolve  the  material
conflict of interest.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate  personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution  before  voting  proxies  affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

     >>  Disclosing  the conflict and  obtaining  consent  before  voting (which
         consent  in the case of the  Fund(s)  may be  obtained  from the Fund's
         board of directors);
<PAGE>

     >>  Engaging  another  party on behalf of the  Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
         its behalf;

     >>  Engaging a third party to  recommend  a vote with  respect to the proxy
         based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

     >>  Such  other  method as is deemed  appropriate  under the  circumstances
         given the nature of the conflict.


E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

         The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect
to the Fund(s)  during the preceding  twelve-month  period ended June 30 on Form
N-PX, no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

         Where the Funds hold voting  rights,  the Funds shall  include in their
Form N-CSR (Certified  Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies
and  Procedures;  (ii) a statement  that a  description  of these  Policies  and
Procedures  is available  without  charge,  upon request by taking the specified
action;  and (iii) a statement that information  regarding how the Adviser voted
proxies  relating  to the Funds  during  the most  recent  12-month  period,  is
available upon request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription  document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting  rights,  the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

         The  Adviser  shall   maintain  the  following   records   relating  to
proxy-voting  in an  easily  accessible  place for a period of not less than six
years from the end of the fiscal  year  during  which the last entry was made on
such record, the first two years on-site:

     >>  A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

     >>  A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

     >>  A copy of each proxy  solicitation  (including  proxy  statements)  and
         related materials with regard to each vote;

     >>  A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution of
         conflicts of interest;
<PAGE>

     >>  A copy of any  document  created by the Adviser  that was material to a
         proxy  -voting  decision  or  that  memorialized  the  basis  for  that
         decision; and

     >>  A copy of each  written  investor  request for  information  on how the
         Adviser  voted  proxies  on  behalf of the  Fund(s),  and a copy of any
         written  response  from the Adviser to any  (written or oral)  investor
         request for  information  on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of
         the Fund(s).


ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                               UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

         The Fund is managed by a  portfolio  management  team,  each  member of
which (each, a "Portfolio  Manager" and together,  the "Portfolio  Managers") is
responsible  for the day-to-day  management of the Fund's  portfolio.  Norman E.
Sienko,  Jr., the lead member of the  portfolio  management  team,  is primarily
responsible  for  the  selection  of the  Fund's  investments,  and  is  jointly
responsible  for the  allocation  of the Fund's assets among  Investment  Funds.
Kevin Hite and Mark Hansen, the other members of the portfolio  management team,
are  jointly  and  primarily  responsible  for  the  allocation  of  the  Fund's
investments.

         Mr. Sienko has served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since February
2003, and as head of the Adviser's portfolio  management group since 1998. Prior
thereto,  Mr. Sienko served from 1996 to 1997 as Product Manager,  and from 1997
to 1998 as a Fund Manager in the UBS Financial Services  Alternative  Investment
Group. He is also currently an Executive Director of UBS Financial Services. Mr.
Hite has been  associated  with the Fund  since  February  2003 and  joined  the
portfolio management team in 2005. Mr. Hite has been associated with the Adviser
since 1999 and is also a Vice  President of UBS Financial  Services.  Mr. Hansen
has been  associated  with the Fund since February 2003 and joined the portfolio
management  team in 2005. Mr. Hansen has been  associated with the Adviser since
2001 and is also an Assistant Vice President of UBS Financial Services.

         The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including  registered  closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

         Potential  conflicts  of interest  may arise  because of the  Portfolio
Managers' management of the Fund and other accounts.  For example,  conflicts of
interest may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation
of limited  investment  opportunities.  Allocations of investment  opportunities
generally  could raise a  potential  conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio  Managers  may have an  incentive  to  allocate  investments  that are
expected to increase in value to  preferred  accounts.  Conversely,  a Portfolio
Manager  could favor one account  over  another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem  investments  are placed.  The Portfolio  Managers may be
perceived  to have a conflict of  interest if there are a large  number of other
accounts,  in  addition  to the Fund,  that they are  managing  on behalf of the
Adviser.  In  addition,  each  Portfolio  Manager  could be  viewed  as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more  Portfolio  Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio  Managers'  overall  responsibilities  to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

         Other  accounts may have  investment  objectives,  strategies and risks
that differ from those of the Fund.  For these or other  reasons,  the Portfolio
Managers may purchase different investments for the
<PAGE>

Fund and the other accounts,  and the  performance of investments  purchased for
the Fund may vary from the  performance of the  investments  purchased for other
accounts.  The  Portfolio  Managers  may place  transactions  on behalf of other
accounts that are directly or indirectly  contrary to investment  decisions made
for the Fund,  which  could have the  potential  to  adversely  impact the Fund,
depending on market conditions.

         A  potential  conflict  of  interest  may be  perceived  if the Adviser
receives a  performance-based  advisory  fee as to one account but not  another,
because a Portfolio  Manager may favor the  account  subject to the  performance
fee,  whether or not the  performance  of that account  directly  determines the
Portfolio Manager's compensation.

         The Adviser's  goal is to provide high quality  investment  services to
all of its clients,  while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients
fairly.  The  Adviser  has  adopted and  implemented  policies  and  procedures,
including  brokerage  and trade  allocation  policies  and  procedures,  that it
believes address the conflicts  associated with managing  multiple  accounts for
multiple  clients.  In  addition,  the  Adviser  monitors  a  variety  of areas,
including  compliance with Fund guidelines.  Furthermore,  senior investment and
business personnel at UBS Financial Services periodically review the performance
of the Portfolio Managers.

         The Portfolio Managers'  compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed
salary  and a  discretionary  bonus  paid  by  UBS  Financial  Services  or  its
affiliates and not by the Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid
in shares of stock or stock  options of UBS AG, the ultimate  parent  company of
the  Adviser,  subject to certain  vesting  periods.  The amount of a  Portfolio
Manager's  discretionary  bonus,  and the  portion to be paid in shares or stock
options of UBS AG, is determined by senior  officers of UBS Financial  Services.
In general,  the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination  of factors,
none of which is necessarily  weighted more than any other factor. These factors
may  include:  the  overall  performance  of  UBS  Financial  Services  and  its
Alternative   Investment   Group;  the  overall   performance  of  UBS  AG;  the
profitability to UBS Financial  Services derived from the management of the Fund
and the other accounts managed by the Alternative Investment Group; the absolute
performance  of the  Fund  and  such  other  accounts  for the  preceding  year;
contributions by the Portfolio  Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative
Investment  Group;  participation  by  the  Portfolio  Manager  in  training  of
personnel;  and support by the Portfolio  Manager  generally to colleagues.  The
bonus is not based on a precise formula, benchmark or other metric.

         The  following  table  lists the  number  and  types of other  accounts
advised by the Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management
in those accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
