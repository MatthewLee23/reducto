LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                   July 28, 2004

   Dear Shareholder,

   So far in 2004, the German equity market has been one of the beneficiaries of
global economic  growth,  which gave a boost to German exports;  exports rose by
more than 4% in the  first  quarter  of 2004.  The  current  global  upswing  is
characterized  by strong demand for capital  goods,  which make up a much larger
share of  German  exports  than  those  of the  country's  surrounding  Euroland
neighbors.  Furthermore,  German  companies have  considerably  increased  their
competitiveness  due to a moderate wage policy and cutbacks in  employment  over
the last few  years.  However,  strong  export  growth has not yet led to higher
employment  and  higher  domestic   demand.   But  large  German  companies  are
increasingly less dependent on the domestic economy. Even classic domestic plays
such as retail and utilities generate an increasing proportion of their revenues
abroad.  Year to date,  the German  economy made modest  progress in its gradual
recovery.  In the second quarter of 2004,  German gross  domestic  product (GDP)
rose 2% on an annualized basis, despite disappointing  domestic growth. In June,
investor  confidence rose for the first time in six months and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its forecast for Germany's economic growth in 2004 to
1.8% from 1.6%.* It also revised its  forecast of  Germany's  GDP to about 2% in
2005.*

   After a weak first  quarter,  the German  markets  held up well in the second
quarter, with the DAX increasing in strength relative to its peers.

   For the six months ended June 30, 2004,  the net asset value per share of The
Germany Fund declined 4.0%, and its share price decreased 6.0%, while the fund's
benchmark, the DAX, decreased by 1.3% in US dollar terms during the same period.
Past  performance is no guarantee of future  results.  Please see page 2 for the
fund's standardized performance as of June 30, 2004.

   The fund's  underperformance  relative to its  benchmark  stems  largely from
overweight  positions  in  Deutsche  Lufthansa  and  Infineon  Technologies.  In
addition to the burden of the high oil price,  Deutsche  Lufthansa's  unexpected
announcement of a capital increase was not received well by the market,  and the
stock  price  declined   during  the  second  quarter.   Infineon   Technologies
underperformed  the DAX  over  the  same  period,  despite  the  fact  that  its
second-quarter results beat analysts' estimates.

   Contributors to performance included select utilities, which were not only in
favor due to increased market interest in traditionally  defensive sectors,  but
also because many companies were able to pass on higher  electricity prices more
quickly than  expected and  therefore  beat market  expectations.  In the second
quarter,  we increased  our  position in the sector by adding to our  overweight
position in E.ON.  Additional  contributions  came from BASF and Bayer;  after a
disappointing  first-quarter  performance from chemicals  companies such as BASF
and Bayer, both companies  outperformed the DAX in the second quarter due to the
improvement in the economy.  Also, the German  automotive  supplier  Continental
once more beat market estimates and the stock continued its strong  performance;
its  overweight  position in the second  quarter  contributed  positively to the
fund's performance.

   The Germany Fund continued its  open-market  purchases of its shares,  buying
518,250 shares during the first six months of 2004.  The fund's  discount to its
net asset value averaged 11.96% during this period.

   At its April 23, 2004 Board Meeting, the Board of Directors elected Sandra M.
Schaufler as new Chief Investment Officer of your Fund. Located in New York, Ms.
Schaufler will be working closely with the Fund's investment  adviser,  Deutsche
Asset  Management  International  GmbH in Frankfurt.  At its July 12, 2004 Board
Meeting, the Board of Directors elected Julian Sluyters as the new President and
Chief Executive Officer of your Fund.

lead to higher investments and employment and will eventually stimulate domestic
consumption.

Sincerely,

(a) Total investment returns reflect changes in net asset value per share during
each period and assume that  dividend and capital gains  distributions,  if any,
were reinvested. These percentages are not an indication of the performance of a
shareholder's investment in the Fund based on market price.

* DAX IS A TOTAL RATE OF RETURN  INDEX OF 30  SELECTED  GERMAN  BLUE CHIP STOCKS
TRADED  ON  THE  FRANKFURT  STOCK  EXCHANGE.  INDEX  RETURNS  ASSUME  REINVESTED
DIVIDENDS AND, UNLIKE FUND RETURNS,  DO NOT REFLECT ANY FEES OR EXPENSES.  IT IS
NOT POSSIBLE TO INVEST DIRECTLY IN AN INDEX.

Investments in funds involve risk including the loss of principal.

This Fund is not diversified  and primarily  focuses its investments in Germany,
thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in that country.  Investing
in foreign securities presents certain unique risks not associated with domestic
investments, such as currency fluctuation and political and economic changes and
market risks. This may result in greater share price volatility.

Shares of closed-end  funds  frequently  trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors,  several of
which are beyond the control of the Fund.  Therefore,  the Fund  cannot  predict
whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   QUESTION:   In  2002,   the  capital   gains  tax   exemption  for  corporate
shareholdings  went into effect,  but it has gained  momentum only over the last
year.  Will you give us an update on the recent  restructuring  activity and its
impact on the German equity market?

   ANSWER: The capital gains tax exemption for corporate  shareholdings proposed
in December 1999, approved in July 2000, and effective since 1 January 2002, was
expected  to   significantly   reduce   corporate   shareholdings   in  Germany.
Unfortunately, the decline in equity markets until early 2003 resulted in little
demand for any placements of shares on the equity market.  The depressed  market
also significantly reduced unrealized capital gains and thereby the incentive to
sell. The disposal process therefore proceeded slowly until mid-2003.  Following
the start of the equity  market  rebound in March 2003,  investors  first had to
digest  several  rights issues aimed at  balance-sheet  repair.  As share prices
rose,  the readiness of stake owners to sell their holdings also  increased.  In
late 2003 and early 2004,  with the equity market more  positive,  there finally
was scope for the placement of corporate  stakes.  The latest example is that of
RWE disposing of its stakes in Hochtief and HeidelbergCement.  Among financials,
the  disentanglement  of  the  closely  meshed  web of  corporate  shareholdings
continued.   German   corporations   have  made  progress  in  unwinding   cross
shareholdings over the past three to four years.

   QUESTION:  Germany has shown strong export growth figures during the last few
quarters.  However,  this rise did not  translate  into higher  employment  or a
strengthening of domestic demand. Is strong export growth less of a stimulus for
the domestic economy than it was in earlier cycles?

   ANSWER:  Germany was the largest  exporter  worldwide in 2003 (in USD terms),
followed by the United  States,  Japan and China.  While much of the increase is
due to the euro  appreciation,  it shows as well that German  companies can hold
their own in international competition.  In contrast to earlier cycles, however,
strong export growth has not yet led to higher  employment  and higher  domestic
demand. This raises the question of whether the lack of the traditional positive
spillover  effect of  increased  exports  (then  boosting the economy) is due to
permanent  structural  changes or whether it is a temporary  phenomenon.  German
products' strong  competitiveness  abroad is at least in part due to outsourcing
abroad.  Since 2000,  direct  investment worth 114 billion euro has gone abroad.
The proportion  destined for Central and Eastern Europe rose to more than 20% in
2003.  This means that part of the German  value-creation  chain was  outsourced
abroad  in order to  maintain  and  increase  international  competitiveness  by
cutting labor costs.

   QUESTION:  At the beginning of July, two events took place that were intended
to positively influence the German economy but angered German labor unions. Will
you discuss these developments?

   ANSWER:  First, at the beginning of July, Germany's upper house of parliament
passed a law  reducing  long-term  jobless  benefits,  which will take effect in
January  2005.  This marks the first  reduction in benefits  since World War II,
saving the  government  an estimated  2.5 billion  euro per year.  Under the new
rules for long-term employment benefits,  claimants will have to draw on private
wealth,  retirement  savings  and  property  owned by a spouse  before  becoming
eligible for state  benefits.  With more than 2.5 million  long-term  unemployed
people currently in Germany, the government's welfare rolls have become bloated.
According to the German  Economics and Labor minister,  Wolfgang  Clement,  this
reform will help to move  jobless  people  more  efficiently  and  swiftly  into
employment. Second, Siemens and IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union, agreed
recently to  reintroduce  the  40-hour  work week (from 35 hours) in two Siemens
plants without extra pay. Industry media suggests that if this agreement had not
been reached, Siemens would probably have moved many of the jobs to Hungary. The
longer work hours at Siemens are  actually  equivalent  to a 12.5% cut in hourly
wages  for the  employees,  which  shows the  extent to which the trade  unions'
negotiating  power has eroded.  Trade unions lack the means to prevent companies
from moving jobs abroad,  and fears of unemployment have weakened union members'
willingness  to fight.  German  companies  are  trying to slash  labor  costs or
increase   output  per  employee  in  order  to  weather  strong   international
competition.  Overall, the longer working hours without extra pay as well as the
reduction in welfare benefits are a favorable development for Germany.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
   Thus far in 2004,  the German  economy  made  modest  progress in its gradual
recovery.  Second quarter real gross domestic  product,  or GDP,  expanded at an
annualized  rate of 2%. This was the strongest rate of growth in three years and
was  exclusively  driven by net exports.  As world trade picked up  considerably
over the last few quarters,  demand for German exports increased. In particular,
the share of German  exports to Eastern  Europe  amounted to almost 14% of total
exports--a  significant  component  of  global  demand.   Additionally,   strong
worldwide demand for capital goods also benefited  German exports.  According to
countless  industry studies referenced  recently in the media,  German companies
significantly  increased their imports of intermediate goods used for exports in
order to keep a lid on wage costs.  Thus,  the link between  German  exports and
domestic demand has become weaker than in previous years.

   The fiscal situation looks set to remain  difficult.  In fact, in our opinion
the German  budget  deficit is likely to stay above 3% of GDP both this year and
next, so Germany could violate the Stability and Growth Pact for the fourth year
in a row in 2005. While the structural deficit will probably be reduced,  in our
view, the growth environment could remain too weak for a significant increase in
tax revenues. As a result, the government might have to cut subsidies further to
rescue the budget deficit in the next few years, as Germany has agreed to reduce
its  deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2005 at the  latest.  High oil prices and the
increase in indirect taxes led to a pronounced  acceleration in German inflation
in the last few months to 1.8%. However,  the domestically driven price trend is
still subdued.  In 2005, the significant output gap, moderate wage increases and
a strong euro could, in our opinion,  lead to a reduction in the German Consumer
price Index.  After having  toyed with the idea of lowering  rates  earlier this
year, the European  Central Bank is now taking a strictly  neutral stance due to
the clearer signs that recovery is under way.

THE GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JUNE 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Germany  Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated  in Delaware on April 8,
1986 as a diversified,  closed-end  management  investment  company.  Investment
operations  commenced on July 23, 1986. The Fund  reincorporated  in Maryland on
August 29, 1990 and on October 16, 1996 the Fund changed from a diversified to a
non-diversified company.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.   Actual  results  could  differ  from  those  estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

LOANS OF PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES:  The Fund may lend portfolio securities while it
continues  to earn  dividends  on such  securities  loaned.  The market value of
government securities received as collateral is required to be at least equal to
105  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  securities   loaned,   which  are
marked-to-market daily. Securities lending fees, net of rebates and agency fees,
are  earned  by the Fund  and are  identified  separately  in the  Statement  of
Operations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and liabilities  denominated in euros and other foreign  currency amounts
are  translated  into United States  dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the
buying and selling  spot rates  quoted by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.
Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income and expenses are reported
at the rate of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.
The  resultant  gains and losses  arising from exchange  rate  fluctuations  are
identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,  except for such amounts
attributable  to  investments  which are included in net realized and unrealized
gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.

CONTINGENCIES:  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund may  enter  into
contracts  that  contain a variety  of  representations  which  provide  general
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown as this would  involve  future  claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred.  However, based on experience,  the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to distribute all of its
taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

At  December  31,  2003,  the  Fund's   components  of  distributable   earnings
(accumulated losses) on a tax-basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income* ........ $    532,828
Capital loss carryforward ............. $(53,510,000)
Net unrealized  appreciation .......... $ 28,711,087

*For tax purposes short-term capital gains are considered ordinary income.

policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to

  ++  Total investment return based on market value is calculated assuming that
      shares of the Fund's common stock were purchased at the closing market
      price as of the beginning of the year, dividends, capital gains and other
      distributions were reinvested as provided for in the Fund's dividend
      reinvestment plan and then sold at the closing market price per share on
      the last day of the year. The computation does not reflect any sales
      commission investors may incur in purchasing or selling shares of the
      Fund. The total investment return based on the net asset value is
      similarly computed except that the Fund's net asset value is substituted
      for the closing market value.
   *  The custody credits are attributable to interest earned on U.S. cash
      balances. The ratio of total expenses after custody credits to average net
      assets are 1.45%, 1.77%, 1.63%, 1.46%, 1.27% and 1.25% for 2004, 2003,
      2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
  **  Annualized.
 ***  Not Annualized.
****  Not Annualized. The ratio for six months ended June 30, 2004 has not been
      annualized since the Fund believes it would not be appropriate because the
      Fund's dividend income is not earned ratably throughout the fiscal year.
