            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC:


We have  audited  the  accompanying  statement  of  assets  and  liabilities  of
Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC (the
Company),  including the schedule of investments,  as of March 31, 2009, and the
related  statement  of  operations  and cash flows for the year then ended,  the
statements  of changes  in  shareholders'  capital  for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended,  and the financial  highlights for each of the years
in the five-year  period then ended.  These  financial  statements and financial
highlights   are  the   responsibility   of  the   Company's   management.   Our
responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on these  financial  statements  and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included verification of
investments owned as of March 31, 2009, by inspection of investment subscription
documents and  confirmation  with  underlying  investment  funds.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by  management,   as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall   financial   statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of
Citigroup Alternative Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC as of
March 31, 2009,  the results of its  operations and cash flows for the year then
ended,  the  changes in its  shareholders'  capital for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended,  and the financial  highlights for each of the years
in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with U.S.  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2009
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.   ORGANIZATION

          Citigroup Alternative Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
          LLC (the  "Company")  was  organized as a Delaware  Limited  Liability
          Company on August  16,  2002.  The  Company  is  registered  under the
          Investment  Company  Act of 1940 (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a
          closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company
          is also registered under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").

          The  investment  objective  of  the  Company  is  to  achieve  capital
          appreciation   principally   through  investing  in  investment  funds
          ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by  third-party   investment  managers
          ("Investment   Managers")   that  employ  a  variety  of   alternative
          investment  strategies.  These investment  strategies allow Investment
          Managers the  flexibility  to use leverage or short-side  positions to
          take advantage of perceived  inefficiencies across the global markets,
          often  referred to as  "alternative"  strategies.  Because  Investment
          Funds following alternative  investment strategies are often described
          as hedge funds, the investment program of the Company can be described
          as a fund of hedge funds.

          Shares  of the  Company  ("Shares")  are  sold to  eligible  investors
          (referred to as "Shareholders"). The minimum initial investment in the
          Company  from each  Shareholder  is $25,000;  the  minimum  additional
          investment is $10,000.

          Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or the  "Adviser"),  a
          Delaware  limited  liability  company and an  indirect,  wholly  owned
          subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as the  Company's  investment
          adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the
          Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and, among other things,
          is responsible  for the allocation of the Company's  assets to various
          Investment Funds. Under the Company's governing documents, the Company
          has delegated substantially all authority to oversee the management of
          the operations and assets of the Company to the Board of Directors.

     2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms of the
          respective limited partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
          agreements,  offering  memoranda and such negotiated  "side letter" or
          similar  arrangements  as the Adviser may have  entered  into with the
          Investment  Fund on behalf of the  Company.  The Company  values these
          investments at fair value.

          A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

          The net asset  value of the Company is  determined  as of the close of
          business  at the end of each month in  accordance  with the  valuation
          principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to time
          pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2009 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The  Company's  investments  in  Investment  Funds are carried at fair
          value as  determined  by the  Company's  pro-rata  interest in the net
          assets of each Investment Fund.

          All  valuations  utilize  financial   information   supplied  by  each
          Investment  Fund and are net of management and  performance  incentive
          fees or other allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers as
          required by the Investment Funds' agreements.  Each Investment Manager
          to which the Adviser  allocates assets will charge the Company,  as an
          investor in an underlying  Investment  Fund, an  asset-based  fee, and
          some or all of the Investment Managers will receive  performance-based
          compensation in the form of an incentive fee. The asset-based  fees of
          the Investment  Managers are generally expected to range from 1% to 3%
          annually of the net assets under their  management  and the  incentive
          fee is  generally  expected  to range  from 15% to 25% of net  profits
          annually.

          The Company may invest in Investment Funds that may designate  certain
          investments  within those Investment  Funds,  typically those that are
          especially  illiquid  and/or  hard to value,  as  "special  situation"
          (often called  "Side-Pocket")  investments with additional  redemption
          limitations.  Such a Side-Pocket  is, in effect,  similar to a private
          equity fund that  requires its  investors  to remain  invested for the
          duration of the fund and  distributes  returns on the investment  only
          when liquid assets are generated  within the fund,  typically  through
          the sale of the fund's illiquid assets in exchange for cash.

          As a general matter, the fair value of the Company's  investment in an
          Investment  Fund represents the amount that the Company can reasonably
          expect to receive if the Company's  investment  was sold in an orderly
          transaction at the time of valuation. The Investment Funds provide for
          periodic  redemptions  ranging from  monthly to  annually.  Investment
          Funds generally  require  advance notice of a shareholder's  intent to
          redeem its  interest,  and may,  depending  on the  Investment  Funds'
          governing agreements,  deny or delay a redemption request. The Company
          considers  if a liquidity  discount on any  Investment  Fund should be
          taken due to redemption  restrictions or suspensions by the Investment
          Fund.  However,  the effects of any discounts  were  determined by the
          Adviser to be  insignificant  at March 31,  2009,  and  therefore,  no
          discounts were applied to the fair value of the Investment  Funds. The
          underlying  investments of each  Investment  Fund are accounted for at
          fair  value  as  described  in  each   Investment   Fund's   financial
          statements.  The Investment Funds may invest a portion of their assets
          in restricted securities and other investments that are illiquid.

          Retroactive adjustments to the Company's net asset value might be made
          after the  valuation  date which could  impact the net asset value per
          share at which  shareholders  purchase  or sell  Company  shares.  The
          valuations  reported by the Investment  Funds,  upon which the Company
          calculates  its month end net asset value may be subject to adjustment
          subsequent to the valuation date,  based on information  which becomes
          available after that valuation date. For example,  fiscal year-end net
          asset  values of an  Investment  Fund may be  revised as a result of a
          year-end  audit  performed  by  the   independent   auditors  of  that
          Investment  Fund.  Other  adjustments to the Company's net asset value
          may also occur from time to time, such as from the  misapplication  by
          the Company or its agents of the valuation  policies  described in the
          Company's valuation procedures.

          Retroactive  adjustments  to the Company's net asset value,  which are
          caused  by  adjustments  to  the  Investment  Funds  values  or  by  a
          misapplication of the Company's valuation  policies,  that are able to
          be  made  within  90  days  of the  Valuation  Date(s)  to  which  the
          adjustment would apply will be made automatically unless determined to
          be de minimis. Other potential retroactive adjustments,  regardless of
          whether  their impact  increases or decreases  the Company's net asset
          value,   will  be  made  only  if  they  both  (i)  are  caused  by  a
          misapplication of the Company's  valuation policies and (ii) deemed to
          be material. All retroactive adjustments are reported to the Company's
          Valuation Committee and to affected shareholders.

          Effective June 30, 2009, the Company will adopt a policy which permits
          revisions to the number of shares  purchased  or sold by  shareholders
          due to retroactive  adjustments made under the circumstances described
          above which occur within 90 days of the Valuation Date.  Prior to June
          30, 2009, that automatic  90-day  adjustment  period was not in effect
          and retroactive valuation or share adjustments were not made.

          In circumstances where a retroactive  adjustment is not made under the
          circumstances  described  above,  then  shares  purchased  or  sold by
          shareholders will not be adjusted. As a result, to the extent that the
          subsequent  impact  of the  event  which  was not  adjusted  adversely
          affects the Company's net asset value,  the outstanding  Shares of the
          Company will be adversely  affected by prior repurchases made at a net
          asset value per share higher than the adjusted value. Conversely,  any
          increases in net asset value per share  resulting from such subsequent
          impact will be to the benefit of the holders of the outstanding Shares
          of the Company and to the detriment of Shareholders who previously had
          their Shares repurchased at a net asset value per Share lower than the
          post-impact  value. New Shareholders may be affected in a similar way,
          because the same principles apply to the purchase of Shares.

          B.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

          Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Income,  expenses and
          realized and unrealized gains and losses are recorded monthly.

          The change in an Investment  Fund's net asset value is included in net
          change in unrealized  appreciation on investments in Investment  Funds
          on the Statement of Operations. The Company records a realized gain or
          loss on its investment in Investment Funds only to the extent that the
          cost of such  investment  as well as any Side  Pocket  has been  fully
          recovered  through previous  redemptions from investment in Investment
          Funds.

          The  Company  bears  all  expenses  incurred  in  the  course  of  its
          operations,  including,  but not limited to, the following:  all costs
          and expenses  related to portfolio  transactions and positions for the
          Company's account; professional fees; costs of insurance; registration
          expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board of Directors.

          C.   INCOME TAXES

          The Company operated as a partnership from inception through September
          30, 2005. As of October 1, 2005, the Company became a corporation that
          is taxed as a regulated investment company.

          It is the Company's intention to meet the requirements of the Internal
          Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies (RIC) and
          distribute  substantially all of its taxable net investment income and
          capital  gains,  if any,  to  shareholders  each year.  Therefore,  no
          federal  income or excise tax  provision is required for the Company's
          financial   statements.   While  the  Company  intends  to  distribute
          substantially  all of its  taxable net  investment  income and capital
          gains,  in the manner  necessary to avoid  imposition of the 4% excise
          tax as described  above,  it is possible  that some excise tax will be
          incurred.  In such event,  the Company will be liable for the tax only
          on the  amount  by which it does not meet the  foregoing  distribution
          requirements.

          The Company has analyzed tax  positions  taken or expected to be taken
          in the course of preparing  the  Company's tax return for all open tax
          years and has concluded, as of March 31, 2009, no provision for income
          tax would be  required  in the  Company's  financial  statements.  The
          Company's  federal and state income and federal excise tax returns for
          tax years for which the applicable  statutes of  limitations  have not
          expired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and
          state departments of revenue.

          D.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

          Cash  and cash  equivalents  consist  of cash on  deposit  and  monies
          invested in money market  deposit  accounts  that are accounted for at
          amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

          E.   USE OF ESTIMATES

          The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.
          generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires management of the
          Company to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the amounts
          reported in the financial  statements and accompanying notes.  Changes
          in  the  economic  environment,   financial  markets,  and  any  other
          parameters  used in  determining  these  estimates  could cause actual
          results to differ materially.

     3.   FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

          In September 2006, the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
          157 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ("SFAS 157"), was issued by the FASB and
          is effective for fiscal years  beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS
          157 defines fair value,  establishes a framework  for  measuring  fair
          value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  SFAS 157
          requires  disclosure  surrounding  the various inputs that are used in
          determining the value of the Company's  investments.  These inputs are
          summarized into the three broad levels listed below.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Level 1- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
          securities
          Level 2- Other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
          risk, etc.)
          Level 3- Significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

          The notion of unobservable  inputs is intended to allow for situations
          in which there is little,  if any,  market  activity  for the asset or
          liability  at the  measurement  date.  Under  Level 3, the owner of an
          asset must determine valuation based on its own assumptions about what
          market  participants  would take into account in determining  the fair
          value of the asset, using the best information available.

          The  inputs  or  methodology  used  for  valuing  securities  are  not
          necessarily  an indication of the risk  associated  with  investing in
          those securities.

          The following is a summary of the inputs used as of March 31, 2009, in
          valuing the Company's assets and liabilities carried at fair value:

               Investment in Investment Funds

               Level 1               --
               Level 2               --

               Total       $486,647,680
                           ============

          Following  is  a  reconciliation   of  assets  for  which  significant
          unobservable inputs (Level 3) were used in determining fair value:

               Balances as of March 31, 2008                   $561,975,169
               Realized gain/loss                              $(47,690,528)
               Change in unrealized appreciation
               (depreciation)                                  $(46,582,350)
               Net purchases (sales)                           $ 18,945,389

                                                               ------------
               Balance as of March 31, 2009                    $486,647,680
                                                               ============
               The amount of total gains or losses for
               the year included in changes in
               shareholders' capital attributable to the
               change in unrealized appreciation
               (depreciation) relating to assets still held
               at year end.                                    $(43,079,897)
                                                               ============

          All net unrealized  gains/(losses) in the table above are reflected in
          the accompanying Statement of Operations.

     4.   MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
          OTHER

          The Adviser provides certain management and administrative services to
          the  Company.  The  Adviser  acts  primarily  to  evaluate  and select
          Investment  Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply risk
          management procedures,  and to monitor overall investment performance.
          In addition,  the Adviser also provides office space and other support
          services. In consideration for such services, The Company will pay the
          Adviser a monthly  management fee of 0.125% (1.5%  annually)  based on
          end of month Shareholder's capital.

          In addition,  the Adviser  allocated certain marketing fees of $29,418
          to the Company during the year ended March 31, 2009.

          Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to assist in the
          placement of the Company's Shares. A placement agent will generally be
          entitled  to receive a fee from each  investor  in the  Company  whose
          shares the agent places. The specific amount of the placement fee paid
          with respect to a  Shareholder  is generally  dependent on the size of
          the investment in the Company.

          Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a
          wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc. serves as a placement agent
          of the  Company's  Shares.  For the year  ended  March 31,  2009,  the
          Company  paid  $2,130,577  in placement  fees to CGM on the  Company's
          Shares.  Such fees are deducted from an investor's gross  contribution
          amount.

          The Company has entered into  agreements  with third parties to act as
          additional  placement agents for the Company's Shares.  Placement fees
          may  range  from 0 to 3%. In  addition  to the  placement  fee paid by
          Shareholders,  the Adviser  and/or its  affiliates  will pay placement
          agents an annual fee.  The annual fee is paid from the  Adviser's  own
          resources (or those of its affiliates).

          CAI  and  PNC  Global  Investment   Servicing  Inc.   ("PNCGIS"),   an
          independent  third  party  and  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  The  PNC
          Financial  Services Group,  have separate  agreements with the Company
          and act as co-administrators to the Company. CAI, as co-administrator,
          receives no fees for providing administrative services to the Company.
          PNCGIS provides certain  accounting,  recordkeeping,  tax and investor
          related  services.  PNCGIS  charges fees for their services based on a
          rate applied to the average net assets and are charged directly to the
          Company.

          Effective  January 1, 2008,  each  Director who is not an  "interested
          person" of the Company, as defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual
          retainer of $20,000  plus a Board of  Directors  meeting fee of $1,000
          and a  telephone  meeting  fee of  $500.  The  Chairman  of the  Audit
          Committee  receives an additional fee of $3,000 per year. Any Director
          who is an "interested person" does not receive any annual or other fee
          from the Company.

          All  Directors  are  reimbursed  for  all  reasonable  out  of  pocket
          expenses.  Total amounts  expensed related to Directors by the Company
          for the year ended March 31, 2009 were $87,000.

     5.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

          Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for Shares may be
          accepted as of the first day of each month. CAI has been authorized by
          the Board of  Directors of the Company to accept or reject any initial
          and additional  subscriptions for shares in the Company.  The Board of
          Directors  from  time  to  time  and in  its  complete  and  exclusive
          discretion,  may determine to cause the Company to  repurchase  shares
          from Shareholders  pursuant to written tenders by Shareholders on such
          terms  and  conditions  as it  may  determine.  CAI  expects  that  it
          typically  will  recommend to the Board of Directors  that the Company
          offer to repurchase shares from Shareholders  quarterly, on each March
          31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (or, if any such date is not
          a business day, on the immediately preceding business day).


          Transactions  in shares were as follows the years ended March 31, 2009

     6.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

          In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the
          Company  invests trade various  financial  instruments  and enter into
          various  investment  activities  with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These
          include,  but are not limited to, short  selling  activities,  writing
          option contracts and entering into equity swaps. The Company's risk of
          loss in  these  investment  funds  is  limited  to the  value  of it's
          investment in the respective Investment Funds.

     7.   INCOME TAX INFORMATION
          The tax  components  of  capital  shown in the table  below  represent
          distribution  requirements  the Company must satisfy  under the income
          tax  regulations,  losses the  Company  may be able to offset  against
          income and gains realized in future years and unrealized  appreciation
          or depreciation of securities and other investments for federal income
          tax purposes.

</TABLE>

          The  primary  difference  between  the  book and tax  appreciation  or
          depreciation of Investment Funds is attributable to adjustments to the
          tax basis of  Investment  Funds  based on  allocation  of  income  and
          distributions  from  Investment  Funds  and  the  tax  realization  of
          financial statement unrealized gain or loss. In addition,  the cost of
          Investment Funds for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items
          of taxable income allocated the Company from the Investment Funds. The
          allocated taxable income is reported to the Company by each Investment
          Fund on Schedule  K-1.  The  aggregate  cost on  Investment  Funds for
          federal  income tax purposes is  therefore  calculated  and  presented
          annually as of March 31. The aggregate  cost on  Investment  Funds and
          the  composition  of  unrealized   appreciation  and  depreciation  on
          Investment Funds for federal income tax purposes is noted below.

          Net  investment  income (loss) and net realized gain (loss) differ for
          financial  statement and tax purposes.  The character of dividends and
          distributions  made during the fiscal year from net investment  income
          or net realized gains differ from their ultimate  characterization for
          federal  income tax  purposes.  Also,  due to timing of dividends  and
          distributions, the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed differ
          from the  fiscal  year in which the  income or net  realized  gain was
          recorded by the Company.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2009 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Accordingly,  the following  amounts have been  reclassified for March
          31, 2009, and are primarily due to the different book to tax treatment
          for the  distributive  share of partnership  items,  the Company's net
          operating loss,  different book to tax treatment for gains realized on
          the sale of investment funds classified as passive foreign  investment
          companies and a non-deductable excise tax.

          Net assets of the Company were unaffected by the reclassifications.

          For the year ended March 31, 2009, the tax character of  distributions
          paid by the Company was  $6,403,370  ordinary  income and  $11,058,400
          long-term  capital  gains.  For the year ended March 31, 2008, the tax
          character of distributions paid by the Company was $5,892,742 ordinary
          income and $26,325,158 of long term capital gains.  Distributions from
          net  investment  income and  short-term  capital  gains are treated as
          ordinary income for federal income tax purposes.

          As  permitted  by federal  tax  rules,  the  Company  intends to treat
          capital losses of $35,743,773  incurred  between  November 1, 2008 and
          March 31, 2009 as being  incurred  during the tax year ending on March
          31, 2010.  These losses are available to offset future  capital gains,
          if any.

     8.   LOAN PAYABLE

          On December 27, 2006,  the Company  entered into a Credit and Security
          Agreement  with an  unaffiliated  bank  for a  $125,000,000  revolving
          credit facility (the "Credit Facility").  The Credit Facility was used
          in  connection  with  investment   activities,   for  cash  management
          purposes,  to fund  the  repurchase  of  Shares  or for  temporary  or
          emergency  purposes  as  permitted  under  the  Offering   Memorandum.
          Interest  expense on the amount  borrowed  during the year ended March
          31,  2009 was  $1,232,776,  all of which  has been  paid.  The  Credit
          Facility  matured on December 27, 2008. While the Company is currently
          considering  entering into a new Credit and Security Agreement,  there
          is no guarantee  that the Company will be successful in securing a new
          facility.

     9.   REDEMPTION PENALTY

          During the year ended  March 31,  2009,  the Company  paid  redemption
          penalties totaling  $2,199,068.  The redemption penalties were charged
          to the Company for redeeming its interests of certain Investment Funds
          prior to the expiration of applicable lock-up periods.  The payment of
          these  penalties  released the Company from any further  liability for
          its investments in the applicable  Investment Funds and is recorded as
          an operating expense in the Statement of Operations.

          POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

          As shown in the table above, Mr. Nolte is responsible for managing
          other accounts ("Other Accounts") in addition to the Fund. In certain
          instances, conflicts may arise in his management of the Fund and such
          other Accounts.

          One situation where a conflict may arise between the Fund and an Other
          Account is in the allocation of investment opportunities among the
          Fund and the Other Account. For example, the Adviser may determine
          that there is an opportunity that is suitable for the Fund as well as
          for Other Accounts of the Adviser, which have a similar investment
          objective. As a related matter, a particular Investment Fund interest
          or other security may be bought for one or more clients when one or
          more other clients are selling that same security, which may adversely
          affect the Fund. The Company and the Adviser have adopted policies and
          procedures regarding the allocation of investment opportunities, which
          generally require that investment opportunities be allocated among the
          Fund and Other Accounts in a manner that is fair, equitable and
          consistent with their fiduciary obligations to each.

          Mr. Nolte's management of the Fund and Other Accounts may result in
          his devoting a disproportionate amount of time and attention to the
          management of a particular account as against another. This
          particularly may be the case when accounts have different objectives,
          benchmarks, time horizons, asset levels and fees.

          The management of personal accounts by Mr. Nolte may give rise to
          potential conflicts of interest. While the Adviser's code of ethics
          will impose limits on the ability of Mr. Nolte to trade for his
          personal account, there is no assurance that the Adviser's code of
          ethics will eliminate such conflicts.

          Other than the conflicts described above, the Company is not aware of
          any material conflicts that may arise in connection with the Adviser's
          management of the Fund's investments and such Other Accounts.

  (a)(3)  COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM
  MEMBERS - AS OF MARCH 31, 2009

<PAGE>
          Mr. Nolte's compensation is a combination of salary, discretionary
          bonus, deferred compensation, retirement plans and automatic
          participation in a company-funded retirement bonus. The discretionary
          bonus is based upon the financial results and profitability of
          Citigroup as a whole, that of CAI as a whole, and that of CAI's Global
          Fund of Funds business unit, for which Mr. Nolte serves as chief
          executive. The discretionary bonus is not linked to the performance of
          any specific benchmark or that of any CAI investment fund or account;
          nor are specific asset size targets considered.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
      --------------------------------------------------------------------


I.       COVERED OFFICERS, PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This Code of Ethics  (the  "Code")  for the Fund  applies  to its Chief
         Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or
         persons  performing similar functions) (as of August 2005, Ray Nolte as
         President  and as of  December  2006 Amy Olsen as  Treasurer;  each,  a
         "Covered Officer") for the purpose of promoting:

         o        honest and ethical conduct,  including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent  conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         o        full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and  documents  that a company  files with, or submits
                  to, the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         o        compliance  with applicable  laws and  governmental  rules and
                  regulations;

         o        prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each  Covered  Officer  should  adhere to a high  standard  of
business  ethics and should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to
actual  as well as  apparent  conflicts  of  interest.  Any  question  about the
application  of the Code should be referred  to the Fund's  Chief Legal  Officer
(initially Millie Kim, General Counsel of the Fund's investment adviser).


II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
private interest interferes,  or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his or her service to, the Fund. For
<PAGE>

example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her
position with the Fund.(1)

         Certain  conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company Act") and
the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940  ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions  (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other  property)  with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated  persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its  investment  adviser's  compliance  programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures,  and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code,  unless or until the Chief Legal Officer  determines any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit,  conflicts  may  arise  from,  or  as  a  result  of,  the  contractual
relationship  between the Fund and its  investment  adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes that
the  Covered  Officers  will,  in the  normal  course of their  duties  (whether
formally  for  the  Fund  or for the  adviser,  or for  both),  be  involved  in
establishing  policies  and  implementing  decisions  that will  have  different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual  relationship between
the Fund and the adviser and is consistent  with the  performance by the Covered
Officers  of their  duties  as  officers  of the Fund.  Thus,  if  performed  in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically.  In
addition,  it is recognized by the Fund's Board of Directors  ("Board") that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other  conflicts  of  interest  are  covered by the Code,  even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to  provisions in the  Investment  Company
Act and the  Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the
personal  interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly  before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         o        use his or her personal  influence  or personal  relationships
                  improperly  to  influence  investment  decisions  or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered


- ----------
(1) Because conflicts of interest may arise as a result of family relationships,
each  Covered  Officer  should   consider  such  potential   conflicts  and,  if
appropriate,  familiarize  his or her family members with the Covered  Officer's
relevant obligations under this Code.
<PAGE>

                  Officer would benefit  personally  (directly or indirectly) to
                  the detriment of the Fund;

         o        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  (direct  or  indirect)  individual  personal  benefit  of  the
                  Covered Officer rather than the benefit of the Fund; or

         o        use material  non-public  knowledge of portfolio  transactions
                  made or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause
                  others to trade  personally  in  contemplation  of the  market
                  effect of such transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report all
affiliations  and significant  business  interests  outside the Citigroup,  Inc.
corporate group and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest  situations should always be approved by the Chief
Legal Officer and, if material,  be communicated to the relevant Fund's Board of
Directors. Examples of these include:

         o        service as a director on the board of any company;

         o        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts  and  gratuities  in  excess  of $100 per year  from any
                  person  or  entity   with  which  the  Fund  has   current  or
                  prospective business dealings,  not including occasional meals
                  or  tickets to theatre  or  sporting  events or other  similar
                  entertainment, provided it is business-related,  reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety.

         o        any  ownership  interest in, or any  consulting  or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers,  other
                  than   its    investment    adviser,    principal    placement
                  agent/underwriter, or any affiliated person thereof;

         o        a  direct  or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,
                  transaction  charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio  transactions  or for  selling or  redeeming  shares
                  other than an  interest  arising  from the  Covered  Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.


III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o        Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself or herself
                  with the disclosure  requirements  generally applicable to the
                  Fund;

         o        each Covered  Officer  should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or
                  cause others to misrepresent,  facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund,
<PAGE>

                  including  to  the  Fund's  Directors  and  auditors,  and  to
                  governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o        each Covered Officer should, to the extent  appropriate within
                  his or her area of responsibility, consult with other officers
                  and  employees  of the Fund and its  adviser  with the goal of
                  promoting  full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable
                  disclosure  in the reports and  documents the Fund files with,
                  or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made
                  by the Fund; and

         o        it is  the  responsibility  of  each  Covered  Officer  to use
                  reasonable  efforts to promote  compliance  with the standards
                  and  restrictions   imposed  by  applicable  laws,  rules  and
                  regulations.


IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o        upon  adoption of the Code  (thereafter  as  applicable,  upon
                  becoming  a Covered  Officer),  affirm in writing to the Board
                  that he or she has received, read and understands the Code;

         o        annually  thereafter  affirm to the  Board  that he or she has
                  complied with the requirements of the Code;

         o        not  retaliate  against  any  other  Covered  Officer  or  any
                  employee of the Fund or its affiliated  persons for reports of
                  potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o        notify the Chief Legal Officer  promptly if he or she knows of
                  any  violation  of this  Code.  Failure  to do so is  itself a
                  violation of this Code.

         The Chief  Legal  Officer  is  responsible  for  applying  this Code to
specific  situations  in  which  questions  are  presented  under it and has the
authority to  interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  However,  any
explicit or implicit  waivers(2)  sought by a Covered Officer must be considered
by the Audit Committee of the relevant Fund as described below.

         The Fund will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

         o        the  Chief  Legal  Officer  will  take  appropriate  action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him or her;


- ----------
(2) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines  "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material  departure  form a  provision  of the code of ethics"  and  "implicit
waiver" as "the  registrant's  failure to take action within a reasonable period
of time  regarding a material  departure  from a provision of the code of ethics
that has been made known to an executive officer" of the registrant.
<PAGE>

         o        if, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the Chief Legal Officer is not
                  required  to take any further  action,  but will meet with the
                  person  reporting  the  violation for the purpose of informing
                  such person of the reason for not taking action;

         o        any  matter  that  the  Chief  Legal  Officer  believes  is  a
                  violation  will be  reported  to the  Audit  Committee  of the
                  Fund's Board;

         o        if the Audit Committee  concurs that a violation has occurred,
                  they will  consider  appropriate  action,  which  may  include
                  review  of,  and  appropriate   modifications  to,  applicable
                  policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel
                  of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to
                  dismiss the Covered Officer as an officer of the Fund;

         o        the Audit Committee will be responsible for granting  waivers,
                  as appropriate,  provided that waivers will be considered only
                  if  supported  by a written  request on behalf of the relevant
                  Covered Officer  explaining the basis for such request and how
                  the waiver may be implemented  consistent  with the principles
                  underlying this Code; and

         o        any  changes to or  waivers  of this Code will,  to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

         The Audit Committee,  in determining  whether waivers should be granted
or whether violations have occurred,  and the Chief Legal Officer,  in rendering
decisions  and  interpretations  and in conducting  investigations  of potential
violations  under the Code,  may, at their  discretion,  consult with such other
persons as they  determine  to be  appropriate,  including,  but not limited to,
another  senior  legal  officer  of the Fund or its  investment  adviser  or its
affiliates,  counsel to the Fund or its  investment  adviser or such  affiliate,
counsel to the  Independent  Directors,  or (subject to applicable  pre-approval
requirements) independent auditors or other consultants


V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This  Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the Fund for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Fund,  the Fund's  investment  adviser,  principal
placement  agent/underwriter,  or other service  providers  govern or purport to
govern the  behavior or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to
this Code,  they are  superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or
conflict  with the  provisions  of this Code,  unless any provision of this Code
conflicts  with  any  applicable  federal  or  state  law,  in  which  case  the
requirements  of such law will govern.  The Fund's and its investment  adviser's
and principal placement agent/underwriter's codes of ethics under 17j-1
<PAGE>

under the Investment Company Act are separate requirements that may apply to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.


VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any  amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by a majority
vote of the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors.


VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this Code
will  be  considered   confidential   and  shall  be  maintained  and  protected
accordingly.  Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent  Directors and their
counsel,  the Fund and its  counsel and the  investment  adviser and its counsel
(and,  as relevant,  any other  person  described  in the last  paragraph  under
"Reporting and Accountability" above).


VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the Fund and does
not  constitute  an  admission,  by or on behalf  of the  Fund,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.





I  have  read  and   understand   the  terms  of  the  Code.  I  recognize   the
responsibilities  and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the Code.
