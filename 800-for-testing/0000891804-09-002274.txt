Dear SHAREHOLDER |

We thank you for your investment in the Advent Claymore Convertible Securities
and Income Fund (the "Fund"). This report covers the Fund's performance for the
semiannual period ended April 30, 2009.

The Fund's investment objective is to provide total return through a combination
of capital appreciation and current income. Under normal market conditions, the
Fund will invest at least 80% of its managed assets in a diversified portfolio
of convertible securities and non-convertible income securities. Under normal
market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 60% of its managed assets in
convertible securities and up to 40% in lower grade, non-convertible income
securities. Due to recent market volatility, the Fund may not be invested at
these levels at all times. Convertible securities represented 79.7% of the
portfolio as of April 30, 2009.

All Fund returns cited--whether based on net asset value ("NAV") or market
price--assume the reinvestment of all distributions. For the six-month period
ended April 30, 2009, the Fund generated a total return based on market price of
- -7.60% and a return of 8.75% based on NAV. As of April 30, 2009, the Fund's
market price of $11.40 represented a discount of 11.56% to NAV of $12.89.

The Fund currently implements its leverage strategy through the issuance of
Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"). As of October 31, 2008, the Fund's
leverage was $275 million. On December 1, 2008, the Fund announced a partial
at-par redemption of its outstanding AMPS, liquidation preference $25,000 per
share. Between December 23, 2008, and January 14, 2009, the Fund redeemed $13
million of its outstanding AMPS at prices equal to the liquidation preference
per share, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends as of the applicable redemption
date. Since January 14, 2009, the Fund's leverage has been maintained at $262
million.

The Fund has six series of AMPS, three that auction each week and three that
auction every 28 days. The broad auction-rate preferred securities market
remains essentially frozen, as it has been since February 2008. The auctions for
nearly all auction-rate preferred shares, including those issued by the Fund,
continue to fail. Investors need to be aware that a failed auction is not a
default, nor does it require the redemption of a fund's auction-rate preferred
shares. Provisions in the offering documents of the Fund's AMPS provide a
mechanism to set a maximum rate in the event of a failed auction, and, thus,
AMPS holders will continue to be entitled to receive dividends on the AMPS they
hold. This maximum rate is determined based upon a multiple of or a spread to
LIBOR, whichever is greater. During the six-month period ended April 30, 2009,
established maximum rates were based on a spread of 125 basis points over the
applicable LIBOR rates, with the maximum rates ranging from 1.48% to 5.76%. We
will continue to evaluate the benefits and effects of leverage on the Fund, as
well as exploring other methods of utilizing leverage.

In each month from December 2008 through May 2009, the Fund declared monthly
distributions of $0.0939 per common share. This monthly distribution rate
reflects a reduction of $0.0779 per share from the previous monthly distribution
rate of $0.1718 per common share, which was maintained through November 2008.
The Fund's management believes that reducing the distribution is a necessary
step to enhance our ability to maintain and potentially grow the Fund's net
asset value--which should benefit the Fund's shareholders over time. The

current distribution represents an annualized distribution rate of 9.88% based
upon the closing market price of $11.40 on April 30, 2009. There is no guarantee
of any future distributions or that the current returns and distribution rate
will be maintained.

We encourage common shareholders to consider the opportunity to reinvest their
distributions from the Fund through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP"),
which is described in detail on page 28 of this report. When shares trade at a
discount to NAV, the DRIP takes advantage of the discount by reinvesting the
monthly distribution in common shares of the Fund purchased in the market at a
price less than NAV. Conversely, when the market price of the Fund's common
shares is at a premium above NAV, the DRIP reinvests participants' distributions
in newly-issued common shares at NAV, subject to an IRS limitation that the
purchase price cannot be more than 5% below the market price per share. The DRIP
provides a cost-effective means to accumulate additional shares and enjoy the
benefits of compounding returns over time. Since the Fund endeavors to maintain
a steady monthly distribution rate, the DRIP plan effectively provides an income
averaging technique, which causes shareholders to accumulate a larger number of
Fund shares when the share price is depressed than when the price is higher.

The following Questions & Answers section provides more information about the
factors that affected the Fund's performance.

We are honored that you have chosen the Advent Claymore Convertible Securities
and Income Fund as part of your investment portfolio. For the most up-to-date

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS |


Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund (the "Fund") is managed
by a team of seasoned professionals at Advent Capital Management, LLC,
("Advent"), led by Tracy V. Maitland, Advent's President and Chief Investment
Officer. In the following interview, Mr. Maitland discusses the convertible
securities and high-yield markets and the performance of the Fund during the
six-month period ended April 30, 2009.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WILL YOU REMIND US OF THIS FUND'S OBJECTIVES AND HOW YOU SEEK TO ACHIEVE THEM?

The Fund's investment objective is to provide total return through a combination
of capital appreciation and current income. Under normal market conditions, the
Fund will invest at least 80% of its managed assets in a diversified portfolio
of convertible securities and non-convertible income securities. Under normal
market conditions, the Fund will invest at least 60% of its managed assets in
convertible securities and may invest up to 40% in lower grade, non-convertible
income securities, although the portion of the Fund's assets invested in
convertible securities and non-convertible income securities will vary from time
to time consistent with the Fund's investment objective, changes in equity
prices and changes in interest rates and other economic and market factors. The
Fund expects to invest approximately 70% of its assets in lower-grade
securities; however, from time to time it is possible that all of the Fund's
assets may be invested in lower-grade securities. Due to recent market
volatility, the Fund may not be invested at these levels at all times.

More than half of the convertible market and a large portion of the Fund's
convertible investments are in securities issued by growth
companies--particularly companies within the health care and technology sectors.
Growth companies generally issue convertible bonds or convertible preferred
stocks as a means of raising capital to build their businesses. Convertibles
represent something of a hybrid between equity and debt as a way to raise
capital for growth; convertibles generally have a lower interest rate than
non-convertible bonds, but entail less dilution than issuing common stock. By
offering convertible preferreds, companies can raise capital while helping to
keep their credit ratings higher than if they offered bonds. This is because
issuing bonds would increase the proportion of debt on an issuing company's
balance sheet, making a downgrade in credit rating more likely, while preferred
stock is classified as equity. Credit ratings are especially important to
financial companies, which are significant issuers of convertible preferred
securities, since a lower credit rating generally results in higher borrowing
costs.

The Fund's flexibility to shift between convertibles and high-yield bonds, also
known as "junk" bonds, helps provide diversification on an asset, sector and
security level. Among the attractions of convertible securities are that they
generally offer a yield advantage over common stocks; they have tended to
capture much of the upside when equity prices move up in stronger markets; and
the yield advantage has historically provided inherent downside protection in
weaker markets. However, there is no assurance that convertible securities will
participate significantly in any upward movement of the underlying common stock
or that they will provide protection from downward movements.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE TELL US ABOUT THE ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVER THE LAST SIX
MONTHS.

In the last annual report for this Fund, published six months ago, we described
a financial crisis that originated with the end of a housing boom fueled by
excessively easy credit. In early December 2008, the National Bureau of Economic
Research (NBER) officially declared that the U.S. economy had fallen into a
recession that began in December 2007. The U.S. economy continued to contract in
subsequent months, with drops in real Gross Domestic Product, a broad measure of
economic activity, at annual rates of more than 6% in the fourth quarter of 2008
and the first quarter of 2009.

After the September failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the credit markets
became so intolerant of risk that they were essentially frozen. As fearful
investors sought the protection of U.S. Treasury securities, interest spreads
between Treasury securities and bonds with any degree of credit risk widened
dramatically, and there were pronounced declines in the market values of asset
classes that carried any degree of risk.

The market for convertible securities, which in the past have been less volatile
than equities, was truly disastrous for several months. In September 2008, the
return of the Merrill Lynch All U.S. Convertibles Index was -14.59%, and in
October the return was -17.99%. These negative monthly returns rival the biggest
annual losses for convertibles in recorded history, which extends back to 1953.
To provide context for the pronounced decline last fall, the worst year ever for
convertibles was 1969, with a loss of about 15%. A major reason for the recent
poor performance of convertibles was selling by hedge funds, which had made
leveraged investments in convertibles while shorting the underlying common
stocks. Due to scarce available credit, the result was that convertible
securities were dumped on the market regardless of fundamentals, and prices
dropped precipitously.

Sometime in November, this forced selling came to an end. It appeared that
holders of convertible securities that had to sell had finished selling, and
other buyers noticed the unusual opportunity presented by very low prices of
convertibles. There was considerable buying by managers of equity and bond
accounts, many of which can use convertibles, since convertibles are debt
instruments that convert into equities. From mid-November through

<PAGE>

AVK | Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund | QUESTIONS &
ANSWERS continued


the end of this reporting period, there was a significant rebound in
convertibles. Positive returns were recorded by the Merrill Lynch All U.S.
Convertibles Index in four of the five months from December through April;
return of the index for the six-month period from October 31, 2008, through
April 30, 2009, was 11.50%.

Equity and bond markets began to recover at about the same time, though markets
have remained quite volatile, and returns for many indices were negative for the
six months ended April 30, 2009. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which is
generally regarded as a good indicator of the broad stock market, returned
- -8.53% for the six-month period ended April 30, 2009. In contrast to prior
periods, bonds with more credit risk generally performed better than less risky
bonds. The Barclays Capital US Aggregate Bond Index (formerly the Lehman
Aggregate), which measures the return of the high-quality U.S. bond market as a
whole, returned 7.74%, but the return of the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II
Index, which measures performance of the high-yield bond market, was 15.20%.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?

All Fund returns cited--whether based on net asset value ("NAV") or market
price--assume the reinvestment of all distributions. For the six-month period
ended April 30, 2009, the Fund generated a total return based on market price of
- -7.60% and a return of 8.75% based on NAV. As of April 30, 2009, the Fund's
market price of $11.40 represented a discount of 11.56% to NAV of $12.89. As of
October 31, 2008, the Fund's market price of $13.11 represented a premium of
4.71% to NAV of $12.52. The market value of the Fund's shares fluctuates from
time to time, and it may be higher or lower than the Fund's NAV. During the six
months from October 31, 2008, through April 30, 2009, the swing from a premium
over NAV to a discount from NAV inhibited the share price performance.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WERE THE MAJOR INVESTMENT DECISIONS THAT AFFECTED THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE?

Of course we are pleased to report a positive return at NAV for this period,
after a massive setback in the disastrous market of the Fund's prior fiscal
year. In retrospect, it is clear that our cautiousness in managing the Fund was
the main reason its return was less than the rebound of the Merrill Lynch All
U.S. Convertibles Index for the six months ended April 2009. As markets once
again began to embrace risk, following the credit panic of 2008, securities with
lower credit quality and those in industries considered to be more risky
generally performed best. Over this period, the weighted average credit rating
of the securities in the Fund's portfolio was BB+, which is the highest rating
for below- investment-grade bonds, and just a small step below investment-grade.
In light of the very difficult market conditions in the early portion of the
period, we felt that this emphasis on more conservative, higher quality
securities was appropriate, even though the Fund has the ability to be invested
entirely in below-investment-grade securities. However, the lowest rated and
riskiest securities, which had fallen to extremely low levels in the autumn of
2008, moved up sharply during this period. The Fund's portfolio, with an
emphasis on higher quality within the realm of below- investment-grade
securities, did not recover as strongly as riskier securities did.

Our cautiousness, which we consider appropriate for a time of extreme market
turmoil, took several forms. For much of the period, the Fund had a higher than
usual cash position in order to minimize volatility and also to keep favorable
AAA credit ratings on the Fund's auction market preferred shares. In addition,
we maintained a weighted average credit rating of approximately BB+. This
quality profile detracted, as lower-rated securities performed better. The
Fund's leverage contributed to performance, but the positive effect of the
leverage was insufficient to overcome our lower level of credit risk in this
unusually sharp market rebound.

Negative for performance was the Fund's considerable weight in health care,
which represented 20.7% of the portfolio as of April 30, 2009. Health care is an
industry that is relatively insensitive to economic conditions, and health care
investments held up well during the recession, contributing to performance in
prior periods. Most of the Fund's health care positions are in strong companies
such as Teva Pharmaceutical Finance LLC (3.1% of long-term investments), the
world's largest generic drug company, and medical device manufacturer Medtronic,
Inc. (2.8% of long-term investments). These companies have enjoyed increasing
cash flow and have not needed additional funding, but during the recent rebound,
performance of health care issues lagged. On one hand, few health care companies
will benefit from economic recovery. On the other hand, there is some concern
about how changes in health care policy implemented by the new Democratic
administration might affect the profitability of health care companies. We are
comfortable with our health care investments, especially considering that past
experience indicates that industries that have price controls generally have
wider profit margins and stronger credit ratings than companies that are exposed
to freer competition.

During the first half of the fiscal period, one of the largest single positions
was a convertible preferred of Mylan, Inc. (2.0% of long-term investments),
which also provided the highest return to the portfolio, as the company's
earnings proved surprisingly strong thanks to synergies realized from an
acquisition. The next biggest contribution was also in health care. Our position
in Schering-Plough Corporation (1.3% of long-term investments) convertible
preferred shares surged when the company became the object of an acquisition by
joint-venture partner, Merck & Co., Inc. (not held in the portfolio at period
end). The third largest contribution was from Johnson Controls, Inc. (0.8% of
long-term investments), a provider of products that optimize energy usage in
buildings and vehicles. The company issued a new convertible bond that promptly
surged in price as economic prospects improved and many cyclical stocks like
Johnson Controls--with notable exposure to the global auto industry--enjoyed a
sharp recovery. The biggest detractor from performance was Avery Dennison (not
held in portfolio at period end), followed by two financials, KeyCorp (0.6% of
long-term investments) and SLM Corp. (0.7% of long-term investments). KeyCorp
shares suffered on continued worries about bad loans and capital adequacy, while
SLM was hit by proposed legislation that might effectively nationalize the
student loan business and thereby bypass much of SLM's business. Avery Dennison
Corporation's formerly stable office supplies business weakened sharply
following a major acquisition and an increase in financial leverage just in time
for the recession. A tender offer by Avery Dennison induced us to convert to
common on favorable terms, but the stock tumbled, and we sold at a loss.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW HAS THE FUND'S LEVERAGE STRATEGY AFFECTED PERFORMANCE?

The Fund utilizes leverage (borrowing) as part of its investment strategy, to
finance the purchase of additional securities that provide increased income and
potentially greater appreciation potential to common shareholders than could be
achieved from a portfolio that is not leveraged. The Fund currently implements
its leverage strategy through the issuance of Auction Market Preferred Shares
("AMPS").

As of October 31, 2008, the Fund's leverage was $275 million. On December 1,
2008, the Fund announced a partial at-par redemption of its outstanding AMPS,
liquidation preference $25,000 per share. Between December 23, 2008, and January
14, 2009, the Fund redeemed $13 million of its outstanding AMPS at prices equal
to the liquidation preference per share, plus accumulated but unpaid dividends
as of the applicable redemption date. Since January 14, 2009, the Fund's
leverage has been maintained at $262 million.

The Fund has six series of AMPS, three that auction each week and three that
auction every 28 days. The broad auction-rate preferred securities market
remains essentially frozen, as it has been since February 2008. The auctions for
nearly all auction-rate preferred shares, including those issued by the Fund,
continue to fail. Investors need to be aware that a failed auction is not a
default, nor does it require the redemption of a fund's auction-rate preferred
shares. Provisions in the offering documents of the Fund's AMPS provide a
mechanism to set a maximum rate in the event of a failed auction, and, thus,
AMPSholders will continue to be entitled to receive dividends on the AMPS they
hold. This maximum rate is determined based upon a multiple of or a spread to
LIBOR, whichever is greater. During the six-month period ended April 30, 2009,
established maximum rates were based on a spread of 125 basis points over the
applicable LIBOR rates, with the maximum rates ranging from 1.48% to 5.76%.

We will continue to evaluate the benefits and effects of leverage on the Fund,
as well as explore other types of leverage. Given the very low interest rates
that have been established for the Fund's AMPS over the last six months, the
leverage has been helpful as the market has rebounded. During this period
leverage has helped to create capital appreciation and has contributed to
income, since the portfolio is yielding more than the cost of leverage.

There is no guarantee that the Fund's leverage strategy will be successful, and
the Fund's use of leverage may cause the Fund's NAV and market price of common
shares to be more volatile. Leverage adds value only when the total return on
securities purchased exceeds the cost of leverage.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT OUTLOOK FOR THE MARKETS AND THE FUND?
Six months ago, we said that market conditions for equities, bonds and
convertible securities were so bad that some improvement seemed almost
inevitable, and, in fact, we have seen considerable recovery since then. There
are early signs of improvement in some broad economic statistics, and credit
markets have definitely improved in the last few months. After several months of
frozen markets, in early 2009 a few investment grade companies floated new
issues of straight bonds. Then it became possible for a few speculative bond
issuers to float new bonds. Next, the market for convertible bonds re-opened,
initially with companies rated BBB and BB; more recently, some lower-rated
companies have been able to issue convertibles.

Our outlook for the convertible market is very positive for the months ahead.
Rising prices of debt instruments such as high yield bonds and bank loans are
positive, since fixed-income values are the underpinning of convertible
securities. Experience from past recessions indicates that the economy and the
stock market recover after credit markets begin to improve. An improving economy
will mean more new issues of bonds and convertibles, as companies seek to fund
their growth and to strengthen their balance sheets.

Over time, convertible securities have historically provided equity-like returns
at lower risk by capturing much of the appreciation of common stocks, while
yielding more than equities and experiencing less price deterioration during
market corrections. So we find convertibles very attractive at current prices;
in fact, approximately 80% of the Fund's portfolio is invested in convertibles,
well above the 60% requirement. The Fund's return has lagged returns of some
other convertible funds over the last few months, in part because some other
funds have invested more heavily in high-yield straight bonds, which have
recently performed very well. But we believe that convertibles, with their
equity-like returns and lower risk, will provide superior returns over the long
term.



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The conversion premium reflects the market price of a convertible relative to
the market value of the common shares into which the convertible security can be
converted. For example, a bond trading at a par value of $1,000 that is
convertible into 20 shares trading at $40 would have a conversion premium of 25%
over its conversion value of $800. The lower the conversion premium, the more
upside there is for convertible investors. If the stock performs poorly, the
convertible normally provides downside protection based on its yield and its
fixed-income value.

INDEX DEFINITIONS:

Indices are unmanaged and it is not possible to invest directly in any index.

The Merrill Lynch All U.S. Convertibles Index (VXA0) is comprised of
approximately 500 issues of convertible bonds and preferred stock of all
qualities.

S&P 500 Index is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The index is
designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in
the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries.

The Barclays Capital US Aggregate Bond Index covers the U.S. dollar-denominated,
investment-grade, fixed rate, taxable bond market of SEC-registered securities.

AVK | Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund | QUESTIONS &
ANSWERS continued



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVK RISKS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

The views expressed in this report reflect those of the Portfolio Managers and
Claymore only through the report period as stated on the cover. These views are
subject to change at any time, based on market and other conditions and should
not be construed as a recommendation of any kind. The material may also contain
forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty, and there is no
guarantee they will come to pass. There can be no assurance that the Fund will
achieve its investment objectives. The value of the Fund will fluctuate with the
value of the underlying securities. Historically, closed-end funds often trade
at a discount to their net asset value. The Fund is subject to investment risk,
including the possible loss of the entire amount that you invest. Past
performance does not guarantee future results.

CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES. The Fund is not limited in the percentage of its assets
that may be invested in convertible securities. Convertible securities generally
offer lower interest or dividend yields than non-convertible securities of
similar quality. The market values of convertible securities tend to decline as
interest rates increase and, conversely, to increase as interest rates decline.
However, the convertible security's market value tends to reflect the market
price of the common stock of the issuing company when that stock price is
greater than the convertible's "conversion price, " which is the predetermined
price at which the convertible security could be exchanged for the associated
stock.

SYNTHETIC CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES. The value of a synthetic convertible security
will respond differently to market fluctuations than a convertible security
because a synthetic convertible security is composed of two or more separate
securities, each with its own market value. In addition, if the value of the
underlying common stock or the level of the index involved in the convertible
component falls below the exercise price of the warrant or option, the warrant
or option may lose all value.

LOWER GRADE SECURITIES. Investing in lower grade securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") involves additional risks, including credit risk. Credit risk is
the risk that one or more securities in the Fund's portfolio will decline in
price, or fail to pay interest or principal when due, because the issuer of the
security experiences a decline in its financial status.

LEVERAGE RISK. Certain risks are associated with the leveraging of common stock.
Both the net asset value and the market value of shares of common stock may be
subject to higher volatility and a decline in value.

INTEREST RATE RISK. In addition to the risks discussed above, convertible
securities and non-convertible income securities are subject to certain risks,
including:

o    if interest rates go up, the value of convertible securities and
     nonconvertible income securities in the Fund's portfolio generally will
     decline;

o    during periods of declining interest rates, the issuer of a security may
     exercise its option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the
     Fund to reinvest in lower yielding securities. This is known as call or
     prepayment risk. Lower grade securities have call features that allow the
     issuer to repurchase the security prior to its stated maturity. An issuer
     may redeem a lower grade security if the issuer can refinance the security
     at a lower cost due to declining interest rates or an improvement in the
     credit standing of the issuer; and

o    during periods of rising interest rates, the average life of certain types
     of securities may be extended because of slower than expected principal
     payments. This may lock in a below market interest rate, increase the
     security's duration (the estimated period until the security is paid in
     full) and reduce the value of the security. This is known as extension
     risk.

ILLIQUID INVESTMENTS. The Fund may invest without limit in illiquid securities.
The Fund may also invest without limit in Rule 144A Securities. Although many of
the Rule 144A Securities in which the Fund invests may be, in the view of the
Investment Manager, liquid, if qualified institutional buyers are unwilling to
purchase these Rule 144A Securities, they may become illiquid. Illiquid
securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the
Fund believes it is desirable to do so. The market price of illiquid securities
generally is more volatile than that of more liquid securities, which may
adversely affect the price that the Fund pays for or recovers upon the sale of
illiquid securities.

FOREIGN SECURITIES AND EMERGING MARKETS RISK. Investing in non-U.S. issuers may
involve unique risks, such as currency, political, economic and market risk. In
addition, investing in emerging markets entails additional risk including, but
not limited to (1) news and events unique to a country or region (2) smaller
market size, resulting in lack of liquidity and price volatility (3) certain
national policies which may restrict the Fund's investment opportunities.

STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS. The Fund may use various other investment management
techniques that also involve certain risks and special considerations, including
engaging in hedging and risk management transactions, including interest rate
and foreign currency transactions, options, futures, swaps, caps, floors, and
collars and other derivatives transactions.

AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES (AMPS) RISK. The AMPS are redeemable, in whole
or in part, at the option of the Fund on any dividend payment date for the AMPS,
and are subject to mandatory redemption in certain circumstances. The AMPS are
not listed on an exchange. You may buy or sell AMPS only through an order placed
at an auction with or through a broker-dealer that has entered into an agreement
with the auction agent and the Fund or in a secondary market maintained by
certain broker-dealers. These broker-dealers are not required to maintain this
market, and it may not provide you with liquidity.

In addition to the risks described above, the Fund is also subject to:
Management Risk, Market Disruption Risk, and Anti-Takeover Provisions. Please
see www.claymore.com/avk for a more detailed discussion about Fund risks and
considerations.

AVK | Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund


Notes to FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | APRIL 30, 2009 (unaudited)



Note 1 - ORGANIZATION:

Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund (the "Fund") was
organized as a Delaware statutory trust on February 19, 2003. The Fund is
registered as a diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Note 2 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund.

(A) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

Equity securities listed on an exchange are valued at the last reported sale
price on the primary exchange on which they are traded. Equity securities traded
on an exchange for which there are no transactions on a given day are valued at
the mean of the closing bid and asked prices. Securities traded on NASDAQ are
valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. Equity securities not listed on a
securities exchange or NASDAQ are valued at the mean of the closing bid and
asked prices. Debt securities are valued by independent pricing services or
dealers using the mean of the closing bid and asked prices for such securities
or, if such prices are not available, at prices for securities of comparable
maturity, quality and type. For those securities where quotations or prices are
not available, valuations are determined in accordance with procedures
established in good faith by the Board of Trustees. Futures contracts are valued
using the settlement price established each day on the exchange on which they
are traded. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less
are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 157, "Fair Valuation
Measurements" ("FAS 157"). This standard clarifies the definition of fair value
for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FAS
157 establishes three different categories for valuations. Level 1 valuations
are those based upon quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 valuations are
those based upon quoted prices in inactive markets or based upon significant
observable inputs (e.g. yield curves; benchmark interest rates; indices). Level
3 valuations are those based upon unobservable inputs (e.g. discounted cash flow
analysis; non-market based methods used to determine fair valuation). Details of
the valuations as of April 30, 2009 were as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------

(B) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on an
accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities purchased are accreted
or amortized to interest income over the lives of the respective securities
using the effective interest method.

(C) CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
U.S. dollars at the mean of the bid and asked price of respective exchange rates
on the last day of the period. Purchases and sales of investments denominated in
foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the date of the
transaction.

The Fund does not isolate that portion of the results of operations resulting
from changes in foreign exchange rates on investments from the fluctuations
arising from changes in market prices of securities held. Such fluctuations are
included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.


                                         Semiannual Report | April 30, 2009 | 19

<PAGE>

AVK | Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund | NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) CONTINUED


Foreign exchange realized gain or loss resulting from the holding of a foreign
currency, expiration of a currency exchange contract, difference in exchange
rates between the trade date and settlement date of an investment purchased or
sold, and the difference between dividends or interest actually received
compared to the amount shown in a Fund's accounting records on the date of
receipt is shown as net realized gains or losses on foreign currency
transactions in the Fund's Statement of Operations.

Foreign exchange unrealized gain or loss on assets and liabilities, other than
investments, is shown as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign
currency translation in the Fund's Statement of Operations.

(D) COVERED CALL OPTIONS

The Fund may employ an option strategy of writing (selling) covered call options
on securities held in the portfolio of the Fund. The Fund uses options as part
of a portfolio management or hedging technique to seek to protect against
possible adverse changes in the market value of securities held in or to be
purchased for the Fund's portfolio, or to protect the value of the Fund's
portfolio.

An option on a security is a contract that gives the holder of the option, in
return for a premium, the right to buy from (in the case of a call) or sell to
(in the case of a put) the writer of the option the security underlying the
option at a specified exercise or "strike" price. The writer of an option on a
security has the obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver the
underlying security upon payment of the exercise price (in the case of a call)
or to pay the exercise price upon delivery of the underlying security (in the
case of a put).

There are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities.
As the writer of a covered call option, the Fund forgoes, during the option's
life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the
security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike
price of the call, but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the
underlying security decline. The writer of an option has no control over the
time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as writer of the option.
Once an option writer has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect a
closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the
option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability and is subsequently marked to market to reflect the current
market value of the option written. These liabilities are reflected as options
written in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Premiums received from
writing options which expire unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as
a realized gain. The difference between the premium received and the amount paid
on effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is
also treated as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid
for the closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss.

(E) SWAPS

A swap is an agreement to exchange the return generated by one instrument for
the return generated by another instrument. The Fund may enter into swap
agreements to manage its exposure to interest rates and/or credit risk or to
generate income. Interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange by the Fund
with another party of their respective commitments to pay or receive interest.
Total return swap agreements involve commitments to receive (and pay) interest
over a floating rate (LIBOR) based on a notional amount. To the extent the total
return of the security (price changes, interest paid/received, rebate earned on
collateral posted by the Fund) is positive, the Fund will receive a payment from
the counterparty (or if negative, make a payment to the counterparty). The swaps
are valued daily at current market value and any unrealized gain or loss is
included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Gain or loss is realized on
the termination date of the swap and is equal to the difference between the
Fund's basis in the swap and the proceeds of the closing transaction, including
any fees. During the period that the swap agreement is open, the Fund may be
subject to risk from the potential inability of the counterparty to meet the
terms of the agreement. The swaps involve elements of both market and credit
risk in excess of the amounts reflected on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Upon termination of a swap agreement, a payable to or receivable
from swap counterparty is established on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities
to reflect the net gain/loss, including interest income/expense, on terminated
swap positions. This line item is removed upon settlement according to the terms
of the swap agreement.

Realized gain (loss) upon termination of swap contracts is recorded on the
Statement of Operations. Fluctuations in the value of swap contracts are
recorded as a component of net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation)
of swap contracts. Net periodic payments received by the Fund are included as
part of realized gains (losses) and, in the case of accruals for periodic
payments, are included as part of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the
Statement of Operations.

<PAGE>

AVK | Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund | NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) CONTINUED


(F) SECURITIES LENDING

The Fund may lend its securities to broker-dealers and financial institutions.
The loans are collateralized by cash or securities at least equal at all times
to the market value of the securities loaned. The Fund may bear the risk of
delay in recovery of, or loss of rights in, the securities loaned should the
borrower of the securities experience financial difficulty. The Fund receives
compensation for lending its securities in the form of fees or it retains a
portion of interest on the investment of any cash received as collateral. The
Fund also continues to receive interest and dividends on the securities loaned,
and any gain or loss in the market price of the securities loaned that may occur
during the term of the loan will be for the account of the Fund. As of April 30,
2009, the Fund had no securities on loan.

(G) CONCENTRATION OF RISK

It is the Fund's policy to invest a significant portion of its assets in
convertible securities. Although convertible securities do derive part of their
value from that of the securities into which they are convertible, they are not
considered derivative financial instruments. However, certain of the Fund's
investments include features which render them more sensitive to price changes
in their underlying securities. Consequently, this exposes the Fund to greater
downside risk than traditional convertible securities, but still less than that
of the underlying common stock.

(H) DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund declares and pays monthly dividends to common shareholders. These
dividends consist of investment company taxable income, which generally includes
qualified dividend income, ordinary income and short-term capital gains. Any net
realized long-term gains are distributed annually to common shareholders.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount
and timing of distributions are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.


Note 3 - INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, SERVICING AGREEMENT AND OTHER
AGREEMENTS:

Pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement") between the
Fund and Advent Capital Management, LLC, the Fund's investment adviser (the
"Advisor"), the Advisor is responsible for the daily management for the Fund's
portfolio of investments, which includes buying and selling securities for the
Fund, as well as investment research. The Advisor will receive an annual fee
from the Fund based on the average value of the Fund's Managed Assets, which
includes the amount from the issuance of the Preferred Shares. In addition,
subject to the approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees, a pro rata portion of
the salaries, bonuses, health insurance, retirement benefits and similar
employment costs for the time spent on Fund operations (other than the provision
of services required under the Agreement) of all personnel employed by the
Advisor who devote substantial time to Fund operations may be reimbursed by the
Fund to the Advisor. For the six months ended April 30, 2009, the Advisor was
not reimbursed by the Fund for these items. The annual fee will be determined as
follows:

(a)  If the average value of the Fund's Managed Assets (calculated monthly) is
     greater than $250 million, the fee will be a maximum amount equal to 0.54%
     of the average value of the Fund's Managed Assets. In addition, the Advisor
     has agreed to waive receipt of a portion of the management fee or other
     expenses of the Fund in the amount of 0.115% of the average value of
     Managed Assets for the first five years of the Fund's operations ending
     April 30, 2008. Effective May 1, 2008, the Advisor waived receipt of a
     portion of the management fee or other expenses of the Fund in the amount
     of 0.065% of the average value of Managed Assets for an additional one
     year. For the six months ended April 30, 2009, the Advisor waived advisory
     fees of $174,252. Effective May 1, 2009, the Advisory Fee waiver was
     reduced to 0.03% of the average value of Managed Assets for an additional
     year.

Pursuant to a Servicing Agreement between the Fund and Claymore Securities,
Inc., the Fund's servicing agent (the "Servicing Agent"), the Servicing Agent
will act as servicing agent to the Fund. The Servicing Agent will receive an
annual fee from the Fund, which will be based on the average value of the Fund's
Managed Assets. The fee will be determined as follows:

(a)  If the average value of the Fund's Managed Assets (calculated monthly) is
     greater than $250 million, the fee will be a maximum amount equal to 0.21%
     of the average value of the Fund's Managed Assets. In addition, the
     Servicing Agent has agreed to waive receipt of a portion of the servicing
     fee of the Fund in the amount of 0.085% of the average value of Managed
     Assets for the first five years of the Fund's operations ending April 30,
     2008. Effective May 1, 2008, the Servicing Agent waived receipt of a
     portion of the servicing fee of the Fund in the amount of 0.065% of the
     average value of Managed Assets for an additional one year. For the six
     months ended April 30, 2009, the Servicing Agent waived fees of $174,252.
     Effective May 1, 2009, the Servicing Fee waiver was reduced to 0.04% of the
     average value of Managed Assets for an additional year.

The fee waivers of the Advisor and the Servicing Agent are contractual
commitments of more than one year and are not subject to recoupment.

trustees who are officers of the aforementioned firms.

Note 4 - FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to regulated
investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes is
required. In addition, by distributing substantially all of its ordinary income
and long-term capital gains, if any, during each calendar year, the Fund can
avoid a 4% federal excise tax that is assessed on the amount of the
under-distribution.

At April 30, 2009, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation on investments for tax purposes, excluding swap agreements are as
follows:

- ------------------------------------------------

The differences between book basis and tax basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) are attributable to the tax deferral of losses on
wash sales and income adjustments for tax purposes on certain convertible
securities.

At October 31, 2008, for federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital
loss carryforward of $96,787,165 available to offset possible future capital
gains. The capital loss carryforward is set to expire on October 31, 2016.

For the years ended October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007, the tax character of
distributions paid of $54,863,421 and $53,996,821 was ordinary income,
$8,493,296 and $21,390,145 was long-term capital gain, and $363,640 and $0 was
return of capital, respectively.

On July 13, 2006, the FASB released FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how
uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed
in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions
taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund's tax returns
to determine whether the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being
sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in
the current year. Management has evaluated the implication of FIN 48 and has
determined it does not have any impact on the financial statements as of April
30, 2009. There is no tax liability

resulting from unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain income tax
positions taken or expected to be taken on the tax return for the fiscal
year-end October 31, 2008. The Fund is also not aware of any tax positions for
which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax
benefits will significantly change in twelve months.

FIN 48 requires the Fund to analyze all open tax years. Open tax years are those
years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority. As
of April 30, 2009, open Federal and state income tax years include the tax years
ended October 31, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. The Fund has no examination in
progress.


Note 5 - INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES:

For the six months ended April 30, 2009, purchases and sales of investments,
excluding options and short-term securities, were $344,259,217 and $336,049,653,
respectively.

The Fund entered into credit default swap agreements during the six months ended
April 30, 2009 to generate additional income. As of April 30, 2009, the Fund had

Dividends are accumulated daily at a rate set through an auction process. The
broad auction-rate preferred securities market, including the Fund's AMPS, has
experienced considerable disruption since mid-February, 2008. The result has
been failed auctions on nearly all auction-rate preferred shares, including the
Fund's AMPS. A failed auction is not a default, nor does it require the
redemption of the Fund's AMPS.

Provisions in the AMPS offering documents establish a maximum rate in the event
of a failed auction. The AMPS reference rate is the seven day LIBOR Rate for a
dividend period of 7 to 21 days, and the one month LIBORRate for a dividend
period of more than 21 days, but fewer than 49 days. The maximum rate, for
auctions for which the Fund has not given notice that the auction will consist
of net capital gains or other taxable income, is the higher of the reference
rate times 125% or the reference rate plus 1.25%. Distributions of net realized
gains, if any, are made annually.

Management will continue to monitor events in the marketplace and continue to
evaluate the Fund's leverage as well as any alternative that may be available.

For the six months ended April 30, 2009, the annualized dividend rates ranged
from:

                    HIGH                 LOW            AT APRIL 30, 2009

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.


Note 8 - INDEMNIFICATIONS:

In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations, which provide general indemnifications. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.


Note 9 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT:

On May 1, 2009, the Fund declared a monthly dividend to common shareholders of
$0.0939 per common share. This dividend is payable on May 29, 2009 to
shareholders of record on May 15, 2009. On June 1, 2009, the Fund declared a
monthly dividend to common shareholders of $0.0939 per common share. This
dividend is payable on June 30, 2009 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2009.

Note 10 - ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This standard is intended to enhance
financial statement disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and enable investors to understand: a) how and why a fund uses
derivative instruments, b) how derivatives instruments and related hedge fund
items are accounted for, and c) how derivative instruments and related hedge
items affect a fund's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
SFAS No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. In September 2008, the FASB
issued a Staff Position amending SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This amendment would require disclosures by
sellers of credit derivatives, including credit derivatives embedded in a hybrid
instrument. This amendment is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years and interim periods ending after November 15, 2008. As of April 30,
2009, management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 161 nor amended SFAS
No. 133 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional
footnote disclosures may be required about the use of derivative instruments and
hedging items.

In April 2009, the FASB issued FSP FAS 157-4, "Determining Fair Value When
Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly
Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly" (FSP 157-4). FSP
157-4 provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and
liabilities when the volume and level of activity for the asset/liability has
significantly decreased. FSP 157-4 also provides guidance on identifying
circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. In addition, FSP 157-4
requires disclosure in interim and annual periods of the inputs and valuation
techniques used to measure fair value and a discussion of changes in valuation
techniques. FSP 157-4 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods
ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of FSP 157-4 is not expected to have a
significant impact on these financial statements.

AVK | Advent Claymore Convertible Securities and Income Fund


Dividend Reinvestment PLAN | (unaudited)

Unless the registered owner of common shares elects to receive cash by
contacting the Plan Administrator, all dividends declared on common shares of
the Fund will be automatically reinvested by The Bank of New York Mellon (the
"Plan Administrator"), Administrator for shareholders in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), in additional common shares of the Fund.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by notice if received and processed by the
Plan Administrator prior to the dividend record date; otherwise such termination
or resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared
dividend or other distribution. Some brokers may automatically elect to receive
cash on your behalf and may re-invest that cash in additional common shares of
the Fund for you. If you wish for all dividends declared on your common shares
of the Fund to be automatically reinvested pursuant to the Plan, please contact
your broker.

The Plan Administrator will open an account for each common shareholder under
the Plan in the same name in which such common shareholder's common shares are
registered. Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or other distribution
(together, a "Dividend") payable in cash, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common
shares. The common shares will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for the
participants' accounts, depending upon the circumstances described below, either
(i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized common shares from the
Fund ("Newly Issued Common Shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding common
shares on the open market ("Open-Market Purchases") on the New York Stock
Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the closing
market price plus estimated brokerage commission per common share is equal to or
greater than the net asset value per common share, the Plan Administrator will
invest the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares on behalf of the
participants. The number of Newly Issued Common Shares to be credited to each
participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
Dividend by the net asset value per common share on the payment date; provided
that, if the net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the closing market
value on the payment date, the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by
95% of the closing market price per common share on the payment date. If, on the
payment date for any Dividend, the net asset value per common share is greater
than the closing market value plus estimated brokerage commission, the Plan
Administrator will invest the Dividend amount in common shares acquired on
behalf of the participants in Open-Market Purchases.

If, before the Plan Administrator has completed its Open-Market Purchases, the
market price per common share exceeds the net asset value per common share, the
average per common share purchase price paid by the Plan Administrator may
exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting in the acquisition of
fewer common shares than if the Dividend had been paid in Newly Issued Common
Shares on the Dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to Open-Market Purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan
Administrator is unable to invest the full Dividend amount in Open-Market
Purchases during the purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a
market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease
making Open-Market Purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the
Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares at net asset value per common
share at the close of business on the Last Purchase Date provided that, if the
net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the then current market price
per common share; the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by 95% of
the market price on the payment date.

The Plan Administrator maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including
information needed by shareholders for tax records. Common shares in the account
of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator on behalf of the
Plan participant, and each shareholder proxy will include those shares purchased
or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Administrator will forward all proxy
solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held under
the Plan in accordance with the instruction of the participants.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to common shares issued directly
by the Fund. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage
commission incurred in connection with Open-Market Purchases. The automatic
reinvestment of Dividends will not relieve participants of any Federal, state or
local income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such
Dividends.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants with regard to purchases in the Plan; however,
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants.

All correspondence or questions concerning the Plan should be directed to the
Plan Administrator, BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, PO Box 358015, Pittsburgh,
PA 15252-8015, Phone Number: (866) 488-3559.

Investment Management
AGREEMENT CONTRACT RE-APPROVAL | (unaudited)


INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT RE-APPROVAL

Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")
contemplates that the Board of Trustees (the "Board") of Advent Claymore
Convertible Securities and Income Fund (the "Fund"), including a majority of the
Trustees who have no direct or indirect interest in the investment management
agreement and are not "interested persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940
Act (the "Independent Trustees"), are required to annually review and re-approve
the terms of the Fund's existing investment advisory agreement and approve any
newly proposed terms therein. In this regard, the Board reviewed and
re-approved, during the most recent six month period covered by this report, the
investment management agreement (the "Management Agreement") with Advent Capital
Management, LLC ("Advent") for the Fund.

More specifically, at a meeting held on March 31, 2009, the Board, including the
Independent Trustees advised by their independent legal counsel, considered the
factors and reached the conclusions described below relating to the re-approval
of the Management Agreement.


NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

The Board received and considered various data and information regarding the
nature, extent and quality of services provided to the Fund by Advent under the
Management Agreement. The Board reviewed and analyzed the responses of Advent to
a detailed series of requests submitted by the Independent Trustees' independent
legal counsel on behalf of such Trustees which included, among other things,
information about the background and experience of the senior management and the
expertise of, and amount of attention devoted to the Fund by, personnel of
Advent. In this regard, the Board specifically reviewed the qualifications,
background and responsibilities of the officers primarily responsible for
day-to-day portfolio management services for the Fund.

The Board evaluated the ability of Advent, including their resources, reputation
and other attributes, to attract and retain highly qualified investment
professionals, including research, advisory and supervisory personnel. In this
connection, the Board considered information regarding the compensation
structures for the personnel of Advent involved in the management of the Fund.

Based on the above factors, together with those referenced below, the Board
concluded that it was satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the
investment management services provided to the Fund by Advent.


FUND PERFORMANCE AND EXPENSES

The Board considered the performance results for the Fund on a market price and
net asset value basis over various time periods. They also considered these
results in comparison to the performance results of a group of other closed-end
funds that was determined to be the most similar to the Fund in terms of
investment strategy ("Peer Group").

The Board received and considered statistical information regarding the Fund's
total expense ratios (based on net assets applicable to common shares) and their
various components. They also considered comparisons of these expenses to the
expense information for the Fund's Peer Group.

Based on the above-referenced considerations and other factors, the Board
concluded that the overall performance results and expense comparison supported
the re-approval of the Investment Management Agreement.


INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE RATES

The Board reviewed and considered the contractual investment management fee
rates for the Fund ("Management Agreement Rate") payable by the Fund to Advent
for investment management and advisory services. In addition, the Board reviewed
and considered all fee waiver arrangements applicable to the Management
Agreement Rate and considered the Management Agreement Rate after taking all
applicable waivers into account (the "Net Management Rate").

Additionally, the Board received and considered information comparing the
Management Agreement Rate (on a stand-alone basis exclusive of service
fee/administrative fee rates) with those of the other funds in the Peer Group.
The advisory fee paid on managed assets was below the median of the Peer Group
due to fee waivers in effect. The expense ratio on common assets for the Fund
(excluding interest expenses) was at the median on a gross basis and below the
median on a net basis. These comparisons were also affected by fee waivers by
peer funds and potentially by the extent of leverage. The Board also took note
of the fact that the expense ratios of the Peer Group funds may have increased
since the date as of which the information was presented, given the level of
market declines in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. The
Board concluded that the fees were fair and equitable based on relevant factors,
including the Fund's performance results and total expenses ranking relative to
its Peer Group.


PROFITABILITY

The Board received and considered an estimated profitability analysis of Advent
based on the Net Management Rates. The Board concluded that, in light of the
costs of providing investment management services to the Fund, the profits and
other ancillary benefits that Advent received with regard to providing these
services to the Fund were not unreasonable.


ECONOMIES OF SCALE

The Board received and considered information regarding whether there have been
economies of scale with respect to the management of the Fund, whether the Fund
has appropriately benefited from any economies of scale, and whether there is
potential for realization of any further economies of scale. The Board concluded
that the opportunity to benefit from economies of scale were diminished in the
context of closed-end funds.


INFORMATION ABOUT SERVICES TO OTHER CLIENTS

The Board also received and considered information about the nature, extent and
quality of services and fee rates offered by Advent to its other clients.

After considering the above-described factors and based on the deliberations and
their evaluation of the information provided to them, the Board concluded that
re-approval of the Management Agreement was in the best interest of the Fund and
its shareholders. Accordingly, the Board unanimously re-approved the Management
Agreement.
