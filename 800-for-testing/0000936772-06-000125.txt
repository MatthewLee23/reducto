Semi-Annual Report

This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund (the "Fund") for the semi-annual reporting
period ended April 30, 2006. The Fund is a closed-end fund that trades under
the New York Stock Exchange symbol "AFB".

Investment Objective and Policies

The Fund is a closed-end management investment company that seeks to provide
high current income exempt from regular federal income tax by investing
substantially all of its net assets in municipal securities that pay interest
that is exempt from federal income tax. The Fund will normally invest at least
80% of its net assets in municipal securities paying interest that is exempt
from regular federal income tax. The Fund also normally will invest at least
75% of its assets in investment-grade municipal securities or unrated municipal
securities considered to be of comparable quality. The Fund may invest up to
25% of its net assets in municipal bonds rated below investment grade and
unrated municipal bonds considered to be of comparable quality as determined by
the Fund's investment adviser. The Fund intends to invest primarily in
municipal securities that pay interest that is not subject to the federal
Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT"), but may invest without limit in municipal
securities paying interest that is subject to the federal AMT. For more
information regarding the Fund's risks, please see "A Word About Risk" on page
3 and "Note G--Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund" of the Notes to
Financial Statements on page 26.

Investment Results

The table on page 4 provides performance data for the Fund and its benchmark,
the Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index, for the six- and 12-month periods
ended April 30, 2006.

The Fund outperformed its benchmark, the LB Municipal Index, during both the
six- and 12-month periods ended April 30, 2006. The Fund's stronger relative
performance during the six-month period under review was largely the result of
security selection in the insured, pre-refunded and special tax sectors. In
addition, the Fund's leveraged structure aided its performance.

Market Review and Investment Strategy

From April 2005 through the end of April 2006, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the
"Fed") raised the target for the Federal funds rate from 2.75% to 4.75%; 0.75%
of that increase was since October 2005. In response to the Fed's actions, the
yields for most maturities of domestic bonds increased. Municipal bond yields
increased less than U.S. Treasury bond yields. For example, during the
six-month reporting period, 10-year municipal yields increased 0.16% and
30-year municipal yields actually declined 0.06%. Over the same time period,
10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yields rose 0.50% and 0.46%,
respectively. The outperformance for municipal bonds largely resulted from
relatively light supply--the amount of bonds issued in the first quarter of
2006 was down 29% from the first quarter of 2005. Municipal bond prices have
also


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 1


been supported by ongoing demand from a diverse set of investors including
traditional buyers such as U.S. individuals, as well as relatively newer
municipal market participants, such as hedge funds and other institutional
leveraged investors. The municipal market showed similar relative performance
over the 12-month period as over the six-month period ended April 30, 2006. For
the 12-month period, despite 10-year U.S. Treasury yields increasing 0.85% and
30-year U.S. Treasury yields increasing 0.66%, 10-year and 30-year municipal
yields rose 0.51% and 0.16%, respectively.

The market for lower-credit quality, or high yield, municipal bonds continues
to post even stronger returns than the general municipal market. The LB High
Yield Municipal Index returned 5.23% and 7.46% over the six- and 12-month
periods ended April 30, 2006, respectively. This compares to 1.56% and 2.16%
for the same periods for the LB Municipal Bond Index, which represents the
overall general market for investment-grade municipal bonds. The strong
performance for lower-credit quality municipal bonds was in part due to the
relatively favorable credit environment, but of more importance, due to the
continued, very strong demand for higher-yielding bonds. According to AMG Data,
a provider of mutual fund money flow and holdings data, new money into high
yield municipal bond mutual funds accounted for approximately 40% of the flow
in municipal bond mutual funds during the first quarter of 2006. By comparison,
high yield bonds currently represent about 4% of the outstanding supply of
municipal bonds.

During the past year, the Municipal Bond Investment Team's (the "team's")
strategy has remained consistent. Given that interest rates are still
relatively low compared to the level of inflation, the team continues to
maintain less interest rate exposure in the Fund relative to that of the Fund's
benchmark. Also, because high yield municipals have displayed such strong
performance, the team has reduced the Fund's exposure to such holdings, and
further diversified the Fund's remaining holdings. Recently, as market
conditions allow, the team has also been selling longer-maturity holdings and
replacing them with bonds with shorter maturities. In the team's view, these
shorter-maturity holdings should outperform longer-maturity bonds if rates rise
and the difference between long and short yields increases.

Fund, please see page 42.

Benchmark Disclosure

The unmanaged Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index does not reflect fees and
expenses associated with the active management of a mutual fund portfolio. The
Index is a total return performance benchmark for the long-term, investment
grade, tax-exempt bond market. An investor cannot invest directly in an index,
and its results are not indicative of the performance for any specific
investment, including the Fund.

A Word About Risk

Among the risks of investing in the Fund are changes in the general level of
interest rates or changes in bond credit quality ratings. Changes in interest
rates have a greater effect on bonds with longer maturities than on those with
shorter maturities. Please note, as interest rates rise, existing bond prices
fall and can cause the value of your investment in the Fund to decline. While
the Fund invests principally in bonds and other fixed-income securities, in
order to achieve its investment objectives, the Fund may at times use certain
types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater
than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. At the discretion of
the Fund's Adviser, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in
municipal bonds that are rated below investment grade ("junk bonds"). These
securities involve greater volatility and risk than higher-quality fixed-income
securities.

The issuance of the Fund's preferred stock results in leveraging of the Common
Stock, an investment technique usually considered speculative. Leverage creates
certain risks for holders of Common Stock, including higher volatility of both
the net asset value and market value of the Common Stock, and fluctuations in
the dividend rates on the preferred stock will affect the return to holders of
Common Stock. If the Fund were fully invested in longer-term securities and if
short-term interest rates were to increase, then the amount of dividends paid
on the preferred shares would increase and both net investment income available
for distribution to the holders of Common Stock and the net asset value of the
Common Stock would decline. At the same time, the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock (that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may,
as a result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common
Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the price of the
portfolio's investments, since the value of the Fund's Preferred Stock does not
fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net asset value, the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock may also decline.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2006 (unaudited)

NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), was incorporated in
the state of Maryland on November 9, 2001 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which requires management to
make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation

Portfolio securities are valued at their current market value determined on the
basis of market quotations or, if market quotations are not readily available
or are deemed unreliable, at "fair value" as determined in accordance with
procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's Board
of Directors.

In general, the market value of securities which are readily available and
deemed reliable are determined as follows. Securities listed on a national
securities exchange or on a foreign securities exchange are valued at the last
sale price at the close of the exchange or foreign securities exchange. If
there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices on such day. Securities listed on more than
one exchange are valued by reference to the principal exchange on which the
securities are traded; securities not listed on an exchange but traded on The
NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued in accordance with the NASDAQ
Official Closing Price; listed put or call options are valued at the last sale
price. If there has been no sale on that day, such securities will be valued at
the closing bid prices on that day; open futures contracts and options thereon
are valued using the closing settlement price or, in the absence of such a
price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are no quotations available
for the day of valuation, the last available closing settlement price is used;
securities traded in the over-the-counter market, ("OTC") (but excluding
securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of the current bid and
asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable
sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt instruments having 60 days
or less remaining until maturity are valued at amortized cost if their original
maturity was 60 days or less; or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st
day prior to maturity if their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days;
fixed-income securities, including mortgage backed and asset backed securities,
may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a
price obtained from one or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 21


broker/dealer quotes are obtained, AllianceBernstein L.P. (prior to February
24, 2006 known as Alliance Capital Management L.P.) (the "Adviser") may
establish procedures whereby changes in market yields or spreads are used to
adjust, on a daily basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a security; and
OTC and other derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or
spread from a major broker/dealer in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available (including
restricted securities) or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value.
Factors considered in making this determination may include, but are not
limited to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, analysis
of the issuer's financial statements or other available documents. In addition,
the Fund may use fair value pricing for securities primarily traded in non-U.S.
markets because, most foreign markets close well before the Fund values its
securities at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The earlier close of these foreign
markets gives rise to the possibility that significant events, including broad
market moves, may have occurred in the interim and may materially affect the
value of those securities.

2. Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions

Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the trade date the securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and
losses are determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums
and accretes original issue discounts and market discounts as adjustments to
interest income.

4. Dividends and Distributions

Dividends and distributions to shareholders, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gains distributions are
determined in accordance with federal tax regulations and may differ from those
determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To
the extent these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment;
temporary differences do not require such reclassification.

NOTE B
Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of .65 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net
assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders. Such fee is accrued
daily


22 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


and paid monthly. The Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its
fees or reimburse the Fund for expenses in the amount of 0.25% of the Fund's
average daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders for
the first 5 full years of the Fund's operations, 0.20% of the Fund's average
daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders in year 6,
0.15% in year 7, 0.10% in year 8, and 0.05% in year 9. For the six months ended
April 30, 2006, which is year 5 of operations, the amount of such fees waived
was $633,490.

Under the terms of a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with
AllianceBernstein Investor Services, Inc. (prior to February 24, 2006 known as
Alliance Global Investor Services, Inc.) ("ABIS"), an affiliate of the Adviser,
the Fund reimburses ABIS for costs relating to servicing phone inquiries for
the Fund.During the six months ended April 30, 2006, there was no reimbursement
paid to ABIS.

NOTE C
Investment Transactions

Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the six months ended April 30, 2006, were as follows:

                                                    Purchases        Sales
                                                  ------------   ------------
Investment securities (excluding
   U.S. government securities)                    $ 23,672,686   $ 23,201,365
U.S. government securities                                  -0-            -0-

The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes was substantially the
same as the cost for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, gross
unrealized appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap
transactions) are as follows:

Gross unrealized appreciation                                    $ 22,072,225
Gross unrealized depreciation                                        (534,179)
                                                                 ------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                      $ 21,538,046
                                                                 ============

1. Swap Agreements

The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and
credit risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates
two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based
upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a
specified amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted
against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment
to be received


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 23


by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the contract.
Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each counterparty to a
swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk. Additionally, risks may
arise from unanticipated movements in interest rates or in the value of the
underlying securities.

As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. The Fund accrues for the interim payments on
swap contracts on a daily basis, with the net amount recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts on the statement of assets and
liabilities. Once the interim payments are settled in cash, the net amount is
recorded as realized gain/loss on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss
recorded upon the termination of swap contracts on the statement of operations.
Prior to November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within
interest income/expense in the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the
value of swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of investments.

2. Financial Futures Contracts

The Fund may buy or sell financial futures contracts for the purpose of hedging
the portfolio against adverse effects of anticipated movements in the market.
The Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in the value of these
financial instruments and the imperfect correlation between movements in the
price of the futures contracts and movements in the price of the securities
hedged or used for cover.

At the time the Fund enters into a futures contract, the Fund deposits and
maintains as collateral an initial margin with the broker, as required by the
exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the
Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the
daily fluctuation in the value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are
known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or
losses. Risks may arise from the potential inability of the counterparty to
meet the terms of the contract. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract
at the time it was opened and the time it was closed.

NOTE D
Common Stock

There are 20,491,401 shares of common stock outstanding at April 30, 2006.
During the six months ended April 30, 2006, the Fund issued 19,734 shares in
connection with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. During the year ended
October 31, 2005, the Fund did not issue any shares in connection with the
Fund's reinvestment plan.

NOTE E

Preferred Stock, consisting of 1,950 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series
W and Series TH. The preferred shares have a liquidation value of $25,000 per
share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends. The dividend rate on the Auction
Preferred Stock may change generally every 7 days as set by the auction agent
for Series M, T, W and TH. The dividend rate on the Series M is 3.60% effective

through May 2, 2006. The dividend rate on the Series W is 3.60% effective
through May 3, 2006. The dividend rate on the Series TH is 3.72% effective
through May 4, 2006.

At certain times, the Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund, in whole or
in part, at $25,000 per share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends.

Although the Fund will not ordinarily redeem the Preferred Shares, it may be
required to redeem shares if, for example, the Fund does not meet an asset
coverage ratio required by law or to correct a failure to meet a rating agency
guideline in a timely manner. The Fund voluntarily may redeem the Preferred
Shares in certain circumstances.

The Preferred Shareholders, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect
at least two Directors at all times and to elect a majority of the Directors in
the event two years' dividends on the Preferred Shares are unpaid. In each
case, the remaining Directors will be elected by the Common Shareholders and
Preferred Shareholders voting together as a single class. The Preferred
Shareholders will vote as a separate class on certain other matters as required
under the Fund's Charter, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Maryland law.

As of October 31, 2005, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit)
applicable to common shareholders on a tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed tax exempt income                   $  3,739,296
Accumulated capital and other losses                (1,454,343)(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)              22,209,130(b)
                                                  ------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)              $ 24,494,083(c)
                                                  ------------

(a)   On October 31, 2005, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
$1,454,343 of which $1,444,137 expires in the year 2011, and $10,206 expires in
the year 2012. To the extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss
carryforward, such gains will not be distributed. During the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2005, the Fund utilized capital loss carryforwards of $2,385,306.

(b)   The differences between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) are attributed primarily to the difference between
the book and tax treatment of swap income and the realization for tax purposes
of gain/losses on certain derivative instruments.

(c)   The difference between book-basis and tax-basis components of accumulated
earnings/(deficit) is attributable primarily to dividends payable.

NOTE G
Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

Indemnification Risk--In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

NOTE H
Legal Proceedings

As has been previously reported, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General ("NYAG")
have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry identified as
"market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain other
regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into these
practices within the industry and have requested that the Adviser provide
information


26 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


to them. The Adviser has been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with
all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the
Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by the market.
Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the market timing
and late trading practices that are the subject of the investigations mentioned
above or the lawsuits described below. Please see below for a description of
the agreements reached by the Adviser and the SEC and NYAG in connection with
the investigations mentioned above.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the Adviser and certain other
defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on or related to
the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG investigations
referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a party. The
lawsuits are now pending in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland pursuant to a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferring and centralizing all of the mutual funds involving
market and late trading in the District of Maryland (the "Mutual Fund MDL").
Management of the Adviser believes that these private lawsuits are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial
condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, the Adviser confirmed that it had reached terms with the
SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is memorialized in an
Assurance of Discontinuation dated September 1, 2004 ("NYAGOrder"). Among the
key provisions of these agreements are the following:

(i)     The Adviser agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the "Reimbursement
Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse effects of market
timing attributable to market timing relationships described in the SEC Order.
According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be paid, in order of
priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share of losses suffered
by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate share of advisory
fees paid by such fund during the period of such market timing;

(ii)    The Adviser agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some of
the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing January 1,
2004, for a period of at least five years; and

(iii)   The Adviser agreed to implement changes to its governance and
compliance procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that the
Adviser's registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will
introduce governance and compliance changes.


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 27


The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

On February 10, 2004, the Adviser received (i) a subpoena duces tecum from the
Office of the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia and (ii) a request
for information from West Virginia's Office of the State Auditor, Securities
Commission (the "West Virginia Securities Commissioner") (together, the
"Information Requests"). Both Information Requests require the Adviser to
produce documents concerning, among other things, any market timing or late
trading in the Adviser's sponsored mutual funds. The Adviser responded to the
Information Requests and has been cooperating fully with the investigation.

On April 11, 2005, a complaint entitled The Attorney General of the State of
West Virginia v. AIM Advisors, Inc., et al. ("WVAG Complaint") was filed
against the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P. ("Alliance
Holding"), and various other defendants not affiliated with the Adviser. The
WVAG Complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia
by the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia. The WVAG Complaint makes
factual allegations generally similar to those in certain of the complaints
related to the lawsuits discussed above. On October 19, 2005, the WVAG
Complaint was transferred to the Mutual Fund MDL.

On August 30, 2005, the deputy commissioner of securities of the West Virginia
Securities Commissioner signed a Summary Order to Cease and Desist, and Notice
of Right to Hearing addressed to the Adviser and Alliance Holding. The Summary
Order claims that the Adviser and Alliance Holding violated the West Virginia
Uniform Securities Act, and makes factual allegations generally similar to
those in the SEC Order and the NYAG Order. On January 26, 2006, the Adviser,
Alliance Holding, and various unaffiliated defendants filed a Petition for Writ
of Prohibition and Order Suspending Proceedings in West Virginia state court
seeking to vacate the Summary Order and for other relief. On April 12, 2006,
respondents' petition was denied. On May 4, 2006, respondents appealed the
court's determination.

On June 22, 2004, a purported class action complaint entitled Aucoin, et al. v.
Alliance Capital Management L.P., et al. ("Aucoin Complaint") was filed against
the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P., Alliance Capital
Management Corporation, AXA Financial, Inc., AllianceBernstein Investment
Research & Management, Inc., certain current and former directors of the
AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and unnamed Doe defendants. The Aucoin
Complaint names certain of the AllianceBernstein mutual funds as nominal


28 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


defendants. The Fund was not named as a defendant in the Aucoin Complaint. The
Aucoin Complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York by alleged shareholders of an AllianceBernstein mutual
fund. The Aucoin Complaint alleges, among other things, (i) that certain of the
defendants improperly authorized the payment of excessive commissions and other
fees from fund assets to broker-dealers in exchange for preferential marketing
services, (ii) that certain of the defendants misrepresented and omitted from
registration statements and other reports material facts concerning such
payments, and (iii) that certain defendants caused such conduct as control
persons of other defendants. The Aucoin Complaint asserts claims for violation
of Sections 34(b), 36(b) and 48(a) of the Investment Company Act, Sections 206
and 215 of the Advisers Act, breach of common law fiduciary duties, and aiding
and abetting breaches of common law fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages and punitive damages, rescission of
their contracts with the Adviser, including recovery of all fees paid to the
Adviser pursuant to such contracts, an accounting of all fund-related fees,
commissions and soft dollar payments, and restitution of all unlawfully or
discriminatorily obtained fees and expenses.

Since June 22, 2004, nine additional lawsuits making factual allegations
substantially similar to those in the Aucoin Complaint were filed against the
Adviser and certain other defendants. All nine of the lawsuits (i) were brought
as class actions filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, (ii) assert claims substantially identical to the Aucoin
Complaint, and (iii) are brought on behalf of shareholders of the Funds.

On February 2, 2005, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended class action
complaint ("Aucoin Consolidated Amended Complaint") that asserts claims
substantially similar to the Aucoin Complaint and the nine additional lawsuits
referenced above. On October 19, 2005, the District Court dismissed each of the
claims set forth in the Aucoin Consolidated Amended Complaint, except for
plaintiffs' claim under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act. On January
11, 2006, the District Court granted defendants' motion for reconsideration and
dismissed the remaining Section 36(b) claim. On May 31, 2006 the District Court
denied plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint.

The Adviser believes that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Fund or the Adviser's ability to perform advisory
services relating to the Fund.

(a)    As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting
for interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected within
net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however, prior to
November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense on the statement of operations. For the year ended October 31,
2004, the effect of this change to the net investment income and the net
realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment transactions was less than
$0.01 per share and the ratio of net investment income to average net assets
was .00%.

(b)    Commencement of operations. Net asset value immediately after the
closing of the first public offering was $14.30.

(c)    Based on average shares outstanding.

(d)    Net of fees waived by the Adviser.

(e)    Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common
stock on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day
of the period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to net asset value from the beginning to the
end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of the
period. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one year
is not annualized.

(f)    These expense and net investment income ratios do not reflect the effect
of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(g)    Annualized.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 33


Information Regarding the Review and Approval of the Fund's Advisory Agreement

The Fund's disinterested directors (the "directors") unanimously approved the
continuance of the Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the Adviser at a
meeting held on December 14, 2005.

In preparation for the meeting, the directors had requested from the Adviser
and received and evaluated extensive materials, including performance and
expense information for other investment companies with similar investment
objectives as the Fund derived from data compiled by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"),
which is not affiliated with the Adviser. Prior to voting, the directors
reviewed the proposed continuance of the Advisory Agreement with management and
with experienced counsel who are independent of the Adviser and received a
memorandum from such counsel discussing the legal standards for their
consideration of the proposed continuance. The directors also discussed the
proposed continuance in four private sessions at which only the directors,
their independent counsel and the Fund's Independent Compliance Officer were
present. In reaching their determinations relating to continuance of the
Advisory Agreement, the directors considered all factors they believed
relevant, including the following:

    1.    information comparing the performance of the Fund to other investment
companies with similar investment objectives and to an index;

    2.    the nature, extent and quality of investment, compliance,
administrative and other services rendered by the Adviser;

    3.    payments received by the Adviser from all sources in respect of the
Fund and all investment companies in the AllianceBernstein Funds complex;

    4.    the costs borne by, and profitability of, the Adviser and its
affiliates in providing services to the Fund and to all investment companies in
the AllianceBernstein Funds complex;

    5.    comparative fee and expense data for the Fund and other investment
companies with similar investment objectives;

    6.    the extent to which economies of scale would be realized to the
extent the Fund grows and whether fee levels reflect any economies of scale for
the benefit of investors;

    7.    the Adviser's policies and practices regarding allocation of
portfolio transactions of the Fund, including the extent to which the Adviser
benefits from soft dollar arrangements;


34 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


    8.    portfolio turnover rates for the Fund compared to other investment
companies with similar investment objectives;

    9.    fall-out benefits that the Adviser and its affiliates receive from
their relationships with the Fund;

    10.   the Adviser's representation that there are no institutional products
managed by the Adviser which have a substantially similar investment style as
the Fund;

    11.   the professional experience and qualifications of the Fund's
portfolio management team and other senior personnel of the Adviser; and

    12.   the terms of the Advisory Agreement.

The directors also considered their knowledge of the nature and quality of the
services provided by the Adviser to the Fund gained from their experience as
directors or trustees of most of the registered investment companies advised by
the Adviser, their overall confidence in the Adviser's integrity and competence
they have gained from that experience and the Adviser's responsiveness to
concerns raised by them in the past, including the Adviser's willingness to
consider and implement organizational and operational changes designed to
improve investment results and the services provided to the AllianceBernstein
Funds.

In their deliberations, the directors did not identify any particular
information that was all-important or controlling, and the directors attributed
different weights to the various factors.

The directors determined that the overall arrangements between the Fund and the
Adviser, as provided in the Advisory Agreement, were fair and reasonable in
light of the services performed, expenses incurred and such other matters as
the directors considered relevant in the exercise of their business judgment.

The material factors and conclusions that formed the basis for the directors
reaching their determinations to approve the continuance of the Advisory
Agreement, including their determinations that the Adviser should continue to
be the investment adviser for the Fund and that the fees payable to the Adviser
pursuant to the Advisory Agreement are appropriate, were separately discussed
by the directors.

Nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Adviser

The directors noted that, under the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser, subject to
the oversight of the directors, administers the Fund's business and other
affairs. The Adviser manages the investment of the assets of the Fund,
including making purchases and sales of portfolio securities consistent with
the Fund's investment


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 35


objective and policies. The Adviser also provides the Fund with such office
space, administrative and other services (exclusive of, and in addition to, any
such services provided by any others retained by the Fund) and executive and
other personnel as are necessary for the Fund's operations. The Adviser pays
all of the compensation of directors of the Fund who are affiliated persons of
the Adviser and of the officers of the Fund.

The directors also considered that a provision in the Advisory Agreement for
the Fund provides that the Fund will reimburse the Adviser for the cost of
certain clerical, accounting, administrative and other services provided at the
Fund's request by employees of the Adviser or its affiliates. The directors
noted that no reimbursements had been made to date by the Fund to the Adviser
as no requests for such reimbursements had been made. Requests for these "at no
more than cost" reimbursements are approved by the directors on a quarterly
basis for most of the open-end AllianceBernstein funds and result in a higher
rate of total compensation from the funds to the Adviser than the stated fee
rates in the funds' advisory agreements.

The directors considered the scope and quality of services provided by the
Adviser under the Advisory Agreement and noted that the scope of services
provided by advisers had expanded over time as a result of regulatory and other
developments. The directors noted, for example, that the Adviser is responsible
for maintaining and monitoring its own and, to varying degrees, the Fund's
compliance programs, and that these compliance programs have recently been
refined and enhanced in light of new regulatory requirements. The directors
considered the quality of the in-house investment research capabilities of the
Adviser and the other resources it has dedicated to performing services for the
Fund. The quality of administrative and other services, including the Adviser's
role in coordinating the activities of the Fund's other service providers, also
were considered. The directors also considered the Adviser's response to recent
regulatory compliance issues affecting a number of the investment companies in
the AllianceBernstein Funds complex. The directors concluded that, overall,
they were satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of services provided to
the Fund under the Advisory Agreement.

Costs of Services Provided and Profitability to the Adviser

The directors reviewed a schedule of the revenues, expenses and related notes
indicating the profitability of the Fund to the Adviser for calendar years 2003
and 2004. The directors also reviewed information in respect of 2004 that had
been prepared with an updated expense allocation methodology. The directors
noted that the updated expense allocation methodology would be used to prepare
profitability information for 2005, and that it differed in various respects
from the methodology used in prior years. The directors reviewed the
assumptions and methods of allocation used by the Adviser in preparing
fund-specific profitability data, and noted the Adviser's representation to
them that it believed that the


36 o Alliance National Municipal Income Fund


methods of allocation used in preparing the profitability information were
reasonable and appropriate and that the Adviser had previously discussed with
the directors that there is no generally accepted allocation methodology for
information of this type.

The directors recognized that it is difficult to make comparisons of
profitability from fund advisory contracts because comparative information is
not generally publicly available and is affected by numerous factors, including
the structure of the particular adviser, the types of funds it manages, its
business mix, numerous assumptions regarding allocations and the adviser's
capital structure and cost of capital. In considering profitability
information, the directors considered the effect of fall-out benefits on the
Adviser's expenses. The directors focused on the profitability of the Adviser's
relationship with the Fund before taxes. The directors recognized that the
Adviser should generally be entitled to earn a reasonable level of profits for
the services it provides to the Fund and, based on their review, concluded that
they were satisfied that the Adviser's level of profitability from its
relationship with the Fund was not excessive.

Fall-Out Benefits

The directors considered that the Adviser benefits from soft dollar
arrangements whereby it receives brokerage and research services from many of
the brokers and dealers that execute purchases and sales of securities on
behalf of its clients on an agency basis. The directors noted that since the
Fund does not engage in brokerage transactions, the Adviser does not receive
soft dollar benefits in respect of portfolio transactions of the Fund. The
directors also noted that a subsidiary of the Adviser provides certain
shareholder services to the Fund and receives compensation from the Fund for
such services.

The directors recognized that the Adviser's profitability would be somewhat
lower if the Adviser's subsidiary did not receive the benefits described above.
The directors understood that the Adviser also might derive reputational and
other benefits from its association with the Fund.

Investment Results

In addition to the information reviewed by the directors in connection with the
meeting, the directors receive detailed comparative performance information for
the Fund at each regular Board meeting during the year. At the meeting, the
directors reviewed information prepared by Lipper showing performance of the
Fund as compared to a group of 15 funds in its Lipper category selected by
Lipper (the "Performance Group") for periods ended September 30, 2005 over the
1- and 3-year periods. Performance information for a larger universe of funds
in its Lipper category selected by Lipper was not provided by Lipper in light
of the relatively small size of the Fund's Lipper category. The directors also
reviewed information prepared by the Adviser showing performance of the Fund as
compared to the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index (the "Index") for


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 37


periods ended September 30, 2005 over the year to date ("YTD"), 1- and 3-year
and since inception periods (January 2002 inception). The directors noted that
in the Performance Group comparison the Fund was in the 2nd quintile in the
1-year period and in the 3rd quintile in the 3-year period. The directors
further noted that the Fund significantly outperformed the Index in all periods
reviewed. The directors noted that the Fund utilizes leverage whereas the Index
is not leveraged. Based on their review, the directors concluded that the
Fund's relative performance over time was satisfactory.

Advisory Fees and Other Expenses

The directors considered the latest fiscal period actual advisory fees paid by
the Fund to the Adviser and information prepared by Lipper concerning fee rates
paid by other funds in the same Lipper category as the Fund. The directors also
took into account their general knowledge of advisory fees paid by open-end and
closed-end funds that invest in fixed-income municipal securities. The
directors recognized that it is difficult to make comparisons of advisory fees
because there are variations in the services that are included in the fees paid
by other funds.

The directors noted that in connection with the settlement of the market timing
matter with the New York Attorney General, the Adviser agreed to material
reductions (averaging 20%) in the fee schedules of most of the open-end funds
sponsored by the Adviser (other than money market funds). As a result of that
settlement, the Adviser's fees (i) for managing open-end high income funds are
..50% of the first $2.5 billion of average daily net assets, .45% for average
daily net assets over that level to $5 billion, and .40% for average daily net
assets over $5 billion; and (ii) for managing open-end low risk income funds
are .45% of the first $2.5 billion of average daily net assets, .40% for
average daily net assets over that level to $5 billion, and .35% for average
daily net assets over $5 billion. The directors noted that each of these fee
schedules, if applied to the Fund, would result in a lower fee rate than that
paid by the Fund pursuant to the Advisory Agreement.

The Adviser informed the directors that there are no institutional products
offered by it that have a substantially similar investment style as the Fund.
The directors reviewed information in the Adviser's Form ADV and noted that it
charges institutional clients lower fees for advising comparably sized accounts
using strategies that differ from those of the Fund but which involve
investments in securities of the same type that the Fund invests in (i.e.,
fixed income municipal). They had previously received an oral presentation from
the Adviser that supplemented the information in the Form ADV.

The Adviser reviewed with the directors the significant differences in the
scope of services it provides to institutional clients and to the Fund. For
example, the Advisory Agreement requires the Adviser to provide, in addition to
investment


38 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


advice, office facilities and officers (including officers to provide required
certifications). The Adviser also coordinates the provision of services to the
Fund by non-affiliated service providers and is responsible for the
compensation of the Fund's Independent Compliance Officer and certain related
expenses. The provision of these non-advisory services involves costs and
exposure to liability. The Adviser explained that many of these services
normally are not provided to non-investment company clients and that fees
charged to the Fund reflect the costs and risks of the additional obligations.
In light of these facts, the directors did not place significant weight on
these fee comparisons.

The directors noted that at their December 14-16, 2004 meetings, the directors
had requested a reduction in the advisory fees of the Fund to the levels in
accordance with the fee schedules for open-end funds and deferred renewal of
the Fund's Advisory Agreement pending receipt and consideration of their
request by the Adviser. At their February 7-10, 2005 meeting, the directors
considered the adviser's position that no fee adjustments were warranted.

The directors also considered the total expense ratio of the Fund in comparison
to the fees and expenses of funds within two comparison groups created by
Lipper: an Expense Group and an Expense Universe. Lipper described an Expense
Group as a representative sample of comparable funds and an Expense Universe as
a broader group, consisting of all funds in the Fund's investment
classification/ objective with a similar load type as the Fund. The expense
ratio of the Fund was based on the Fund's latest fiscal year expense ratio. The
directors recognized that the expense ratio information for the Fund
potentially reflected on the Adviser's provision of services, as the Adviser is
responsible for coordinating services provided to the Fund by others. The
directors noted that it was likely that the expense ratios of some funds in the
Fund's Lipper category were lowered by waivers or reimbursements by those
funds' investment advisers, which in some cases were voluntary and perhaps
temporary.

The information reviewed by the directors showed that the Fund's latest fiscal
period actual advisory fees of 65.0 basis points was significantly lower than
the medians for the Expense Group and Expense Universe. The directors noted
that Lipper calculates the fee rate based on the Fund's net assets attributable
to common stockholders, whereas the Fund's Advisory Agreement provides that
fees are computed based on average daily net assets (i.e., including assets
supported by the Fund's preferred stock). The directors also noted that the
Fund's fee rate reflects a fee waiver arrangement that provides for the waiver
amount to be gradually reduced over four years commencing after the fifth full
year of operations of the Fund, and that the Fund commenced operations in
January 2002. The directors further noted that the Fund's expense ratio was
significantly lower than the Expense Group median and materially lower than the
Expense Universe median. The directors concluded that the Fund's expense ratio
was satisfactory.


ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 39


Economies of Scale

The directors considered that the Fund is a closed-end fund and that it was not
expected to have meaningful asset growth as a result. In such circumstances,
the directors did not view the potential for realization of economies of scale
as the Fund's assets grow to be a material factor in their deliberations. The
directors noted that if the Fund's net assets were to increase materially as a
result of, e.g., an acquisition or rights offering, they would review whether
potential economies of scale would be realized.
