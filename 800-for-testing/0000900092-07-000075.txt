BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. seeks to provide
shareholders with current income and capital appreciation. The Fund seeks
to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of equity
and debt securities of U.S. and foreign issuers.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to
shareholders of BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. for their
information. It is not a prospectus. The Fund leverages its Common Stock to
provide Common Stock shareholders with a potentially higher rate of return.
Leverage creates risk for Common Stock shareholders, including the likelihood
of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of Common Stock
shares, and the risk that fluctuations in short-term interest rates may reduce
the Common Stock's yield. Past performance results shown in this report should
not be considered a representation of future performance. Statements and other
information herein are as dated and are subject to change.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging through
borrowings or issuance of short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred
Stock. The concept of leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of
assets to be obtained from leverage will be based on short-term interest or
dividend rates, which normally will be lower than the income earned by the
Fund on its longer-term portfolio investments. To the extent that the total
assets of the Fund (including the assets obtained from leverage) are invested
in higher-yielding portfolio investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders
are the beneficiaries of the incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend
rates on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue the Preferred Stock)
may reduce the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value
and market price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets
received from leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income
will be greater than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income
from the securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage,
the Fund's net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and
therefore the amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders
will be reduced.


Share Repurchase Program


On February 17, 2006, the Board of Directors of Capital and Income Strategies
Fund, Inc. (CII--the "Fund") authorized the Fund, at the discretion of the
Fund officers, to engage in periodic open market repurchases of up to 5% of
the Fund's outstanding Common Stock. As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 641,500 shares, representing 5% of the outstanding
shares as of April 28, 2006. The shares were repurchased at a weighted average
price, including transaction costs, of $18.145, which was 17.5% below the
average daily net asset value of $21.99 for the period during the repurchase.

A Letter to Shareholders


Dear Shareholder

As 2007 begins, we are able to look back on 2006 as a volatile, but ultimately,
a positive year for most major markets. Returns for the annual and semi-annual
periods ended December 31, 2006, were as follows:


<TABLE>

<S>                                                                            <C>            <C>

High yield bonds (Credit Suisse High Yield Index)                              + 8.14         +11.92
</TABLE>


After raising the target short-term interest rate 17 times between June 2004
and June 2006, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) finally opted to pause on
August 8, 2006. This left the federal funds rate at 5.25%, where it remained
through year-end. In interrupting its two-year interest rate-hiking campaign,
the Fed acknowledged that economic growth is slowing, led by a downturn in the
housing market, but has maintained a cautionary view on inflation.

Overall, it was a good 12 months for U.S. equities, despite a significant
correction in the middle of the year that was largely triggered by rising
interest rates, inflation fears, elevated oil prices and geopolitical
uncertainties. Nevertheless, strong corporate earnings, abundant liquidity and
record merger-and-acquisition activity provided a solid backdrop for stocks.
Many international equity markets (with the notable exception of Japan)
performed even better, outpacing U.S. stocks for the fifth consecutive year.
Strength was especially notable in European equities and select emerging
markets.

Bonds experienced a more modest annual return than stocks. Interest rates and
bond yields moved higher for much of the year as bond prices, which move
opposite of yields, declined. Prices began to improve in the summer as the
economy showed signs of weakening and the Fed paused. Notably, the Treasury
curve remained inverted for much of 2006. The 10-year Treasury yield ended
December at 4.71%, well below the federal funds rate.

As we begin a new year, investors are left with a few key questions: Will the
U.S. economy achieve a soft landing, will the Fed reverse its prior policy and
cut interest rates, and how might these outcomes impact the investment
climate. As you navigate the uncertainties inherent in the financial markets,
we encourage you to start the year by reviewing your investment goals with
your financial professional and making portfolio changes, as needed. For more
reflection on 2006 and our thoughts on the year ahead, please ask your
financial professional for a copy of "What's Ahead in 2007: An Investment
Perspective," or view it online at www.blackrock.com/funds. We thank you for
trusting BlackRock with your investment assets, and we look forward to
continuing to serve you in the new year and beyond.


Sincerely,


(Robert C. Doll, Jr.)

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Managers


The Fund provided shareholders with an attractive level of income during the
fiscal year while continuing to protect investor principal.


How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year in light of the existing
market and economic conditions?

For the 12-month period ended December 31, 2006, the Common Stock of BlackRock
Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. (formerly Capital and Income
Strategies Fund, Inc.) had net annualized yields of 3.93% and 4.41%, based on
a year-end per share net asset value of $22.91 and a per share market price of
$20.41, respectively, and $0.900 per share income dividends. Over the same
period, the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +21.70%,
based on a change in per share net asset value from $20.31 to $22.91, and
assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

For the same 12-month period, the Fund's composite benchmark returned
+14.62%*, while its comparable Lipper category of Income and Preferred Stock
Funds had an average return of +13.90%. (Funds in this Lipper category
normally seek a high level of current income through investment in income-
producing stocks, bonds and money market instruments, or funds in the category
may invest primarily in preferred securities, often considering tax-code
implications.)

Consistent with its stated investment objective, the Fund was able to provide
investors with current income while also seeking capital appreciation. The
Fund's shareholders realized a level of cash flow during the period.

It was a volatile year for financial markets, although both equities and bonds
ultimately landed in positive territory. Fixed income markets struggled early
in the year amid solid economic growth and rising commodity prices, especially
oil and gasoline prices. Stocks, meanwhile, successfully weathered volatility
and posted their best first-quarter gains in several years. Momentum shifted
toward mid-year as a far-reaching market correction sent the average U.S.
stock 12% lower. Emerging markets were particularly hard hit. The pullback
could be attributed to several factors, but primarily, it appeared that the
lagged effects of higher interest rates and oil prices were finally taking
their toll on the economy and stock prices. In addition, a resurgence of
inflation fears had prompted the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) to continue
its interest rate tightening campaign through June.


 * The Fund's composite benchmark is a blend of the Merrill Lynch
   Preferred Stock DRD-Eligible Index; the JPMorgan Emerging
   Markets Bond Global Index; three-month LIBOR; and the
   S&P 500/Citigroup Value Index.


Conditions began to improve in the summer. Yields began to fall, and bond
prices increase, as economic growth softened and the Fed refrained from
raising its target interest rate at its August 8 meeting. Oil prices, after
reaching an all-time high near $78 per barrel in July, also began to recede
and ended the year where they started - at $61 per barrel. Stocks found favor
in these developments as well and generally climbed back above the levels they
reached prior to the market's retrenchment.

For the six-month period ended December 31, 2006, the total investment return
on the Fund's Common Stock was +17.01%, based on a change in per share net
asset value from $20.43 to $22.91, and assuming reinvestment of all
distributions.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in
the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the
trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and
assuming reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights
section of this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in
the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value.
As a result, total investment returns based on changes in the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns
based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.


What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

Within the equity portion of the portfolio, one of the most significant shifts
over the past year involved deemphasizing energy and turning some of that
focus toward health care. This reflects the changing leadership in the
marketplace and the specific values we have been able to find. Notably, as
indicated in our last report to shareholders, we have found attractive
valuations in several large, multinational companies and added these types of
investments to the equity portfolio. This contributed to performance during
the year.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



The preferred portfolio remained underweight in agency paper in favor of QDI
(qualified dividend income)-eligible securities, which offer more attractive
yields. Preferred securities underperformed corporate bonds in the first half
of 2006 due to the dramatic increase in interest rates, which negatively
impacted the asset class. This scenario improved as the market rallied in the
second half of the year, resulting in strong performance. At period-end, our
duration position closely matched that of our benchmark.

Within the emerging markets segment of the portfolio, we continued to evaluate
our country exposures and make adjustments based on our assessment of risk and
reward in individual markets. We focused on making relative value trades and
sought to take advantage of opportunities to enhance yield whenever possible.

Of final note, the Fund was approximately 28% leveraged at December 31, 2006.
For a complete discussion of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 2
of this report to shareholders.


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

The Fund's allocation at the end of the year comprised 62% U.S. large cap
value stocks, 19% preferred stocks, 12% short-term emerging markets debt
and 7% intermediate-/long-term emerging markets bonds. This compared to 58%
U.S. large cap value stocks, 22% preferred stocks, 14% short-term emerging
markets debt and 6% intermediate-/long-term emerging markets bonds on
December 31, 2005.

At year-end, the equity portfolio was overweight versus the S&P 500 Citigroup
Value Index in energy, consumer staples, information technology, health care
and consumer discretionary. It had underweights in financials, utilities,
industrials and telecommunication services. We continue to find that large-
capitalization companies offer a more compelling value proposition as we enter
a potentially slower phase of economic growth. We have been encouraged by the
economy, which has led to healthy corporate profits, strong corporate balance
sheets and an active merger-and-acquisition landscape. This has translated
into healthy equity markets. We believe a Goldilocks economy (not too hot, not
too cold) has begun to take hold. While we expect these factors should remain
in place, we are mindful that weakness in the housing market could lead to a
slower rate of growth for the economy in the future.

Within the preferred portfolio, we maintain a positive outlook based on
attractive valuations and abundant liquidity. In addition, we believe the
sector remains largely insulated from leveraged buyout risk. We continue to
emphasize QDI- and floating rate DRD (dividends received deduction)-eligible
securities for their attractive yields.

In emerging market bonds, the Fund ended the year overweight in Argentina, the
Dominican Republic, Peru and the Philippines, where we expect continued
improvement in credit fundamentals to lead to spread tightening. The portfolio
maintained exposure to local currency markets in Turkey, Brazil and Mexico,
where we are seeking to profit from the interest rate easing policies already
under way. The emerging markets portfolio is also positioned to benefit from
Asian currencies' appreciation trend against the U.S. dollar through exposure
to high-yielding currencies like the Indonesian Rupiah and Philippine Peso.
Finally, we are poised to take advantage of potential credit upgrades among
sovereign issues.

The Fund will continue to monitor market and economic conditions in an effort
to make the most effective use of its strategic allocations.

BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Notes to Financial Statements


1. Significant Accounting Policies:
On September 29, 2006, Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. was renamed
BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"). The Fund is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's financial
statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, which may require the use of management accruals and estimates.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Fund determines and makes
available for publication the net asset value of its Common Stock on a daily
basis. The Fund's Common Stock shares are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol CII. The following is a summary of
significant accounting policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments--Debt securities are traded primarily in the over-
the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price in
the OTC markets or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general
direction of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures will be
reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Financial futures
contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at
their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or
purchased are valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded
options. Options traded in the OTC market are valued at the last asked price
(options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap agreements
are valued based upon quoted fair valuations received daily by the Fund from a
pricing service or counterparty. Short-term investments with a remaining
maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates
market value, under which method the investment is valued at cost and any
premium or discount is amortized on a straight line basis to maturity.
Repurchase agreements are valued at cost plus accrued interest. The Fund
employs pricing services to provide certain securities prices for the Fund.
Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily available
are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction
of the Board of Directors of the Fund, including valuations furnished by the
pricing services retained by the Fund, which may utilize a matrix system for
valuations.

Equity securities held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the
NASDAQ Global Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price
on the exchange, as of the close of business on the day the securities are
being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last available bid price for long
positions, and at the last available asked price for short positions. In cases
where equity securities are traded on more than one exchange, the securities
are valued on the exchange designated as the primary market by or under the
authority of the Board of Directors of the Fund. Long positions traded in the
OTC markets, NASDAQ Capital Market or Bulletin Board are valued at the last
available bid price or yield equivalent obtained from one or more dealers or
pricing services approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Short
positions traded in the OTC markets are valued at the last available asked
price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in the OTC markets and on a
stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed income securities, is
substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of
business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the net
asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of such times. Foreign
currency exchange rates will generally be determined as of the close of
business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the values of such
securities and such exchange rates may occur between the times at which they
are determined and the close of business on the NYSE that may not be reflected
in the computation of the Fund's net asset value. If events (for example, a
company announcement, market volatility or a natural disaster) occur during
such periods that are expected to materially affect the value of such
securities, those securities will be valued at their fair value as determined
in good faith by the Fund's Board of Directors or by the Manager using a
pricing service and/or procedures approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the
securities markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the
contract resulting from an unfavorable price change in the underlying security
or index, or if the counterparty does not perform under the contract.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


* Options--The Fund may write and purchase call and put options. When the Fund
writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund is
reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability
is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the
option written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from)
the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a
closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the
extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the
cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

* Financial futures contracts--The Fund may purchase or sell financial futures
contracts and options on such financial futures contracts. Financial futures
contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific
future date and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract,
the Fund deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required
by the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of
cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or
payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as
unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

* Swaps--The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are OTC contracts in
which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments on a
specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set period of
time or may be triggered by a predetermined credit event. The net periodic
payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate; the change in
market value of a specified security, basket of securities, or index; or the
return generated by a security. These periodic payments received or made by
the Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of Operations as realized
gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are realized upon termination
of the swap agreements. Swaps are marked-to-market and changes in value are
recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in
the returns of the underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to
perform under the contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with
respect to the swap agreements.

(c) Income taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

(d) Security transactions and investment income--Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions--Dividends are declared and paid quarterly.
Distribution of capital gains are recorded on the ex-dividend dates.

(f) Securities lending--The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at
least 100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market
value of the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the
Fund and any additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the
next business day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the
loaned securities, it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically
receives the income on the loaned securities but does not receive the income
on the collateral. Where the Fund receives cash collateral it may invest such
collateral and retain the amount earned on such investment, net of any amount
rebated to the borrower. Loans of securities are terminable at any time and
the borrower, after notice, is required to return the borrowed securities
within five business days. The Fund may pay reasonable finder's, lending
agent, administrative and custodial fees in connection with its loans. In the
event that the borrower defaults on its obligation to return borrowed
securities because of insolvency or for any other reason, the Fund could
experience delays and costs in gaining access to the collateral. The Fund also
could suffer a loss where the value of the collateral falls below the market
value of the borrowed securities, in the event of borrower default or in the
event of losses on investments made with cash collateral.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


(g) Recent accounting pronouncements--In July 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109."
FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet
in connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken
or expected to be taken by an entity including mutual funds before being
measured and recognized in the financial statements. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for the last net asset value calculation in the first required
financial statement reporting period for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2006. The impact on the Fund's financial statements, if any, is currently
being assessed.

In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued and is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating
the implications of FAS 157. At this time, its impact on the Fund's financial
statements has not been determined.

(h) Reclassification--U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require
that certain components of net assets be adjusted to reflect permanent
differences between financial and tax reporting. Accordingly, during the
current year, $15,098 has been reclassified between undistributed net realized
capital gains and undistributed net investment income as a result of permanent
differences attributable to amortization methods on fixed income securities,
accounting for paydowns and swap agreements. This reclassification has no
effect on net assets or net asset values per share.


2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:
On September 29, 2006, BlackRock, Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill
Lynch") combined Merrill Lynch's investment management business, Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers, L.P. ("MLIM"), and its affiliates, including Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"), with BlackRock, Inc. to create a new independent
company. Merrill Lynch has a 49.8% economic interest and a 45% voting interest
in the combined company and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC"),
has approximately a 34% economic and voting interest. The new company operates
under the BlackRock name and is governed by a board of directors with a
majority of independent members.

On August 15, 2006, shareholders of the Fund approved a new Investment
Advisory Agreement with BlackRock Advisors, Inc. (the "Manager"), an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock Advisors, Inc. was
recently reorganized into a limited liability company and renamed BlackRock
Advisors, LLC. The new Investment Advisory Agreement between the Fund and the
Manager became effective on September 29, 2006. Prior to September 29, 2006,
FAM was the Fund's Manager. The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services,
Inc. ("PSI"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, which is
the limited partner.

The Manager is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund
pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of .85% of the Fund's average daily net
assets, including the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for
leverage. In addition, the Manager has entered into sub-advisory agreements
with BlackRock Investment Management, LLC ("BIM") and BlackRock Financial
Management, Inc., both affiliates of the Manager, under which the Manager pays
each Sub-Adviser for services it provides a fee that is a percentage of the
management fee paid by the Fund to the Manager.

The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S"), an affiliate of the Manager,
or its affiliates. Pursuant to that order, the Fund has retained BIM as the
securities lending agent for a fee based on a share of the returns on
investment of cash collateral. Prior to September 29, 2006, BIM was organized
as Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, LLC ("MLIM, LLC"), an affiliate of FAM,
and MLIM, LLC was the securities lending agent. BIM may, on behalf of the
Fund, invest cash, collateral received by the Fund for such loans, among other

4. Capital Share Transactions:
The Fund is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of capital stock, par value
$.10 per share, all of which were initially classified as Common Stock. The
Board of Directors is authorized, however, to reclassify any unissued shares
of stock without approval of holders of Common Stock.


Common Stock

Shares issued and outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2006
decreased by 641,500 as a result of a share repurchase program. Shares issued
and outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2005 remained constant.

The Fund will make offers to repurchase its shares at annual (approximately
12-month) intervals. The shares tendered in the share repurchase program will
be subject to a repurchase fee retained by the Fund to compensate the Fund for
expenses directly related to the repurchase offer.


5. Short-Term Borrowings:
On May 22, 2006, the Fund renewed its revolving credit and security agreement
funded by a commercial paper asset securitization program with Citicorp North
America, Inc. ("Citicorp") as Agent, certain secondary backstop lenders, and
certain asset securitization conduits as lenders (the "Lenders"). The
agreement was renewed for one year and has a maximum limit of $135,000,000.
Under the Citicorp program, the conduits will fund advances to the Fund
through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. As security for its
obligations to the Lenders under the revolving securitization facility, the
Fund has granted a security interest in substantially all of its assets to and
in favor of the Lenders. The interest rate on the Fund's borrowings is based
on the interest rate carried by the commercial paper plus a program fee. The
Fund pays additional borrowing costs including asset securitization fees and a
backstop commitment fee.

For the year ended December 31, 2006, the average amount borrowed was
approximately $107,504,000 and the daily weighted average interest rate was
5.32%.


6. Distributions to Shareholders:
The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended December
31, 2006 and December 31, 2005 was as follows:


                                          12/31/2006         12/31/2005

Distributions paid from:
   Ordinary income                    $   10,997,211    $    11,547,213
   Long-term capital gains                 7,264,347          3,849,071
                                      --------------    ---------------
Total taxable distributions           $   18,261,558    $    15,396,284
                                      ==============    ===============


As of December 31, 2006, the components of accumulated earnings on a
tax basis were as follows:


Undistributed ordinary income--net                      $       295,648
Undistributed long-term capital gains--net                    6,162,294
                                                        ---------------
Total undistributed earnings--net                             6,457,942
Capital loss carryforward                                            --
Unrealized gains--net                                       40,465,262*
                                                        ---------------
Total accumulated earnings--net                         $    46,923,204
                                                        ===============

 * The difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized
   gains is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of losses on wash
    sales, the tax deferral of losses on straddles, the difference between
   book and tax amortization methods for premiums and discounts on
   fixed income securities and other book/tax temporary differences.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
of BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and capital,
including the schedule of investments of BlackRock Capital and Income
Strategies Fund, Inc. (formerly Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc.) as
of December 31, 2006 and the related statements of operations and cash flows
for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for the
respective periods then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial
highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2006,
by correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not
received from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. as of December 31, 2006,
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,
and its financial highlights for the respective periods then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Fund Certification


In September 2006, the Fund filed its Chief Executive Officer Certification
for the prior year with the New York Stock Exchange pursuant to Section
303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Listing
Standards.

The Fund's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer Certifications
pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 were filed with the
Fund's Form N-CSR and are available on the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.



Managed Distribution Policy


The Fund has adopted a policy of paying regular distributions on its Common
Stock (the "Managed Distribution Policy"). The Fund's Board of Directors has
initially determined to pay quarterly distributions at an annualized rate of
6% of the initial public offering price per share ($.30 per share, per
quarter). The Fund's Board of Directors has determined to pay additional
distributions on an annual basis equal to any income earned by the Fund in
excess of the quarterly distributions as may be necessary to distribute
substantially all of the Fund's net investment company taxable income for that
year.

The Fund generally is not permitted to distribute net realized long-term
capital gains more than once per year without exemptive relief from the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, the Fund has applied for an
exemptive order that will permit the Fund to make periodic distributions of
realized long-term capital gains to its shareholders. Until such time, if any,
as the exemptive relief is granted, the Fund intends to make distributions
from its net investment income on a quarterly basis and from its net realized
long-term capital gains, if any, on an annual basis. If such exemptive relief
is granted, the Fund intends to make distributions from its net investment
income and its realized long-term capital gains, if any, on a quarterly basis.

If the total distributions paid by the Fund to its shareholders for any
calendar year exceed the Fund's net investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gain for that year, the excess will generally be treated as a
tax-free return of capital up to the amount of a shareholder's tax basis in
his or her stock. Any distributions that constitute tax-free return of capital
will reduce a shareholder's tax basis in his or her stock. In effect, a return
of capital is the return of a shareholder's investment in the Fund and will
result in a corresponding decline in the Fund's net asset value. Return of
capital distributions also may have the effect of increasing the Fund's
operating expense ratio. Any amounts distributed to a shareholder in excess of
such shareholder's tax basis in his or her stock will generally be taxable to
the shareholder as capital gain.

The Fund currently expects that the amount of distributions made under the
Managed Distribution Policy generally will be independent of, and not
contingent upon, the Fund's performance in any of the first three quarters of
the Fund's fiscal year. Distribution rates under the Managed Distribution
Policy may be increased in the Fund's fourth fiscal quarter in light of the
Fund's performance for the fiscal year and to enable the Fund to comply with
the distribution requirements applicable to regulated investment companies. It
also is currently expected that the Fund's investment portfolio initially will
not produce sufficient dividend and interest income to fully fund
distributions under the Managed Distribution Policy. Consequently, if the Fund
does not realize sufficient short-term capital gains and long-term capital
gains to make up any shortfall, distributions to the Fund's Common Stock
shareholders will include returns of capital. Prior to receipt of the above-
referenced exemptive order, long-term capital gains will be available to make
up any shortfall in funding distributions only on an annual basis, thereby
increasing the likelihood that distributions will include returns of capital
to shareholders. The Fund is not required to maintain the Managed Distribution
Policy and such policy (including the amount of the quarterly distribution)
may be modified or terminated at any time without notice. Any such
modification or termination of the Managed Distribution Policy may have an
adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's Common Stock.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan


How the Plan Works--The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which income and capital gains dividends paid by the Fund are
automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock of the Fund. The
Plan is administered on behalf of the shareholders by The Bank of New York
(the "Plan Agent"). Under the Plan, whenever the Fund declares a dividend,
participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of Common Stock
of the Fund. The Plan Agent will acquire the shares for the participant's
account either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized
shares of the Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding
shares of Common Stock on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or
elsewhere. If, on the dividend payment date, the Fund's net asset value per
share is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated
brokerage commissions (a condition often referred to as a "market premium"),
the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued shares. If the
Fund's net asset value per share is greater than the market price per share (a
condition often referred to as a "market discount"), the Plan Agent will
invest the dividend amount by purchasing on the open market additional shares.
If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend amount in open market
purchases, or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the
purchase period, the Plan Agent will invest any uninvested portion in newly
issued shares. The shares acquired are credited to each shareholder's account.
The amount credited is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
dividend by either (i) when the shares are newly issued, the net asset value
per share on the date the shares are issued or (ii) when shares are purchased
in the open market, the average purchase price per share.

Participation in the Plan--Participation in the Plan is automatic, that is, a
shareholder is automatically enrolled in the Plan when he or she purchases
shares of Common Stock of the Fund unless the shareholder specifically elects
not to participate in the Plan. Shareholders who elect not to participate will
receive all dividend distributions in cash. Shareholders who do not wish to
participate in the Plan, must advise the Plan Agent in writing (at the address
set forth below) that they elect not to participate in the Plan. Participation
in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any
time without penalty by writing to the Plan Agent.

Benefits of the Plan--The Plan provides an easy, convenient way for
shareholders to make additional, regular investments in the Fund. The Plan
promotes a long-term strategy of investing at a lower cost. All shares
acquired pursuant to the Plan receive voting rights. In addition, if the
market price plus commissions of the Fund's shares is above the net asset
value, participants in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund for less than
they could otherwise purchase them and with a cash value greater than the
value of any cash distribution they would have received. However, there may
not be enough shares available in the market to make distributions in shares
at prices below the net asset value. Also, since the Fund does not redeem
shares, the price on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

Plan Fees--There are no enrollment fees or brokerage fees for participating in
the Plan. The Plan Agent's service fees for handling the reinvestment of
distributions are paid for by the Fund. However, brokerage commissions may be
incurred when the Fund purchases shares on the open market and shareholders
will pay a pro rata share of any such commissions.

Tax Implications--The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that
may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends. Therefore,
income and capital gains may still be realized even though shareholders do not
receive cash. Participation in the Plan generally will not affect the tax-
exempt status of exempt interest dividends paid by the Fund. If, when the
Fund's shares are trading at a market premium, the Fund issues shares pursuant
to the Plan that have a greater fair market value than the amount of cash
reinvested, it is possible that all or a portion of the discount from the
market value (which may not exceed 5% of the fair market value of the Fund's
shares) could be viewed as a taxable distribution. If the discount is viewed
as a taxable distribution, it is also possible that the taxable character of
this discount would be allocable to all the shareholders, including
shareholders who do not participate in the Plan. Thus, shareholders who do not
participate in the Plan might be required to report as ordinary income a
portion of their distributions equal to their allocable share of the discount.

Contact Information--All correspondence concerning the Plan, including any
questions about the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Agent at The Bank of
New York, Church Street Station, P.O. Box 11258, New York, NY 10286-1258,
Telephone: 800-432-8224.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement


BlackRock Investment Advisory Agreement--Matters Considered by the Board

The following disclosure appeared in the June 30, 2006 Semi-Annual Report of
the Fund and is the discussion referred to in "New BlackRock Sub-Advisory
Agreements - Matters Considered by the Board" below. The term "Investment
Adviser" as used herein refers to Fund Asset Management, L.P.

In connection with the Transaction between Merrill Lynch and BlackRock, the
Fund's Board of Directors considered a new investment advisory agreement (the
"New Investment Advisory Agreement") between the Fund and BlackRock Advisors,
Inc. or its successor ("BlackRock Advisors"). If the New Investment Advisory
Agreement is approved by the Fund's shareholders, it will become effective
upon the expected closing of the Transaction, which is expected in the third
quarter of 2006.

The Board discussed the New Investment Advisory Agreement at telephonic and
in-person meetings held during April and May 2006. The Board, including the
independent directors, approved the New Investment Advisory Agreement at a
meeting held on May 10, 2006.

To assist the Board in its consideration of the New Investment Advisory
Agreement, BlackRock provided materials and information about BlackRock,
including its financial condition and asset management capabilities and
organization, and Merrill Lynch provided materials and information about the
Transaction. The independent directors, through their independent legal
counsel, also requested and received additional information from Merrill Lynch
and BlackRock in connection with their consideration of the New Investment
Advisory Agreement. The additional information was provided in advance of the
May 10, 2006 meeting. In addition, the independent directors consulted with
their counsel and Fund counsel on numerous occasions, discussing, among other
things, the legal standards and certain other considerations relevant to the
directors' deliberations.

At the Board meetings, the directors discussed with Merrill Lynch management
and certain BlackRock representatives the Transaction, its strategic rationale
and BlackRock's general plans and intentions regarding the Fund. At these
Board meetings, representatives of Merrill Lynch and BlackRock made
presentations to and responded to questions from the Board. The directors also
inquired about the plans for and anticipated roles and responsibilities of
certain employees and officers of the Investment Adviser and certain
affiliates being transferred to BlackRock in connection with the Transaction.
The independent directors also conferred separately and with their counsel
about the Transaction and other matters related to the Transaction on a number
of occasions, including in connection with the April and May 2006 meetings.
After the presentations and after reviewing the written materials provided,
the independent directors met in executive sessions with their counsel to
consider the New Investment Advisory Agreement.

In connection with the Board's review of the New Investment Advisory
Agreement, Merrill Lynch and/or BlackRock advised the directors about a
variety of matters. The advice included the following, among other matters:

* that there is not expected to be any diminution in the nature, quality and
  extent of services provided to the Fund and its shareholders by BlackRock
  Advisors, including compliance services;

* that operation of New BlackRock as an independent investment management
  firm will enhance its ability to attract and retain talented professionals;

* that the Fund should benefit from having access to BlackRock's state of the
  art technology and risk management analytic tools, including investment
  tools, provided under the BlackRock Solutions (R) brand name;

* that BlackRock has no present intention to alter any applicable expense
  waivers or reimbursements currently in effect and, while it reserves the
  right to do so in the future, it would seek the approval of the Board
  before making any changes;

* that in connection with the Transaction, Merrill Lynch and BlackRock have
  agreed to conduct, and use reasonable best efforts to cause their
  respective affiliates to conduct, their respective businesses in compliance
  with the conditions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
  (the "1940 Act") in relation to any public funds advised by BlackRock or
  the Investment Adviser (or its affiliates), respectively; and

* that Merrill Lynch and BlackRock would derive benefits from the Transaction
  and that, as a result, they have a different financial interest in the
  matters that were being considered than do Fund shareholders.

The directors considered the information provided by Merrill Lynch and
BlackRock above, and, among other factors, the following:



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement (continued)


* the potential benefits to Fund shareholders from being part of a combined
  fund family with BlackRock-sponsored funds, including possible economies of
  scale and access to investment opportunities;

* the reputation, financial strength and resources of BlackRock and its
  investment advisory subsidiaries and the anticipated financial strength and
  resources of New BlackRock;

* the compliance policies and procedures of BlackRock Advisors;

* the terms and conditions of the New Investment Advisory Agreement,
  including the fact that the schedule of the Fund's total advisory fees will
  not increase by virtue of the New Investment Advisory Agreement, but will
  remain the same;

* that in May 2005, the Board had performed a full annual review of the
  investment advisory agreement currently in effect for the Fund (the
  "Current Investment Advisory Agreement") as required by the 1940 Act and
  has determined that the Investment Adviser has the capabilities, resources
  and personnel necessary to provide the advisory and administrative services
  currently provided to the Fund; and that the advisory and/or management
  fees paid by the Fund, taking into account any applicable agreed-upon fee
  waivers and breakpoints, represent reasonable compensation to the
  Investment Adviser in light of the services provided, the costs to the
  Investment Adviser of providing those services, economies of scale, the
  fees and other expenses paid by similar funds (including information
  provided by Lipper Inc. ["Lipper"]), and such other matters as the
  directors have considered relevant in the exercise of their reasonable
  judgment; and

* that Merrill Lynch agreed to pay all expenses of the Fund in connection
  with the Board's consideration of the New Investment Advisory Agreement and
  related agreements and all costs of shareholder approval of the New
  Investment Advisory Agreement and as a result the Fund would bear no costs
  in obtaining shareholder approval of the New Investment Advisory Agreement.

Certain of these considerations are discussed in more detail below.

In its review of the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board assessed the
nature, scope and quality of the services to be provided to the Fund by the
personnel of BlackRock Advisors and its affiliates, including administrative
services, shareholder services, oversight of fund accounting and assistance in
meeting legal and regulatory requirements. In its review of the New Investment
Advisory Agreement, the Board also considered a range of information in
connection with its oversight of the services to be provided by BlackRock
Advisors and its affiliates. Among the matters considered were: (a) fees (in
addition to management fees) to be paid to BlackRock Advisors and its
affiliates by the Fund; (b) Fund operating expenses paid to third parties; (c)
the resources devoted to and compliance reports relating to the Fund's
investment objective, policies and restrictions, and its compliance with its
Code of Ethics and BlackRock Advisors' compliance policies and procedures; and
(d) the nature, cost and character of non-investment management services to be
provided by BlackRock Advisors and its affiliates.

In the period prior to the Board meeting to consider renewal of the Current
Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board had requested and received materials
specifically relating to the Current Investment Advisory Agreement. These
materials included (a) information compiled by Lipper on the fees and expenses
and the investment performance of the Fund as compared to a comparable group
of funds as classified by Lipper; (b) information comparing the Fund's market
price with its net asset value per share; (c) a discussion by the Fund's
portfolio management team on investment strategies used by the Fund during its
most recent fiscal year; (d) information on the profitability to the
Investment Adviser of the Current Investment Advisory Agreement and other
payments received by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates from the Fund;
and (e) information provided by the Investment Adviser concerning services
related to the valuation and pricing of Fund portfolio holdings, allocation of
Fund brokerage fees, the Fund's portfolio turnover statistics, and direct and
indirect benefits to the Investment Adviser and its affiliates from their
relationship with the Fund.

In their deliberations, the directors considered information received in
connection with the most recent continuation of the Current Investment
Advisory Agreement, in addition to information provided by BlackRock and
BlackRock Advisors in connection with their evaluation of the terms and
conditions of the New Investment Advisory Agreement. The directors did not
identify any particular information that was all-important or controlling, and
each director attributed different weights to the various factors. The
directors, including a majority of the independent directors, concluded that
the terms of the New Investment Advisory Agreement are appropriate, that the
fees to be paid are reasonable in light of the services to be provided to the
Fund, and that the New Investment Advisory Agreement should be approved and
recommended to Fund shareholders.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Nature, Quality and Extent of Services Provided--The Board reviewed the
nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Investment Adviser,
including the investment advisory services and the resulting performance of
the Fund, as well as the nature, quality and extent of services expected to be
provided by BlackRock Advisors. The Board focused primarily on the Investment
Adviser's advisory services and the Fund's investment performance, but also
considered certain areas in which both the Investment Adviser and the Fund
receive services as part of the Merrill Lynch complex. The Board compared the
Fund's performance - both including and excluding the effects of the Fund's
fees and expenses - to the performance of a comparable group of funds, and the
performance of a relevant index or combination of indexes. While the Board
reviews performance data at least quarterly, consistent with the Investment
Adviser's investment goals, the Board attaches more importance to performance
over relatively long periods of time, typically three to five years.

In evaluating the nature, quality and extent of the services to be provided by
BlackRock Advisors under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the directors
considered, among other things, the expected impact of the Transaction on the
operations, facilities, organization and personnel of BlackRock Advisors and
how it would affect the Fund; the ability of BlackRock Advisors to perform its
duties after the Transaction; and any anticipated changes to the current
investment and other practices of the Fund. The directors considered
BlackRock's advice as to proposed changes in portfolio management personnel of
the Fund after the closing of the Transaction.

The directors were given information with respect to the potential benefits to
the Fund and its shareholders from having access to BlackRock's state of the
art technology and risk management analytic tools, including the investment
tools provided under the BlackRock Solutions brand name.

The directors were advised that, as a result of Merrill Lynch's equity
interest in BlackRock after the Transaction, the Fund will continue to be
subject to restrictions concerning certain transactions involving Merrill
Lynch affiliates (for example, transactions with a Merrill Lynch broker-dealer
acting as principal) absent revised or new regulatory relief. The directors
were advised that a revision of existing regulatory relief with respect to
these restrictions was being sought from the Securities and Exchange
Commission and were advised of the possibility of receipt of such revised
regulatory relief. There can be no assurance that such relief will be
obtained.

Based on their review of the materials provided and the assurances they had
received from the management of Merrill Lynch and of BlackRock, the directors
determined that the nature and quality of services to be provided to the Fund
under the New Investment Advisory Agreement were expected to be as good as or
better than that provided under the Current Investment Advisory Agreement. It
was noted, however, that it is expected that there will be changes in
personnel following the Transaction and the combination of the operations of
the Investment Adviser and its affiliates with those of BlackRock. The
directors noted that if current portfolio managers or other personnel cease to
be available, the Board would consider all available options, which could
include seeking the investment advisory or other services of BlackRock
affiliates. Accordingly, the directors concluded that, overall, they were
satisfied at the present time with assurances from BlackRock and BlackRock
Advisors as to the expected nature, extent and quality of the services to be
provided to the Fund under the New Investment Advisory Agreement.

Costs of Services Provided and Profitability--It was noted that, in
conjunction with the recent review of the Current Investment Advisory
Agreement, the directors had received, among other things, a report from
Lipper comparing the Fund's fees, expenses and performance to those of a peer
group selected by Lipper, and information as to the fees charged by the
Investment Adviser or its affiliates to other registered investment company
clients for investment management services. The Board reviewed the Fund's
contractual management fee rate and actual management fee rate as a percentage
of total assets at common asset levels - the actual rate includes advisory
fees and the effects of any fee waivers - compared to the other funds in its
Lipper category. They also compared the Fund's total expenses to those of
other comparable funds. The information showed that the Fund had fees and
expenses within the range of fees and expenses of comparable funds. The Board
considered the services to be provided by and the fees to be charged by
BlackRock Advisors to other funds with similar investment mandates and noted
that the fees charged by BlackRock Advisors in those cases, including fee
waivers and expense reimbursements, were generally comparable to those being
charged to the Fund. The Board also noted that, as a general matter, according
to the information provided by BlackRock, fees charged to institutional
clients were lower than the fees charged to the Fund, but BlackRock Advisors
provided less extensive services to such clients. The Board concluded that the
Fund's management fee and fee rate and overall expense ratio are reasonable
compared to those of other comparable funds.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement (concluded)


In evaluating the costs of the services to be provided by BlackRock Advisors
under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the directors considered, among
other things, whether advisory fees or other expenses would change as a result
of the Transaction. Based on their review of the materials provided and the
fact that the New Investment Advisory Agreement is substantially similar to
the Current Investment Advisory Agreement in all material respects, including
the rate of compensation, the directors determined that the Transaction should
not increase the total fees payable, including any fee waivers and expense
reimbursements, for advisory and administrative services. The directors noted
that it was not possible to predict with certainty New BlackRock's future
profitability from its relationship with the Fund.

The directors discussed with BlackRock Advisors its general methodology to be
used in determining New BlackRock's profitability with respect to its
relationship with the Fund. The directors noted that they expect to receive
profitability information from New BlackRock on at least an annual basis and
thus be in a position to evaluate whether any adjustments in Fund fees and/or
fee breakpoints would be appropriate.

Fees and Economies of Scale--The Board considered the extent to which
economies of scale might be realized as the assets of the Fund increase and
whether there should be changes in the management fee rate or structure in
order to enable the Fund to participate in these economies of scale. The Board
determined that changes were not currently necessary and that the Fund
appropriately participated in these economies of scale.

In reviewing the Transaction, the directors considered, among other things,
whether advisory fees or other expenses would change as a result of the
Transaction. Based on the fact that the New Investment Advisory Agreement is
substantially similar to the Current Investment Advisory Agreement in all
material respects, including the rate of compensation, the directors
determined that as a result of the Transaction, the Fund's total advisory fees
would be no higher than the fees under its Current Investment Advisory
Agreement. The directors noted that in conjunction with their most recent
deliberations concerning the Current Investment Advisory Agreement, they had
determined that the total fees for advisory and administrative services for
the Fund were reasonable in light of the services provided. It was noted that
in conjunction with the recent review of the Current Investment Advisory
Agreement, the directors had received, among other things, a report from
Lipper comparing the Fund's fees, expenses and performance to those of a peer
group selected by Lipper, and information as to the fees charged by the
Investment Adviser or its affiliates to other registered investment company
clients for investment management services. The directors concluded that,
because the rates for advisory fees for the Fund would be no higher than its
current fee rates, the proposed management fee structure, including any fee
waivers, was reasonable and that no additional changes were currently
necessary.

Fall-Out Benefits--In evaluating the fall-out benefits to be received by
BlackRock Advisors under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the directors
considered whether the Transaction would have an impact on the fall-out
benefits received by the Investment Adviser by virtue of the Current
Investment Advisory Agreement. Based on their review of the materials
provided, including materials received in connection with their most recent
continuance of the Current Investment Advisory Agreement, and their
discussions with management of the Investment Adviser and BlackRock, the
directors determined that those benefits could include increased ability for
BlackRock to distribute shares of its funds and other investment products and
to obtain research services using the Fund's portfolio transaction brokerage
commissions. The directors noted that any fall-out benefits were difficult to
quantify with certainty at this time, and indicated that they would continue
to evaluate them going forward.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Investment Performance--The directors considered investment performance for
the Fund. The directors compared the Fund's performance - both including and
excluding the effects of the Fund's fees and expenses - to the performance of
a comparable group of funds, and the performance of a relevant index or
combination of indexes. The comparative information received from Lipper
showed Fund performance at various levels within the range of performance of
comparable funds over different time periods. While the Board reviews
performance data at least quarterly, consistent with the Investment Adviser's
investment goals, the Board attaches more importance over relatively long
periods of time, typically three to five years. The directors believed the
Fund's performance was satisfactory. Also, the directors took into account the
investment performance of funds currently advised by BlackRock Advisors. The
Board considered comparative information from Lipper which showed that the
performance of the funds advised by BlackRock Advisors was within the range of
performance of comparable funds over different time periods. The Board noted
BlackRock's considerable investment management experience and capabilities,
but was unable to predict what effect, if any, consummation of the Transaction
would have on the future performance of the Fund.

Conclusion--After the independent directors of the Fund deliberated in
executive session, the entire Board, including the independent directors,
approved the New Investment Advisory Agreement, concluding that the advisory
fee rate was reasonable in relation to the services provided and that the New
Investment Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of the shareholders.
In approving the New Investment Advisory Agreement, the Board noted that it
anticipated reviewing the continuance of the agreement in advance of the
expiration of the initial two-year period.


Contingent BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement--Matters Considered by the Board

At the telephonic and in-person meetings held during April and May 2006 at
which the Board of Directors discussed and approved the New Investment
Advisory Agreement, the Board, including the independent directors, also
considered and approved a contingent sub-advisory agreement (the "Contingent
Sub-Advisory Agreement") between the Investment Adviser and BlackRock Advisors
(the "BlackRock Sub-Adviser"). The Contingent Sub-Advisory Agreement is
intended to ensure that the Fund operate with efficient portfolio management
services until the closing of the Transaction, in the event that the Board
deems it necessary and in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders
that the BlackRock Sub-Adviser assist in managing the operations of the Fund
during the interim period until the closing of the Transaction. If
shareholders approve the Contingent Sub-Advisory Agreement, it will take
effect only upon recommendation from the Investment Adviser and upon
subsequent approval of the Board in the period up to the closing of the
Transaction. The effectiveness of the Contingent Sub-Advisory Agreement,
therefore, would be contingent on further Board approval after shareholders
approve it. Pursuant to the Contingent Sub-Advisory Agreement, the BlackRock
Sub-Adviser would receive a monthly fee from the Investment Adviser equal to
50% of the advisory fee received by the Investment Adviser. The Investment
Adviser would pay the BlackRock Sub-Adviser out of its own resources. There
would be no increase in Fund expenses as a result of the Contingent Sub-
Advisory Agreement.

In making its approval at the May in-person meeting, the Board considered the
Contingent Sub-Advisory Agreement in conjunction with the New Investment
Advisory Agreement and reviewed the same information and factors discussed
above. The Board also considered in conjunction with the Contingent Sub-
Advisory Agreement the necessity of ensuring that the Fund operates with
effective management services until the closing of the Transaction. In
reviewing the sub-advisory fee rate provided in the Contingent Sub-Advisory
Agreement, the Board took note of the fact that both the Investment Adviser
and the BlackRock Sub-Adviser would have significant responsibilities under
their respective advisory agreements. The Investment Adviser would remain
responsible for oversight of the Fund's operations and administration and the
BlackRock Sub-Adviser would provide advisory services to the Fund under the
Contingent Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Board also took into account the
expected short duration of the term of any Contingent Sub-Advisory Agreement
and the fact that total advisory fees paid by the Fund would not increase as a
result of the Contingent Sub-Advisory Agreement. Under all of the
circumstances, the Board concluded that it was a reasonable allocation of fees
for the BlackRock Sub-Adviser to receive 50% of the advisory fee paid by the
Fund to the Investment Adviser.

After the independent directors deliberated in executive session, the entire
Board, including the independent directors, approved the Contingent Sub-
Advisory Agreement, concluding that the advisory fee was reasonable in
relation to the services provided and that the Contingent Sub-Advisory
Agreement was in the best interests of shareholders.



BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006



Disclosure of Sub-Advisory Agreement


New BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreements--Matters Considered by the Board

At an in-person meeting held on August 24 - 25, 2006, the Board of Directors,
including the independent directors, discussed and approved the sub-advisory
agreements with respect to the Fund between BlackRock Advisors, LLC
(previously organized as BlackRock Advisors, Inc.) ("BlackRock Advisors") and
each of BlackRock Financial Management, Inc. and BlackRock Investment
Management, LLC, each an affiliate (the "Sub-Advisers") (the "BlackRock Sub-
Advisory Agreements"). The BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreements became effective
on September 29, 2006, at the same time the New Investment Advisory Agreement
with BlackRock Advisors (which had been approved by the Fund's shareholders)
became effective.

Pursuant to the pertinent BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreement, each Sub-Adviser
receives a monthly fee from BlackRock Advisors at an annual rate equal to 37%
of the advisory fee received by BlackRock Advisors from the Fund. BlackRock
Advisors pays the Sub-Adviser out of its own resources, and there is no
increase in Fund expenses as a result of the BlackRock Sub-Advisory
Agreements.

In approving the BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreements at the August in-person
meeting, the Board reviewed its considerations in connection with its approval
of the New Investment Advisory Agreement in May 2006. The Board relied on the
same information and considered the same factors as those discussed above in
connection with the approval of the New Investment Advisory Agreement. In
reviewing the sub-advisory fee rate provided for in the BlackRock Sub-Advisory
Agreements, the Board noted the fact that both BlackRock Advisors and each Sub-
Adviser have significant responsibilities under their respective advisory
agreements. Under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, BlackRock Advisors
remains responsible for the overall management of the Fund and for oversight
of the Fund's operations and administration. Under the BlackRock Sub-Advisory
Agreements, each Sub-Adviser provides advisory services to the Fund and is
responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio. The Board
also took into account the fact that there is no increase in total advisory
fees paid by the Fund as a result of the BlackRock Sub-Advisory Agreements.
Based on its considerations, the Board concluded that it was a reasonable
allocation of fees for each Sub-Adviser to receive a fee at an annual rate
equal to 37% of the advisory fee paid by the Fund to BlackRock Advisors

After the independent directors deliberated in executive session, the entire
Board, including the independent directors, approved each BlackRock Sub-
Advisory Agreement, concluding that the sub-advisory fee was reasonable in
relation to the services provided and that each BlackRock Sub-Advisory
Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund's shareholders.

BLACKROCK CAPITAL AND INCOME STRATEGIES FUND, INC.            DECEMBER 31, 2006


Item 2 -   Code of Ethics - The registrant has adopted a code of ethics, as of
           the end of the period covered by this report, that applies to the
           registrant's principal executive officer, principal financial
           officer and principal accounting officer, or persons performing
           similar functions.  A copy of the code of ethics is available
           without charge at www.blackrock.com.

Item 3 -   Audit Committee Financial Expert - The registrant's board of
           directors has determined that (i) the registrant has the following
           audit committee financial experts serving on its audit committee and
           (ii) each audit committee financial expert is independent: (1) David
           O. Beim, (2) W. Carl Kester, (3) James T. Flynn and (4) Karen P.
           Robards.

           The registrant's board of directors has determined that David O.
           Beim, W. Carl Kester and Karen P. Robards qualify as financial
           experts pursuant to Item 3(c)(4) of Form N-CSR.

           Mr. Beim has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
           accounting principles, financial statements and internal control
           over financial reporting as well as audit committee functions.  For
           25 years, Mr. Beim was an investment banker actively engaged in
           financial analysis for securities transactions and mergers.  These
           transactions presented a breadth and level of complexity of
           accounting issues that are generally comparable to the breadth and
           complexity of issues that can reasonably be expected to be raised by
           the Registrant's financial statements.  Mr. Beim has also been a
           professor of finance and economics at the Columbia University
           Graduate School of Business for the past 13 years.

           Prof. Kester has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
           accounting principles, financial statements and internal control
           over financial reporting as well as audit committee functions.
           Prof. Kester has been involved in providing valuation and other
           financial consulting services to corporate clients since 1978.
           Prof. Kester's financial consulting services present a breadth and
           level of complexity of accounting issues that are generally
           comparable to the breadth and complexity of issues that can
           reasonably be expected to be raised by the Registrant's financial
           statements.

           Ms. Robards has a thorough understanding of generally accepted
           accounting principles, financial statements and internal control
           over financial reporting as well as audit committee functions.
           Ms. Robards has been President of Robards & Company, a financial
           advisory firm, since 1987.  Ms. Robards was formerly an investment
           banker for more than 10 years where she was responsible for
           evaluating and assessing the performance of companies based on their
           financial results.  Ms. Robards has over 30 years of experience
           analyzing financial statements.  She also is the member of the Audit
           Committees of two privately held companies and a non-profit
           organization.

           (a) Audit Fees -      Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2006 - $37,000

           (b) Audit-Related Fees -

           The nature of the services include agreed upon procedures related to
           credit facility.

           (c) Tax Fees -        Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2006 - $6,000
                                 Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2005 - $5,700

           The nature of the services include tax compliance, tax advice and

           (d) All Other Fees -  Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2006 - $0
                                 Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2005 - $0

           (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has
           adopted policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of
           services.  Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided
           to the registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval
           by the Committee.  The Committee also must approve other non-audit
           services provided to the registrant and those non-audit services
           provided to the registrant's affiliated service providers that
           relate directly to the operations and the financial reporting of the
           registrant.  Certain of these non-audit services that the Committee
           believes are a) consistent with the SEC's auditor independence rules
           and b) routine and recurring services that will not impair the
           independence of the independent accountants may be approved by the
           Committee without consideration on a specific case-by-case basis
           ("general pre-approval").  However, such services will only be
           deemed pre-approved provided that any individual project does not
           exceed $5,000 attributable to the registrant or $50,000 for all of
           the registrants the Committee oversees.  Any proposed services
           exceeding the pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-
           approval by the Committee, as will any other services not subject to
           general pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services).
           The Committee is informed of each service approved subject to
           general pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board
           meeting.

                Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2005 - $5,577,771

           (h) The registrant's audit committee has considered and determined
           that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
           registrant's investment adviser and any entity controlling,
           controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
           that provides ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-
           approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation
           S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
           independence.

Item 6 -   Schedule of Investments - Not Applicable

Item 7 -   Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
           Management Investment Companies -
           Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures

           Each Fund's Board of Directors has delegated to the Manager
           authority to vote all proxies relating to the Fund's portfolio
           securities. The Manager has adopted policies and procedures (the
           "Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the voting of proxies
           related to the portfolio securities held in the account of one or
           more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to these Proxy
           Voting Procedures, the Manager's primary objective when voting
           proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely in the best
           interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in a manner
           that the Manager believes is most likely to enhance the economic
           value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
           Procedures are designed to ensure that the Manager considers the
           interests of its clients, including each Fund, and not the interests
           of the Manager, when voting proxies and that real (or perceived)
           material conflicts that may arise between the Manager's interest and
           those of the Manager's clients are properly addressed and resolved.

           In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Manager has
           formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The Committee,
           which is a subcommittee of the Manager's Equity Investment Policy
           Oversight Committee ("EIPOC"), is comprised of a senior member of
           the Manager's equity management group who is also a member of EIPOC,
           one or more other senior investment professionals appointed by
           EIPOC, portfolio managers and investment analysts appointed by EIPOC
           and any other personnel EIPOC deems appropriate. The Committee will
           also include two non-voting representatives from the Manager's Legal
           Department appointed by the Manager's General Counsel. The
           Committee's membership shall be limited to full-time employees of
           the Manager. No person with any investment banking, trading, retail
           brokerage or research responsibilities for the Manager's affiliates
           may serve as a member of the Committee or participate in its
           decision making (except to the extent such person is asked by the
           Committee to present information to the Committee on the same basis
           as other interested knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the
           Manager might be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to
           vote the proxies of all clients, including a Fund, that have
           delegated proxy voting authority to the Manager and seeks to ensure
           that all votes are consistent with the best interests of those
           clients and are free from unwarranted and inappropriate influences.
           The Committee establishes general proxy voting policies for the
           Manager and is responsible for determining how those policies are
           applied to specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique
           structure, management, strategic options and, in certain
           circumstances, probable economic and other anticipated consequences
           of alternate actions. In so doing, the Committee may determine to
           vote a particular proxy in a manner contrary to its generally stated
           policies. In addition, the Committee will be responsible for
           ensuring that all reporting and recordkeeping requirements related
           to proxy voting are fulfilled.

           The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
           proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires
           a case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect
           not to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
           Manager believes that certain proxy voting issues require investment
           analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
           corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
           therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may
           elect to adopt a common position for the Manager on certain proxy
           votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit
           the portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to
           maximize economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell
           investment decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is
           expected that the Manager will generally seek to vote proxies over
           which the Manager exercises voting authority in a uniform manner for
           all the Manager's clients, the Committee, in conjunction with a
           Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
           circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

           To assist the Manager in voting proxies, the Committee has retained
           Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an independent
           adviser that specializes in providing a variety of fiduciary-level
           proxy-related services to institutional investment managers, plan
           sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other institutional
           investors. The services provided to the Manager by ISS include in-
           depth research, voting recommendations (although the Manager is not
           obligated to follow such recommendations), vote execution, and
           recordkeeping. ISS will also assist the Fund in fulfilling its
           reporting and recordkeeping obligations under the Investment Company
           Act.

           The Manager's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
           circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
           instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Manager generally
           will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities that
           are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
           addition, the Manager will vote proxies related to securities of
           foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may elect not to
           vote at all in certain countries where the Committee determines that
           the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the benefits.
           The Committee may at any time override these general policies if it
           determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

           From time to time, the Manager may be required to vote proxies in
           respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Manager (each, an
           "Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Manager,
           including investment companies for which the Manager provides
           investment advisory, administrative and/or other services (each, a
           "Client"), is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the
           Manager's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such
           conflicts of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to
           the Proxy Voting Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters
           involving Affiliates and Clients. If, however, an issue representing
           a non-routine matter that is material to an Affiliate or a widely
           known Client is involved such that the Committee does not reasonably
           believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if the particular
           proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
           impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes
           of ensuring that an independent determination is reached, retain an
           independent fiduciary to advise the Committee on how to vote or to
           cast votes on behalf of the Manager's clients.

           In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an
           independent fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an
           independent fiduciary, the Committee may pass the voting power to a
           subcommittee, appointed by EIPOC (with advice from the Secretary of
           the Committee), consisting solely of Committee members selected by
           EIPOC. EIPOC shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate,
           only persons whose job responsibilities do not include contact with
           the Client and whose job evaluations would not be affected by the
           Manager's relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such
           relationship). The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to
           vote all proxies on behalf of the Manager's clients or, if the proxy
           matter is, in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to
           defer to the applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the
           subcommittee determines to alter the Manager's normal voting
           guidelines or, on matters where the Manager's policy is case-by-
           case, does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting
           service or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to
           provide research or advice to the Manager on that matter, no proxies
           relating to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the
           Secretary's absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee
           concurs that the subcommittee's determination is consistent with the
           Manager's fiduciary duties.

           In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Manager
           has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
           proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
           These policies are guidelines only, and the Manager may elect to
           vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
           guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
           interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at
           any time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended
           or deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present
           at a Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

           The Manager has adopted specific voting guidelines with respect to
           the following proxy issues:

           * Proposals related to the composition of the board of directors of
             issuers other than investment companies. As a general matter, the
             Committee believes that a company's board of directors (rather
             than shareholders) is most likely to have access to important,
             nonpublic information regarding a company's business and
             prospects, and is, therefore, best-positioned to set corporate
             policy and oversee management. The Committee, therefore, believes
             that the foundation of good corporate governance is the election
             of qualified, independent corporate directors who are likely to
             diligently represent the interests of shareholders and oversee
             management of the corporation in a manner that will seek to
             maximize shareholder value over time. In individual cases, the
             Committee may look at a nominee's number of other directorships,
             history of representing shareholder interests as a director of
             other companies or other factors, to the extent the Committee
             deems relevant.

           * Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent
             auditors. As a general matter, the Committee believes that
             corporate auditors have a responsibility to represent the
             interests of shareholders and provide an independent view on the
             propriety of financial reporting decisions of corporate
             management. While the Committee will generally defer to a
             corporation's choice of auditor, in individual cases, the
             Committee may look at an auditors' history of representing
             shareholder interests as auditor of other companies, to the extent
             the Committee deems relevant.

           * Proposals related to management compensation and employee
             benefits. As a general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of
             an issuer's compensation and benefit policies and opposes
             excessive compensation, but believes that compensation matters are
             normally best determined by an issuer's board of directors, rather
             than shareholders. Proposals to "micro-manage" an issuer's
             compensation practices or to set arbitrary restrictions on
             compensation or benefits will, therefore, generally not be
             supported.

           * Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for
             approval of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital
             structure. As a general matter, the Committee will support
             requests that enhance the rights of common shareholders and oppose
             requests that appear to be unreasonably dilutive.

           * Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an
             issuer's charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee
             opposes poison pill provisions.

           * Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
             corporate meetings.

           * Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings
             of investment company shares. As with other types of companies,
             the Committee believes that a fund's board of directors (rather
             than its shareholders) is best positioned to set fund policy and
             oversee management. However, the Committee opposes granting boards
             of directors authority over certain matters, such as changes to a
             fund's investment objective, which the Investment Company Act
             envisions will be approved directly by shareholders.

           * Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner
             that relates to the shareholder's environmental or social
             concerns. The Committee generally believes that annual shareholder
             meetings are inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social
             issues, and opposes shareholder resolutions "micromanaging"
             corporate conduct or requesting release of information that would
             not help a shareholder evaluate an investment in the corporation
             as an economic matter. While the Committee is generally supportive
             of proposals to require corporate disclosure of matters that seem
             relevant and material to the economic interests of shareholders,
             the Committee is generally not supportive of proposals to require
             disclosure of corporate matters for other purposes.

           (iv) Potential Material Conflicts of Interest
</TABLE>


           BlackRock has built a professional working environment, firm-wide
           compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to
           protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over
           another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address
           the allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio
           transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential
           conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client
           accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock
           furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous
           clients in addition to the Fund, and BlackRock may, consistent with
           applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or
           accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have
           performance or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio
           managers have a personal interest in the receipt of such fees),
           which may be the same as or different from those made to the Fund.
           In addition, BlackRock, its affiliates and any officer, director,
           stockholder or employee may or may not have an interest in the
           securities whose purchase and sale BlackRock recommends to the Fund.
           BlackRock, or any of its affiliates, or any officer, director,
           stockholder, employee or any member of their families may take
           different actions than those recommended to the Fund by BlackRock
           with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock may refrain
           from rendering any advice or services concerning securities of
           companies of which any of BlackRock's (or its affiliates') officers,
           directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to
           which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or the officers, directors
           and employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest
           or possesses material non-public information. Each portfolio manager
           also may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be
           opposed to the strategy utilized for the Fund. In this connection,
           it should be noted that certain portfolio managers currently manage
           certain accounts that are subject to performance fees. In addition,
           certain portfolio managers assist in managing certain hedge funds
           and may be entitled to receive a portion of any incentive fees
           earned on such funds and a portion of such incentive fees may be
           voluntarily or involuntarily deferred. Additional portfolio managers
           may in the future manage other such accounts or funds and may be
           entitled to receive incentive fees.

           As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and
           must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells
           securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated
           in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts
           to allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client
           accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this
           end, BlackRock has adopted a policy that is intended to ensure that
           investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among
           client accounts over time. This policy also seeks to achieve
           reasonable efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock
           with sufficient flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that
           is consistent with the particular investment discipline and client
           base.

                (a)(3) As of December 31, 2006:

                Compensation Program (Messrs. Amero, Burger, Chen and Hussain)
                BlackRock's financial arrangements with its portfolio
           managers, its competitive compensation and its career path emphasis
           at all levels reflect the value senior management places on key
           resources. Compensation may include a variety of components and may
           vary from year to year based on a number of factors. The principal
           components of compensation include a base salary, a discretionary
           bonus, participation in various benefits programs and one or more of
           the incentive compensation programs established by BlackRock such as
           its Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan and Restricted Stock
           Program.

                Base Compensation
                Generally, portfolio managers receive base compensation based
           on their seniority and/or their position with the firm.

                Discretionary Compensation
                In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers may
           receive discretionary compensation, which can be a substantial
           portion of total compensation. Discretionary compensation can
           include a discretionary cash bonus as well as one or more of the
           following:

                Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP)
                The LTIP is a long-term incentive plan that seeks to reward
           certain key employees. The plan provides for the grant of awards
           that are expressed as an amount of cash that, if properly vested and
           subject to the attainment of certain performance goals, will be
           settled in cash and/or in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.

                Deferred Compensation Program
                A portion of the compensation paid to each portfolio manager
           may be voluntarily deferred by the portfolio manager into an account
           that tracks the performance of certain of the firm's investment
           products. Each portfolio manager is permitted to allocate his
           deferred amounts among various options, including to certain of the
           firm's hedge funds and other unregistered products. In addition,
           prior to 2005, a portion of the annual compensation of certain
           senior managers was mandatorily deferred in a similar manner for a
           number of years. Beginning in 2005, a portion of the annual
           compensation of certain senior managers was paid in the form of
           BlackRock, Inc. restricted stock units which vest ratably over a
           number of years.

                Options and Restricted Stock Awards
                While incentive stock options are not currently being awarded
           to BlackRock employees, BlackRock, Inc. previously granted stock
           options to key employees, including certain portfolio managers who
           may still hold unexercised or unvested options. BlackRock, Inc. also
           has a restricted stock award program designed to reward certain key
           employees as an incentive to contribute to the long-term success of
           BlackRock. These awards vest over a period of years.

                Incentive Savings Plans
                BlackRock, Inc. has created a variety of incentive savings
           plans in which BlackRock employees are eligible to participate,
           including a 401(k) plan, the BlackRock Retirement Savings Plan (RSP)
           and the BlackRock Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The employer
           contribution components of the RSP include a company match equal to
           50% of the first 6% of eligible pay contributed to the plan capped
           at $4,000 per year, and a company retirement contribution equal to
           3% of eligible compensation, plus an additional contribution of 2%
           for any year in which BlackRock has positive net operating income.
           The RSP offers a range of investment options, including registered
           investment companies managed by the firm. Company contributions
           follow the investment direction set by participants for their own
           contributions or absent, employee investment direction, are invested
           into a stable value fund.  The ESPP allows for investment in
           BlackRock common stock at a 5% discount on the fair market value of
           the stock on the purchase date.   Annual participation in the ESPP
           is limited to the purchase of 1,000 shares or a dollar value of
           $25,000.  Each portfolio manager is eligible to participate in these
           plans.

                Annual incentive compensation for each portfolio manager is a
           function of several components: the performance of BlackRock, Inc.,
           the performance of the portfolio manager's group within BlackRock,
           the investment performance, including risk-adjusted returns and
           income generation, of the firm's assets under management or
           supervision by that portfolio manager relative to predetermined
           benchmarks, and the individual's teamwork and contribution to the
           overall performance of these portfolios and BlackRock. Unlike many
           other firms, portfolio managers at BlackRock compete against
           benchmarks rather than each other. In most cases, including for the
           portfolio managers of the Registrant, these benchmarks are the same
           as the benchmark or benchmarks against which the investment
           performance, including risk-adjusted returns and income generation,
           of the Registrant or other accounts are measured. A group of
           BlackRock, Inc.'s officers determines which benchmarks against which
           to compare the performance of funds and other accounts managed by
           each portfolio manager.

                The group of BlackRock, Inc.'s officers then makes a
           subjective determination with respect to the portfolio manager's
           compensation based on the performance of the funds and other
           accounts managed by each portfolio manager relative to the various
           benchmarks. This determination may take into consideration the fact
           that a benchmark may not perfectly correlate to the way the
           Registrant or other accounts are managed, even if it is the
           benchmark that is most appropriate for the Registrant or other
           account. For example, a benchmark's return may be based on the total
           return of the securities comprising the benchmark, but the
           Registrant or other account may be managed to maximize income and
           not total return. Senior portfolio managers who perform additional
           management functions within BlackRock may receive additional
           compensation for serving in these other capacities.

           Compensation Program (Messrs. Martorelli and Rendino)
                The elements of total compensation for portfolio managers on
           BlackRock's Equity Investments team include a fixed base salary,
           annual performance-based cash and stock compensation (cash and stock
           bonus) and other benefits. BlackRock has balanced these components
           of pay to provide these portfolio managers with a powerful incentive
           to achieve consistently superior investment performance. By design,
           compensation levels for these portfolio managers fluctuate--both up
           and down--with the relative investment performance of the portfolios
           that they manage.

                Base compensation
                Like that of many asset management firms, base salaries
           represent a relatively small portion of a portfolio manager's total
           compensation. This approach serves to enhance the motivational value
           of the performance-based (and therefore variable) compensation
           elements of the compensation program.

                Performance-Based Compensation
                BlackRock believes that the best interests of investors are
           served by recruiting and retaining exceptional asset management
           talent and managing their compensation within a consistent and
           disciplined framework that emphasizes pay for performance in the
           context of an intensely competitive market for talent. To that end,
           BlackRock and its affiliates portfolio manager incentive
           compensation is based on a formulaic compensation program.
           BlackRock's formulaic portfolio manager compensation program
           includes: investment performance over 1-, 3- and 5-year performance
           periods and a measure of operational efficiency. Portfolio managers
           are compensated based on the pre-tax performance of the products
           they manage. If a portfolio manager's tenure is less than 5 years,
           performance periods will reflect time in position. Portfolio
           managers are compensated based on products they manage. A
           discretionary element of portfolio manager compensation may include
           consideration of: financial results, expense control, profit
           margins, strategic planning and implementation, quality of client
           service, market share, corporate reputation, capital allocation,
           compliance and risk control, leadership, workforce diversity,
           supervision, technology and innovation. All factors are considered
           collectively by BlackRock management.

                Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP)
                The LTIP is a long-term incentive plan that seeks to reward
           certain key employees. The plan provides for the grant of awards
           that are expressed as an amount of cash that, if properly vested and
           subject to the attainment of certain performance goals, will be
           settled in cash and/or in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.

                Cash Bonus
                Performance-based compensation is distributed to portfolio
           managers in a combination of cash and stock. Typically, the cash
           bonus, when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of
           total compensation for portfolio managers.

                Stock Bonus
                A portion of the dollar value of the total annual performance-
           based bonus is paid in restricted shares of BlackRock stock. Paying
           a portion of annual bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a
           portfolio manager for a given year "at risk" based on the company's
           ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods.
           The ultimate value of stock bonuses is dependent on future BlackRock
           stock price performance. As such, the stock bonus aligns each
           portfolio manager's financial interests with those of the BlackRock
           shareholders and encourages a balance between short-term goals and
           long-term strategic objectives. Management strongly believes that
           providing a significant portion of competitive performance-based
           compensation in stock is in the best interests of investors and
           shareholders. This approach ensures that portfolio managers
           participate as shareholders in both the "downside risk" and "upside
           opportunity" of the company's performance. Portfolio managers
           therefore have a direct incentive to protect BlackRock's reputation
           for integrity.

                Other Compensation Programs
                Portfolio managers who meet relative investment performance
           and financial management objectives during a performance year are
           eligible to participate in a deferred cash program. Awards under
           this program are in the form of deferred cash that may be
           benchmarked to a menu of BlackRock mutual funds (including their own
           fund) during a five-year vesting period. The deferred cash program
           aligns the interests of participating portfolio managers with the
           investment results of BlackRock products and promotes continuity of
           successful portfolio management teams.

                Other Benefits
                Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in broad-
           based plans offered generally to employees of BlackRock and its
           affiliates, including broad-based retirement, 401(k), health, and
           other employee benefit plans.

           (a)(4) Beneficial Ownership of Securities.    As of December 31,
                  2006, none of the managers listed below beneficially owns
                  any stock issued by the Fund:
                  Scott Amero
                  Kevin Rendino
                  Robert Martorelli
