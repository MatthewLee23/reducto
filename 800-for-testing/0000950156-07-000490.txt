LETTER FROM THE CEO

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Dear Shareholders:

The past year has been a great example of why investors should keep their eyes
on the long term.

In 2006 the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 19%. As of mid-May 2007, it
had returned another 8% and continued to reach new highs. But the Dow's upward
rise has not been without hiccups. After hitting new records in February, the
Dow lost 5.8% between February 20 and March 5, as stocks were sold off around
the globe. As we have said before, markets are volatile, and investors should
make sure they have an investment plan that can carry them through the peaks
and troughs.

If you are focused on a long-term investment strategy, the short-term ups and
downs of the markets should not necessarily dictate portfolio action on your
part. Both the bond and stock markets are cyclical. In our view, investors who
remain committed to a long-term plan are more likely to achieve their financial
goals. We believe you should not let the headlines guide you in your investment
decisions and should be cautious about overreacting to short-term volatility.

In any market environment, we believe individual investors are best served by
following a three-pronged investment strategy of allocating their holdings
across the major asset classes, diversifying within each class, and regularly
rebalancing their portfolios to maintain their desired allocations. Of course,
these strategies cannot guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.
Investing and planning for the long term require diligence and patience, two
traits that in our experience are essential to capitalizing on the many
opportunities the financial markets can offer -- through both up and down
economic cycles.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

    Robert J. Manning
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer
    MFS Investment Management(R)

    July 16, 2007

              ------------------------------------------------
              Average Life (i,m)                      6.3 yrs.

              Average Credit Quality of Rated
              Securities (long-term) (a)                   AAA
              ------------------------------------------------
              Average Credit Quality of Rated
              Securities (short-term) (a)                  A-1
              ------------------------------------------------

(a) The average credit quality of rated securities is based upon a market
    weighted average of portfolio holdings that are rated by public rating
    agencies.
(d) Duration is a measure of how much a bond's price is likely to fluctuate
    with general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a bond
    with a 5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
(i) For purposes of this presentation, the bond component includes both accrued
    interest amounts and the equivalent exposure from any derivative holdings,
    if applicable.
(m) The average maturity shown is calculated using the final stated maturity on
    the portfolio's holdings without taking into account any holdings which
    have been pre- refunded or pre-paid to an earlier date or which have a
    mandatory put date prior to the stated maturity. The average life shown
    takes into account these earlier dates.
(r) Each security is assigned a rating from Moody's Investors Service. If not
    rated by Moody's, the rating will be that assigned by Standard & Poor's.
    Likewise, if not assigned a rating by Standard & Poor's, it will be based
    on the rating assigned by Fitch, Inc. For those portfolios that hold a
    security which is not rated by any of the three agencies, the security is
    considered Not Rated. Holdings in U.S. Treasuries and government agency
    mortgage-backed securities, if any, are included in the "AAA"-rating
    category. Percentages are based on the total market value of investments as
    of 05/31/07.

Percentages are based on net assets as of 05/31/07, unless otherwise noted.

The portfolio is actively managed and current holdings may be different.

INDEX DEFINITION

Lehman Brothers U.S. Government/Mortgage Bond Index - measures debt issued by
the U.S. Government, and its agencies, as well as mortgage-backed pass-through
securities of Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC).

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount to net asset value. Shareholders do
not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their shares at net asset
value. The trust's shares also may trade at a premium to their net asset
value.

When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset value
underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive less
than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As a
result, the total returns that are calculated based on the net asset value and
New York Stock Exchange prices can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes
as a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her
shares and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be
treated as gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of
shareholder capital have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and may
increase the trust's expense ratio.

From time to time the trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements,
without which performance would be lower.

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on
such terms as the Trustees shall determine.
<PAGE>

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows
you to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If
the shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted
price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in
any amount over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the transaction expenses, including
commissions. The automatic reinvestment of distributions does not relieve
you of any income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on the
distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.
When you withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested
shares in one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional
shares, or a certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional
shares.

Effective May 1, 2007, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the Transfer Agent
for the trust) became the agent for the plan.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the trust's financial performance for the semiannual period
and the past 5 fiscal years. Certain information reflects financial results for a single trust share. The total returns in the
table represent the rate by which an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the trust share class (assuming
reinvestment of all distributions) held for the entire period.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited)

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the trust) is organized as a Massachusetts
business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, as a closed-end diversified management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The trust
can invest in foreign securities, including securities of emerging market
issuers. Investments in foreign securities are vulnerable to the effects of
changes in the relative values of the local currency and the U.S. dollar and to
the effects of changes in each country's legal, political, and economic
environment. The markets of emerging markets countries are generally more
volatile than the markets of developed countries with more mature economies.
All of the risks of investing in foreign securities previously described are
heightened when investing in emerging markets countries.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Debt instruments (other than short-term instruments),
including restricted debt instruments, are generally valued at an evaluated or
composite bid as reported by an independent pricing service. Short-term
instruments with a maturity at issuance of 60 days or less may be valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value. Futures contracts are
generally valued at last posted settlement price as reported by an independent
pricing service on the market on which they are primarily traded. Futures
contracts for which there were no trades that day for a particular position are
generally valued at the closing bid quotation as reported by an independent
pricing service on the market on which such futures contracts are primarily
traded. Forward foreign currency contracts are generally valued at the mean of
bid and asked prices for the time period interpolated from rates reported by an
independent pricing service for proximate time periods. Securities and other
assets generally valued on the basis of information from an independent pricing
service may also be valued at a broker-dealer bid quotation. Values obtained
from pricing services can utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and
electronic data processing techniques, which take into account factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics, and other market
data. The values of foreign securities and other assets and liabilities
expressed in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using the mean of
bid and asked prices for rates reported by an independent pricing service.

The Board of Trustees has delegated primary responsibility for determining or
causing to be determined the value of the trust's investments (including any
fair valuation) to the adviser pursuant to valuation policies and procedures
approved by the Board. If the adviser determines that reliable market
quotations are not readily available, investments are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by the adviser in accordance with such procedures
under the oversight of the Board of Trustees. Under the trust's valuation
policies and procedures, market quotations are not considered to be readily
available for many types of debt instruments and certain types of derivatives.
These investments are generally valued at fair value based on information from
independent pricing services. In addition, investments may be valued at fair
value if the adviser determines that an investment's value has been materially
affected by events occurring after the close of the exchange or market on which
the investment is principally traded (such as foreign exchange or market) and
prior to the determination of the trust's net asset value, or after the halting
of trading of a specific security where trading does not resume prior to the
close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded.
The adviser may rely on independent pricing services or other information (such
as the correlation with price movements of similar securities in the same or
other markets; the type, cost and investment characteristics of the security;
the business and financial condition of the issuer; and trading and other
market data) to assist in determining whether to fair value and at what value
to fair value an investment. The value of an investment for purposes of
calculating the trust's net asset value can differ depending on the source and
method used to determine value. When fair valuation is used, the value of
investments used to determine the trust's net asset value may differ from
quoted or published prices for the same investments.

In September 2006, FASB Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (the
"Statement") was issued, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007 and for all interim periods within those fiscal years. This
Statement provides a single definition of fair value, a hierarchy for measuring
fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. Management
is evaluating the application of the Statement to the trust, and believes the
impact will be limited to expanded disclosures resulting from the adoption of
this Statement in the trust's financial statements.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the trust's investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The trust requires
that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be transferred to
the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the trust to obtain those
securities in the event of a default under the repurchase agreement. The trust
monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral to ensure that its
value, including accrued interest, is greater than amounts owed to the trust
under each such repurchase agreement. The trust and other funds managed by
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS), may utilize a joint trading
account for the purpose of entering into one or more repurchase agreements.

INFLATION-ADJUSTED DEBT SECURITIES - The trust invests in inflation-adjusted
debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. The trust may also invest in
inflation-adjusted debt securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and
instrumentalities other than the U.S. Treasury and by other entities such as
U.S. and foreign corporations and foreign governments. The principal value of
these debt securities is adjusted by references to changes in the Consumer
Price Index or another general price or wage index. These debt securities
typically pay a fixed rate of interest, but this fixed rate is applied to the
inflation-adjusted principal amount. The principal paid at maturity of the debt
security is typically equal to the inflation-adjusted principal amount, or the
security's original par value, whichever is greater. Other types of
inflation-adjusted securities may use other methods to adjust for other
measures of inflation.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Purchases and sales of foreign investments,
income, and expenses are converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency
exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Gains
and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange rates on sales of
securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains
and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to foreign exchange
rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for financial statement
purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. That portion of both
realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.

DERIVATIVE RISK - The trust may invest in derivatives for hedging or non-
hedging purposes. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also
reduce or eliminate gains. When the trust uses derivatives as an investment to
gain market exposure, or for hedging purposes, gains and losses from derivative
instruments may be substantially greater than the derivative's original cost.
Derivative instruments include futures contracts and forward foreign currency
exchange contracts.

FUTURES CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into futures contracts for the delayed
delivery of securities or currency, or contracts based on financial indices at
a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the trust is
required to deposit with the broker either in cash or securities an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are
made or received by the trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the contract, and are recorded for financial statement purposes as
unrealized gains or losses by the trust. Upon entering into such contracts, the
trust bears the risk of interest or exchange rates or securities prices moving
unexpectedly, in which case, the trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits
of the futures contracts and may realize a loss.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to
meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value
of the contract. The trust may enter into forward foreign currency exchange
contracts for hedging purposes as well as for non-hedging purposes. For hedging
purposes, the trust may enter into contracts to deliver or receive foreign
currency it will receive from or require for its normal investment activities.
The trust may also use contracts in a manner intended to protect foreign
currency denominated securities from declines in value due to unfavorable
exchange rate movements. For non-hedging purposes, the trust may enter into
contracts with the intent of changing the relative exposure of the trust's
portfolio of securities to different currencies to take advantage of
anticipated changes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are
adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the underlying currency and any gains or
losses are recorded as unrealized until the contract settlement date. On
contract settlement date, the gains or losses are recorded as realized gains or
losses on foreign currency transactions.

INDEMNIFICATIONS - Under the trust's organizational documents, its officers and
trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and expenses arising
out of the performance of their duties to the trust. Additionally, in the
normal course of business, the trust enters into agreements with service
providers that may contain indemnification clauses. The trust's maximum
exposure under these agreements is unknown as this would involve future claims
that may be made against the trust that have not yet occurred.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All discount is
accreted for tax reporting purposes as required by federal income tax
regulations.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
trust. This amount, for the six months ended May 31, 2007, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust intends to qualify as a regulated
investment company, as defined under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code,
and to distribute all of its taxable income, including realized capital gains.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is required in the financial
statements. Foreign taxes, if any, have been accrued by the trust in the
accompanying financial statements.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are
periodically adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax
character. These adjustments have no impact on net assets or net asset value
per share. Temporary differences which arise from recognizing certain items of
income, expense, gain or loss in different periods for financial statement and
tax purposes will reverse at some time in the future. Distributions in excess
of net investment income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions
for financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition
or classification of income or distributions for financial statement and tax
purposes.

Book/tax differences primarily relate to amortization and accretion of debt
securities, straddle loss deferrals, and foreign currency transactions.

The tax character of distributions made during the current period will be
determined at fiscal year end. The tax character of distributions declared to
shareholders is as follows:

                                                            11/30/06

          capital gains)                                 $18,296,971

In June 2006, FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes (the "Interpretation") was issued, and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as
of the effective date. On December 22, 2006, the SEC delayed the implementation
of the Interpretation for regulated investment companies for an additional six
months. This Interpretation prescribes a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return, and requires certain expanded disclosures. Management
has evaluated the application of the Interpretation to the trust, and has
determined that there is no impact resulting from the adoption of this
Interpretation on the trust's financial statements.

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with MFS to
provide overall investment management and related administrative services and
facilities to the trust. The management fee is computed daily and paid monthly
at an annual rate of 0.32% of the trust's average daily net assets and 5.33% of
gross income. Gross income is calculated based on tax elections that generally
include the accretion of discount and exclude the amortization of premium,
which may differ from investment income reported in the Statement of
Operations. The management fee, from net assets and gross income, incurred for
the six months ended May 31, 2007 was equivalent to an annual effective rate of
0.62% of the trust's average daily net assets.

TRANSFER AGENT - Prior to December 18, 2006, MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of MFS, received a fee from the trust for its services
as registrar and dividend-disbursing agent. Pursuant to a written agreement,
the trust paid MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00 and a
dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. Effective December 18, 2006,
the trust has engaged Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") as
the sole transfer agent for the trust. MFSC will continue to monitor and
supervise the activities of Computershare for an agreed upon fee approved by
the Board of Trustees. For the six months ended May 31, 2007, these fees paid
to MFSC amounted to $18,883. MFSC also receives payment from the trust for
out-of-pocket expenses paid by MFSC on behalf of the trust. For the six months
ended May 31, 2007, these costs amounted to $20,907.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to the trust.
Under an administrative services agreement, the trust partially reimburses MFS
the costs incurred to provide these services. The trust is charged a fixed
amount plus a fee based on calendar year average net assets. The trust's annual
fixed amount is $17,500.

The administrative services fee incurred for the six months ended May 31, 2007
was equivalent to an annual effective rate of 0.0199% of the trust's average
daily net assets.

TRUSTEES' AND OFFICERS' COMPENSATION - The trust pays compensation to
independent trustees in the form of a retainer, attendance fees, and additional
compensation to Board and Committee chairpersons. The trust does not pay
compensation directly to trustees or to officers of the trust who are also
officers of the investment adviser, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the trust from MFS. Certain officers and trustees of the trust are
officers or directors of MFS and MFSC. The trust has an unfunded, defined
benefit plan for certain retired independent trustees which resulted in a
pension expense of $4,926. The trust also has an unfunded retirement benefit
deferral plan for certain independent trustees which resulted in an expense of
$1,626. Both amounts are included in independent trustees' compensation for the
six months ended May 31, 2007. The liability for deferred retirement benefits
payable to certain independent trustees under both plans amounted to $164,657
at May 31, 2007, and is included in payable for independent trustees'
compensation.

DEFERRED TRUSTEE COMPENSATION - Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan)
independent trustees previously were allowed to elect to defer receipt of all
or a portion of their annual compensation. Trustees are no longer allowed to
defer compensation under the Plan. Amounts previously deferred are treated as
though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of certain MFS
funds selected by the trustee. Deferred amounts represent an unsecured
obligation of the trust until distributed in accordance with the Plan. Included
in other assets and payable for independent trustees' compensation is $12,790
of deferred trustees' compensation.

OTHER - This trust and certain other MFS funds (the funds) have entered into a
services agreement (the Agreement) which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an
Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an
officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. The funds can
terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the
Agreement. For the six months ended May 31, 2007, the fee paid to Tarantino LLC
was $1,433. MFS has agreed to reimburse the trust for a portion of the payments
made by the funds to Tarantino LLC in the amount of $926, which is shown as a
reduction of total expenses in the Statement of Operations. Additionally, MFS
has agreed to bear all expenses associated with office space, other
administrative support, and supplies provided to the ICCO.

number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized the repurchase by the trust of up to 10% annually of its own shares
of beneficial interest. During the six months ended May 31, 2007, the trust did
not repurchase any shares. The trust repurchased and retired 782,600 shares of
beneficial interest during the year ended November 30, 2006 at an average price
per share of $6.41 and a weighted average discount of 10.50% per share.

  Treasury shares reacquired       --            $--    (782,600)   $(5,014,933)

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other funds managed by MFS participate in a $1 billion unsecured
committed line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a credit
agreement. In addition, the trust and other funds managed by MFS have
established uncommitted borrowing arrangements with certain banks. Borrowings
may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to each fund,
based on its borrowings, generally at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve funds
rate plus 0.30%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average daily,
unused portion of the committed line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. For the six months
ended May 31, 2007, the trust's commitment fee and interest expense were $1,565
and $922, respectively, and are included in miscellaneous expense on the
Statement of Operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Government Markets Income Trust:

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of MFS
Government Markets Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of May 31, 2007, and the related statement of operations,
changes in net assets, and financial highlights for the six-month period ended
May 31, 2007. These interim financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Trust's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making
inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should
be made to the accompanying interim financial statements and financial
highlights referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of changes in
net assets for the year ended November 30, 2006, and financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period ended November 30, 2006, and in our report
dated January 18, 2007, we expressed an unqualified opinion on such statement
of changes in net assets and financial highlights.

Note: The Board of Trustees approves procedures to repurchase Fund shares
annually. The notification to shareholders of the program is included in the
semi-annual and annual reports sent to shareholders. These annual programs
begin on March 1st of each year. The programs conform to the conditions of Rule
10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of
Fund shares that may be repurchased in each annual period (March 1 through the
following February 28) to 10% of the Registrant's outstanding shares as of the
first day of the plan year (March 1). The aggregate number of Fund shares
available for repurchase for the March 1, 2007 plan year is 5,133,256.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may send
recommendations to the Board for nominees to the Registrant's Board since the
Registrant last provided disclosure as to such procedures in response to the
requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-K (as required by Item
22(b)(15) of Schedule 14A), or this Item.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Based upon their evaluation of the effectiveness of the registrant's
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the
    Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act")) as conducted within 90 days of
    the filing date of this report on Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal
    financial officer and principal executive officer have concluded that
    those disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that
    the material information required to be disclosed by the registrant on
    this report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
    time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
    and forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal controls over financial
    reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during
    the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by the report that have
    materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
    registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
    exhibits in the sequence indicated.

    (1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
        disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant
        intends to satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an
        exhibit.

    (2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule
        30a-2 under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2): Attached hereto.

(b) If the report is filed under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act,
    provide the certifications required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the Act (17 CFR
    270.30a-2(b)), Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) under the Exchange Act (17
    CFR 240.13a-14(b) or 240.15d-14(b)) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of
    Title 18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) as an exhibit. A
    certification furnished pursuant to this paragraph will not be deemed
    "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
    78r), or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. Such
    certification will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any
    filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except to the
    extent that the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference:
    Attached hereto.
