President's Letter

U.S. markets have continued to generate positive returns during the first
several months of 2017, with so-called "risk" assets, such as equities and
credit-sensitive bonds, posting solid gains. U.S. equities, as measured by the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index, returned slightly more than 6% in the first
calendar quarter of the year and more than 3% for the second quarter. Meanwhile,
high-yield securities have dominated bond market performance thus far in 2017.

The post-election market momentum we witnessed in the U.S. during the final
weeks of the fourth quarter of 2016 slowed only when oil prices slumped in
March, due to both higher-than-expected inventories and concerns over whether
OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) would continue its supply
cuts. Not even the Federal Reserve System's (the Fed's) two rate hikes since
March, nor Britain's trigger of Article 50 to begin the "Brexit" process caused
any dramatic sell-off of risk assets. In fact, we are encouraged by the more
hawkish stance of the Fed with regard to interest rates, in light of our view
that current U.S. bond yields do not fairly reflect the prospective levels of
economic activity and inflation. We expect the Fed to continue to tighten
monetary policy, with at least one more rate hike likely to occur before the end
of 2017.

While U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) did slow in the first quarter, ending
up at 1.4% after revisions, the expectation is for GDP growth to pick-up in the
second quarter, with a solid consumer leading the way. It is our view that the
U.S. economy may lead all developed nations in 2017, with GDP growth in
excess of 2% for the full year, even if proposed tax and regulatory reforms are
not passed into law in the near future. We also believe solid domestic
employment figures should continue to support consumption and the housing
market, and that stronger corporate profits and increased government
spending may contribute to economic growth in 2018 and beyond. In addition,
as we monitor global Purchasing Manager Indices (PMIs), we note that their
numbers are increasing, which suggests that growth in global economies is also
improving. (PMIs are used to measure the economic health of the
manufacturing sector.)

There are, as always, some risks to our outlook. First, the market already has
priced in a good deal of the Trump economic reform platform, and that could
lead to near-term disappointment if Congressional follow-through does not
happen this year. The future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is another
potential concern, as Congressional leaders have, thus far, failed to generate

2 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17
<PAGE>

enough support to get new health care legislation approved by both houses.
However, if a bill is eventually passed that either eliminates or significantly
alters the ACA, the new law will undoubtedly have an effect on the health care
sector, one of the largest segments of the U.S. economy. Geopolitical risks, of
course, remain a potential headwind, given ongoing strife in the Middle East and
renewed tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

While our current outlook is generally optimistic, conditions can and often do
change, and while passive investment strategies may have a place in one's
overall portfolio, it is our view that all investment decisions are active
choices.

Throughout our history, we have believed in the importance of active
management. The active decisions to invest in equities or fixed-income
securities are made by a team of experienced investment professionals focusing
on identifying value across global markets using proprietary research, careful
risk management, and a long-term perspective. We believe our shareowners
can benefit from the experience and tenure of our investment teams as well as
the insights generated from our extensive research process.

As always, and particularly during times of market uncertainty, we encourage
you to work with your financial advisor to develop an overall investment plan
that addresses both your short- and long-term goals, and to implement such a
plan in a disciplined manner.

We greatly appreciate the trust you have placed in us and look forward to
continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,

/s/ Lisa M. Jones

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/17

Important Note: On July 3, 2017, Amundi acquired Pioneer Investments, a group of
asset management companies located throughout the world. Amundi, one of the
world's largest asset managers, is headquartered in Paris, France. As a result
of the transaction, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc., the Trust's investment
adviser, became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Amundi and Amundi's
wholly owned subsidiary, Amundi USA, Inc. Prior to July 3, 2017, Pioneer
Investments was owned by Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., a wholly owned
subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A.

In connection with the transaction, the names of the Trust's investment
adviser and principal underwriter changed. Effective July 3, 2017, the name of
Pioneer Investment Management, Inc., changed to Amundi Pioneer Asset
Management, Inc., and the name of Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc., changed
to Amundi Pioneer Distributor, Inc.

This transaction does not impact your existing relationship with Pioneer
Investments, your advisor, or the methods you use to communicate with us, as the
investor contact telephone numbers and services you expect will remain the same.
We are excited, however, to be launching a new website representing the combined
company. Come visit us at: www.amundipioneer.com

After a late-year rally lifted the prices of most bank-loan investments in
December 2016, prices settled into a more stable pattern for the remainder of
the six-month period ended May 31, 2017. In the following interview, Jonathan
Sharkey discusses the factors that affected the performance of Pioneer Floating
Rate Trust during the six-month period. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice president and
a portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc. (Amundi Pioneer),
is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q    How did the Trust perform during the six-month period ended May 31, 2017?

A    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 3.48% at net asset value (NAV) and
     4.30% at market price during the six-month period ended May 31, 2017, while
     the Trust's benchmark, the Standard & Poor's/Loan Syndications & Trading
     Association Leveraged Loan Index (the S&P/LSTA Index), returned 3.14%.
     Unlike the Trust, the S&P/LSTA Index does not use leverage. While the use
     of leverage increases investment opportunity, it also increases investment
     risk. During the same six-month period, the average return (at market
     price) of the 34 closed end funds in Lipper's Loan Participation Funds
     category (which may or may not be leveraged), was 7.22%, and the average
     return (at NAV) of the 38 closed end funds in the same Lipper category was
     4.30%. For the 12-month period ended May 31, 2017, the Trust returned 8.19%
     at NAV and 13.43% at market price, while

4 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17
<PAGE>

     the Trust's linked benchmark returned 7.65% and the S&P/LSTA Index returned
     7.49%. (See footnote on Page 12 for information about the Trust's linked
     benchmark).

     The shares of the Trust were selling at a 5.02% discount to net asset value
     on May 31, 2017. Comparatively, the shares of the Trust were selling at a
     5.76% discount to net asset value on November 30, 2016, the end of the
     Trust's previous annual reporting period.

     The Trust's standard, 30-day SEC yield was 4.34% on May 31, 2017*.

Q    How would you describe the investment environment for bank loans during the
     six-month period ended May 31, 2017?

A    The six-month period began in the midst of a rally triggered by the
     November 2016 U.S. elections. The victory of Republican Donald J. Trump in
     the 2016 presidential election and the successful effort of Republicans
     (GOP) to retain control of both houses of Congress sparked gains in the
     credit sectors, including bank loans. Mr. Trump had campaigned on an
     economic platform of lower taxes, reduced regulations, and increased
     infrastructure spending. If enacted, those policies had the potential to
     spur an acceleration in economic growth, and the markets reacted
     accordingly, as investors bid-up the prices of bank loans and other
     credit-sensitive investments as 2016 drew to a close. In the first five
     months of 2017, however, market conditions settled down and prices
     stabilized. As a consequence, the returns of floating-rate bank loans
     tended to be defined principally by the current yield, or income,
     distributed by the loans to investors.

     Overall, the fundamentals of bank loans were solid during the six-month
     period. The U.S. economy continued to grow at a modest pace, while the job
     market continued to improve. In general, the credit-worthiness of
     loan-based investments strengthened in the expanding economy and loan
     default rates remained low. Investor demand for bank loans persisted, while
     the supply of new loans remained somewhat muted. With strong demand
     outstripping loan supply, prices appreciated, with 70% of existing loans
     trading above par (face) value. On the negative side, however, many
     existing bank loans were repriced into lower-yielding loans over the
     six-month period.

Q    What factors affected the Trust's performance relative to the benchmark
     S&P/LSTA Index during the six-month period ended May 31, 2017?

A    The Trust slightly outperformed the benchmark S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index
     during the six-month period, with benchmark-relative performance aided by
     the use of leverage, or borrowed funds. The Trust's benchmark-relative
     performance was held back, however, by the portfolio's tilt in favor of
     higher-quality loans, as lower-quality loans rallied more

*    The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized formula that is based on the
     hypothetical annualized earning power (investment income only) of the
     Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

                     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17 5
<PAGE>

     than higher-quality loans over the period. We maintained our preference
     for higher-quality loans in the Trust's portfolio because we continue to
     believe they can provide more reliable and consistent returns for risk-
     conscious investors over the longer term. On May 31, 2017, just 3.5% of
     the Trust's total investment portfolio was allocated to loans rated CCC or
     below. Meanwhile, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index had a 6%
     allocation in CCC-rated loans. Similarly, the Trust's portfolio was
     slightly underweight in second-lien loans as compared with the benchmark.

     At the industry level, the Trust's exposure to health care loans helped
     benchmark-relative results during the period, as the portfolio was
     moderately overweight in that outperforming group. Good security selection
     within the Trust's allocation to information technology loans also
     supported benchmark-relative performance, despite the fact that the
     portfolio had a modest underweight to that outperforming sector.
     Conversely, the Trust's exposures to retailing and cosmetics, two
     weak-performing groups over the six-month period, detracted from absolute
     returns, even though the portfolio was heavily underweight in each of those
     sectors.

Q    Which individual investments had notable effects, either positively or
     negatively, on the Trust's performance during the six-month period ended
     May 31, 2017?

A    Individual portfolio holdings that contributed positively to the Trust's
     performance during the period included loans to Dixie Electric, Accudyne
     Industries, and Mill U.S. Acquisition. Dixie Electric provides electrical
     services to oil-field services operators and other industries, while
     Accudyne produces pumps, compressors, and other equipment for large scale
     industrial uses. Mill U.S. Acquisition, also known as CSM Bakery, supplies
     products to the baking industry. Other investments that helped the Trust's
     performance during the period included a position in loans to defense
     contractor IAP Worldwide, which went through a financial restructuring
     that resulted in the Trust's gaining a small equity position. Positions in
     two event-linked insurance bonds also supported the Trust's results, as did
     an investment in the high-yield bonds of Community Health, a rural hospital
     chain.

     Portfolio investments that were less successful for the Trust during the
     period included loans to Cengage Learning, a textbook publisher that felt
     the effects of softening of demand throughout the industry; Concordia
     Healthcare, a diversified pharmaceutical company that saw a weakening of
     demand both in the United States and the United Kingdom; and Altisource, a
     processing service provider to financial companies that was affected by the
     problems of one major client.

<PAGE>

Q    How did the level of leverage in the Trust change over the six-month period
     ended May 31, 2017?

A    The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. (See Note 7
     to the financial statements).

     At the end of the six-month period on May 31, 2017, 31.6% of the Trust's
     total managed assets were financed by leverage (or borrowed funds),
     compared with 31.7% of the Trust's total managed assets financed by
     leverage at the start of the period on December 1, 2016. The absolute
     amount of funds borrowed by the Trust did not change during the period. The
     reduction in the percentage of leveraged funds was the result of
     appreciation in the values of the Trust's holdings.

Q    Did the Trust invest in any derivative securities during the six-month
     period ended May 31, 2017? If so, did the investments have an effect on
     performance?

A    Yes, during the period we took a small position in high-yield bond credit
     default swaps as a way to deploy cash in the Trust's portfolio, at par
     value, while waiting for the loan new-issue calendar to resurge. The swaps
     also gave the Trust some exposure to high-yield bonds. The investment did
     not have a material impact on performance.

Q    What factors affected the Trust's distributions to shareowners during the
     six-month period ended May 31, 2017?

A    The Trust's distributions remained stable during the period. Shareowners
     should be aware, however, that several factors could affect future
     distributions. As older loans with higher yields are repriced at lower
     spreads, newer loans in the Trust's portfolio may pay less current income
     to the Trust. (Loan spreads are the interest rates over and above the
     London Interbank Offered Rate - or LIBOR rate - charged to borrowers by
     banks.)

     Potentially offsetting these influences is the prospect that short-term
     interest rates will continue to increase due to tightening of monetary
     policy by the Federal Reserve System (the Fed), which has raised the
     Federal funds rate three times since December 2016. If there are more rate
     increases by the Fed over the next several months, the income paid by
     floating-rate loans may also start increasing, which could result in
     greater current income for the Trust, as rates could exceed the LIBOR
     floors in the portfolio.

Q    What is your investment outlook?

A    We have a positive outlook for bank-loan investments. While U.S. gross
     domestic product (GDP) registered a disappointing 1.4% growth rate during
     the first quarter of this year, we believe the U.S. economy should

                     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17 7
<PAGE>

     continue to strengthen, with GDP growing at a 2% (or better) annual pace
     for 2017. We also expect to see persistently strong investor demand for
     bank loans as the Fed continues to tighten monetary policy by raising the
     Federal funds rate.

     The past six months saw a wave of loan refinancings that we believe may
     signal a change in the dynamics of the loan market as well as in the types
     of gains that may be expected from loan investments. During the period,
     one- quarter of the loans S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index were refinanced
     into new loans with lower spreads. The new loans, because of their lower
     interest rates, may prove less likely to appreciate in price. During 2016,
     half the returns from bank-loan investments came from price appreciation,
     with the other half coming from interest distributions. In the future, we
     believe a smaller percentage of bank-loan earnings may come from price
     appreciation, with interest income becoming the primary source of earnings.

     We continue to believe that bank loans can create solid opportunities for
     income-oriented investors. At period end, the credit-quality of the loan
     asset class was good, with loan default rates remaining well below
     historical averages. We think overall default rates should remain
     relatively low, although we anticipate there may be some defaults in the
     retail sector as online sellers continue to take business from traditional
     "brick-and-mortar" retailers.

     We continue to significantly overweight asset-intensive industries such as
     building materials and industrial equipment in the Trust's portfolio, while
     de-emphasizing loans to retailers and technology companies. Retailers
     continue to lose market share, while technology firms remain vulnerable to
     fast-moving industry changes.

     We believe our preference for holding higher-quality loans in asset-
     intensive industries positions the Trust well for the present environment,
     while rising short-term interest rates have the potential to increase the
     dividend** income generated by bank loans.

**   Dividends are not guaranteed.

volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity, and heightened
uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen, or spread.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency
exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to attempt
to increase the Trust's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered
speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. Using derivatives can
increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when the market prices,
interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves behave in a way not
anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can increase price
fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities which may be less liquid or
illiquid. Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of
their value at times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the
market price of illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of more
liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and investment
of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to
take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage creates
significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital
appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage will not
be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
return for shareowners.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment
portfolio or take other actions at what might be inopportune times in the
market. Such actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners
over time, which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the
Trust's shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit www.amundipioneer.com for the most recent month-end
performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the
performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.
There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds
are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently
trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per share is total assets less total
liabilities, which include preferred shares, or borrowings, as applicable,
divided by the number of shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained through open-market purchases under
the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and,
unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. The
indices do not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

***  The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the Bloomberg Barclays
     Index) was the Trust's benchmark from inception through 9/30/16, when the
     Bloomberg Barclays Index ceased. As of 10/1/16, the Trust's benchmark is
     the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index (the S&P/LSTA Index). Both the Bloomberg
     Barclays Index and the S&P/LSTA Index provide, or provided, broad and
     comprehensive total return metrics of the U.S. universe of syndicated term
     loans. Ten-year, five-year, and one-year "linked" benchmark returns shown
     above represent the combination of the Bloomberg Barclays Index's returns
     from 6/1/07 through 9/30/16, and the S&P/LSTA Index's returns from 10/1/16
     through 5/31/17.

+    Value of $10,000 investment figures for the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High
     Yield Loans Index covers the period from May 2007 through September 30,
     2016.

                similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
                risks, etc.). See Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

     Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
                assumptions in determining fair value of investments). See
                Notes to Financial Statements -- Note 1A.

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The investment
objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income and the
Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the
extent consistent with its investment objective of high current income.

On July 3, 2017, Amundi acquired Pioneer Investments, a group of asset
management companies located throughout the world. Amundi, one of the world's
largest asset managers, is headquartered in Paris, France. As a result of the
transaction, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc., the Trust's investment
adviser, became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Amundi and Amundi's
wholly owned subsidiary, Amundi USA, Inc. Prior to July 3, 2017, Pioneer
Investments was owned by Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., a wholly owned
subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A.

In connection with the transaction, the names of the Trust's investment adviser
and principal underwriter changed. Effective July 3, 2017, the name of Pioneer
Investment Management, Inc. changed to Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc. and
the name of Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc. changed to Amundi Pioneer
Distributor, Inc.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) that require the management
of the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income,
expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

The Trust is an investment company and follows investment company accounting and
reporting guidance under U.S. GAAP. The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial
statements:

A.   Security Valuation

     The net asset value of the Trust is computed once daily, on each day the
     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open, as of the close of regular trading
     on the NYSE.

     Fixed income securities are valued by using prices supplied by independent
     pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices, market
     events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
     maturities and ratings, or may use a pricing matrix or other fair value
     methods or techniques to provide an estimated value of the security or
     instrument. A pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on the
     basis of current market prices for other debt securities, historical
     trading patterns in the market for fixed income securities and/or other
     factors. Non-U.S. debt securities that are listed on an exchange will be
     valued at the bid price obtained from an independent third party pricing
     service. When independent third party pricing services are unable to supply
     prices, or when prices or market quotations are considered to be
     unreliable, the value of that security may be determined using quotations
     from one or more broker-dealers.

     Loan interests are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the
     Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked
     prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing
     Corporation, an independent third party pricing service. If price
     information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation, or if the price
     information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be obtained
     from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable price
     quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing
     service, broker quotes will be solicited.

     Event-linked bonds or catastrophe bonds are valued at the bid price
     obtained from an independent third party pricing service. Other insurance
     linked securities (including sidecars, collateralized reinsurance and
     industry loss warranties) may be valued at the bid price obtained from an
     independent pricing service, or through a third party using a pricing
     matrix, insurance industry valuation models, or other fair value methods or
     techniques to provide an estimated value of the instrument.

     Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are valued by using the
     last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Equity
     securities that have not traded on the date of valuation, or securities for
     which sale prices are not available, generally are valued using the mean
     between the last bid and asked prices or, if both last bid and asked prices
     are not available, at the last quoted bid price. Last sale and bid and
     asked prices are provided by

52 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17
<PAGE>

     independent third party pricing services. In the case of equity securities
     not traded on an exchange, prices are typically determined by independent
     third party pricing services using a variety of techniques and methods.

     The value of foreign securities is translated in U.S. dollars based on
     foreign currency exchange rate quotations supplied by a third party pricing
     source. Trading in non-U.S. equity securities is substantially completed
     each day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of
     such securities used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares
     are determined as of such times. The Trust may use a fair value model
     developed by an independent pricing service to value non-U.S. equity
     securities.

     Swap agreements, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors (other than
     centrally cleared swap agreements) are valued at the dealer quotations
     obtained from reputable International Swap Dealers Association members.
     Centrally cleared swaps are valued at the daily settlement price provided
     by the central clearing counterparty.

     Shares of open-end registered investment companies (including money market
     mutual funds) are valued at such funds' net asset value. Repurchase
     agreements are valued at par. Cash may include overnight time deposits at
     approved financial institutions.

     Securities or loan interests for which independent pricing services or
     broker-dealers are unable to supply prices or for which market prices
     and/or quotations are not readily available or are considered to be
     unreliable are valued by a fair valuation team comprised of certain
     personnel of Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc. (Amundi Pioneer),
     formerly Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM), the Trust's investment
     adviser and pursuant to procedures adopted by the Trust's Board of
     Trustees. Amundi Pioneer's, formerly PIM's, fair valuation team uses fair
     value methods approved by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees.
     Amundi Pioneer's, formerly PIM's, fair valuation team is responsible for
     monitoring developments that may impact fair valued securities and for
     discussing and assessing fair values on an ongoing basis, and at least
     quarterly, with the Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees.

     Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may
     include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
     market conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value
     methods if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after the
     close of the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior to
     the determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a significant
     event might include political or economic news, corporate restructurings,
     natural

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17 53
<PAGE>

     disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts. Thus, the valuation of the
     Trust's securities may differ significantly from exchange prices and such
     differences could be material.

     At May 31, 2017, four securities were valued using fair value methods (in
     addition to securities valued using prices supplied by independent pricing
     services, broker-dealers or using a third party insurance pricing model)
     representing 1.0% of net assets. The value of these fair valued securities
     are $3,091,769.

B.   Investment Income and Transactions

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
     dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
     passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
     data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Interest income, including
     interest on income bearing cash accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis,
     net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at the applicable country
     rates.

     Discounts and premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted
     or amortized, respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective
     yield to maturity basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the
     cost basis of the security. Premiums and discounts related to certain
     mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the
     monthly paydowns.

     Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Gains and losses on
     sales of investments are calculated on the identified cost method for both
     financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.   Foreign Currency Translation

     The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
     denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
     current exchange rates.

     Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
     represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
     currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
     between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually
     received. Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
     rates on investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from
     the effects of changes in the market price of those securities but are
     included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

D.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

     The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
     the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
     future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
     exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation
     are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records
     realized gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by entry into a
     closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may
     arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of
     counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated
     movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.
     During the six months ended May 31, 2017, the Trust did not enter into any
     forward foreign currency contracts.

E.   Federal Income Taxes

     It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
     all of its net taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to
     its shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. As
     of November 30, 2016, the Trust did not accrue any interest or penalties
     with respect to uncertain tax positions, which if applicable, would be
     recorded as an income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. Tax
     returns filed within the prior three years remain subject to examination by
     federal and state tax authorities.

     The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
     shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
     which may differ from U.S. GAAP. Distributions in excess of net investment
     income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions for financial
     statement and tax purposes. Capital accounts within the financial
     statements are adjusted for permanent book/tax differences to reflect tax
     character, but are not adjusted for temporary differences.

     The tax character of current year distributions payable to shareowners will
     be determined at the end of the current taxable year.

     The tax character of distributions paid to shareowners during the year
     ended November 30, 2016 was as follows:

     ===========================================================================
</TABLE>

     The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
     primarily attributable to the realization for tax purposes of unrealized
     gains on investments in passive foreign investment companies, the book/tax
     differences in the accrual of income on securities in default, the
     difference between book and tax amortization methods and discounts on fixed
     income securities.

F.   Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS)

     The Trust invests in event-linked bonds. Event-linked bonds are floating
     rate debt obligations for which the return of principal and the payment of
     interest are contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger"
     event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. The
     trigger event's magnitude may be based on losses to a company or industry,
     industry indexes or readings of scientific instruments, or may be based on
     specified actual losses. If a trigger event occurs, as defined within the
     terms of an event-linked bond, the Trust may lose a portion or all of its
     accrued interest and/or principal invested in such event-linked bond. The
     Trust is entitled to receive principal and interest payments so long as no
     trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude specified by the
     instrument. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked bonds
     may expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
     (credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
     adverse tax consequences.

     The Trust's investments in ILS may include special purpose vehicles
     ("SPVs") or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a
     reinsurer's catastrophe-oriented business, known as quota share instruments
     (sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars), or to provide reinsurance
     relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a
     collateralized instrument, known as collateralized reinsurance. Structured
     reinsurance investments also may include industry loss warranties ("ILWs").
     A traditional ILW takes the form of a bilateral reinsurance contract, but
     there are also products that take the form of derivatives, collateralized
     structures, or exchange traded instruments.

56 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17
<PAGE>

     Structured reinsurance investments, including quota share instruments,
     collateralized reinsurance investments and ILWs, generally are subject to
     the same risks as event-linked bonds. In addition, where the instruments
     are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance contracts, the Trust
     has limited transparency into the individual underlying contracts and
     therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and sound underwriting
     practices of the issuer. Accordingly, it may be more difficult for Amundi
     Pioneer's, formerly PIM, to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of
     the Trust's structured reinsurance investments and therefore the Trust's
     assets are placed at greater risk of loss than if Amundi Pioneer's,
     formerly PIM, had more complete information. Structured reinsurance
     instruments generally will be considered illiquid securities by the Trust.
     These securities may be difficult to purchase, sell or unwind. Illiquid
     securities also may be difficult to value. If the Trust is forced to sell
     an illiquid asset, the Trust may be forced to sell at a loss.

G.   Risks

     Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the
     Trust's original offering prospectus, with additional information included
     in the Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to
     those documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the
     Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are
     interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any
     economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting
     those industries and sectors.

     The value of securities held by the Trust may go up or down, sometimes
     rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real or
     perceived adverse economic, political or regulatory conditions, inflation,
     changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse
     investor sentiment. In the past several years, financial markets have
     experienced increased volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity
     and heightened uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen or
     spread.

     The Trust invests in below investment grade (high yield) debt securities,
     floating rate loans and event-linked bonds sometimes referred to as
     "catastrophe" bonds or "insurance-linked" bonds. The Trust may invest in
     securities and other obligations of any credit quality, including those
     that are rated below investment grade, or are unrated but are determined by
     the investment adviser to be of equivalent credit quality. Below investment
     grade securities are commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are
     considered speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay
     interest and repay principal. Below investment grade securities, including
     floating rate loans, involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater
     price volatility, and are less

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17 57
<PAGE>

     liquid and more difficult to value, especially during periods of economic
     uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt securities. Certain
     securities in which the Trust invests, including floating rate loans, once
     sold, may not settle for an extended period (for example, several weeks or
     even longer). The Trust will not receive its sale proceeds until that time,
     which may constrain the Trust's ability to meet its obligations. The Trust
     may invest in securities of issuers that are in default or that are in
     bankruptcy. The value of collateral, if any, securing a floating rate loan
     can decline or may be insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations or may
     be difficult to liquidate. No active trading market may exist for many
     floating rate loans, and many loans are subject to restrictions on resale.
     Any secondary market may be subject to irregular trading activity and
     extended settlement periods. The Trust's investments in certain foreign
     markets or countries with limited developing markets may subject the Trust
     to a greater degree of risk than in a developed market. These risks include
     disruptive political or economic conditions and the possible imposition of
     adverse governmental laws or currency exchange restrictions.

     Interest rates in the U.S. recently have been historically low, so the
     Trust faces a heightened risk that interest rates may rise. A general rise
     in interest rates may cause investors to move out of fixed income
     securities on a large scale, which could adversely affect the price and
     liquidity of fixed income securities.

H.   Repurchase Agreements

     Repurchase agreements are arrangements under which the Trust purchases
     securities from a broker-dealer or a bank, called the counterparty, upon
     the agreement of the counterparty to repurchase the securities from the
     Trust at a later date, and at a specific price, which is typically higher
     than the purchase price paid by the Trust. The securities purchased serve
     as the Trust's collateral for the obligation of the counterparty to
     repurchase the securities. The value of the collateral, including accrued
     interest, is required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price.
     The collateral for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the
     customer-only account of the Trust's custodian or a subcustodian of the
     Trust. Amundi Pioneer's formerly, PIM, is responsible for determining that
     the value of the collateral remains at least equal to the repurchase price.
     In the event of a default by the counterparty, the Trust is entitled to
     sell the securities, but the Trust may not be able to sell them for the
     price at which they were purchased, thus causing a loss to the Trust.
     Additionally, if the counterparty becomes insolvent, there is some risk
     that the Trust will not have a right to the securities, or the immediate
     right to sell the securities. Open repurchase agreements as of May 31, 2017
     are disclosed in the Trust's Schedule of Investments.

I.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
     automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
     Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
     distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional shares of
     the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
     Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
     capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely
     voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by
     notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for
     shareowners in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to
     any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be
     effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other
     distribution.

     If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
     other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
     the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
     the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A
     firm or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in shares of the
     Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

     Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on shares payable in cash,
     participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares acquired by
     the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
     authorized shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares
     on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for
     any dividend, the net asset value per share is equal to or less than the
     market price per share plus estimated brokerage trading fees (market
     premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
     shares. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to each account
     will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net
     asset value per share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the
     maximum discount from the then current market price per share on the date
     of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend,
     the net asset value per share is greater than the market value (market
     discount), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares
     acquired in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges with
     respect to newly issued shares. However, each participant will pay a pro
     rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan
     Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve
     shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be due on
     dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a
     brokerage account may be able to transfer the shares to another broker and
     continue to participate in the Plan.

J.   Credit Default Swap Agreements

     A credit default swap is a contract between a buyer of protection and a
     seller of protection against a pre-defined credit event on an underlying
     reference obligation, which may be a single security or a basket or index
     of securities. The Trust may buy or sell credit default swap agreements to
     seek to increase the Trust's income, or to attempt to hedge the risk of
     default on portfolio securities. A credit default swap index is used to
     hedge risk or take a position on a basket of credit entities or indices. As
     a seller of protection, the Trust would be required to pay the notional (or
     other agreed-upon) value of the referenced debt obligation to the
     counterparty in the event of a default by a U.S. or foreign corporate
     issuer of a debt obligation, which would likely result in a loss to the
     Trust. In return, the Trust would receive from the counterparty a periodic
     stream of payments during the term of the contract provided that no event
     of default occurred. The maximum exposure of loss to the seller would be
     the notional value of the credit default swaps outstanding. If no default
     occurs, the Trust would keep the stream of payments and would have no
     payment obligation. The Trust may also buy credit default swap agreements
     in order to hedge against the risk of default of debt securities, in which
     case the Trust would function as the counterparty referenced above.

     When the Trust enters into a credit default swap agreements, the protection
     buyer makes an upfront or periodic payment to the protection seller in
     exchange for the right to receive a contingent payment. An upfront payment
     made by the Trust, as the protection buyer, is recorded as an asset in the
     Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Periodic payments received or paid by
     the Trust are recorded as realized gains or losses in the Statement of
     Operations.

     Credit default swap agreements are marked-to-market daily using valuations
     supplied by independent sources and the change in value, if any, is
     recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of
     Assets and Liabilities. Payments received or made as a result of a credit
     event or upon termination of the contract are recognized, net of the
     appropriate amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses in
     the Statement of Operations.

     Credit default swap agreements involving the sale of protection may involve
     greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the referenced debt
     instrument directly. Credit default swap agreements are subject to general
     market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the
     Trust is a protection buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its
     investment. If the Trust is a protection seller and a credit event occurs,
     the value of the referenced debt

60 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17
<PAGE>

     instrument received by the Trust, together with the periodic payments
     received, may be less than the amount the Trust pays to the protection
     buyer, resulting in a loss to the Trust.

     Certain swap agreements that are cleared through a central clearinghouse
     are referred to as centrally cleared swaps. All payments made or received
     by the Trust are pursuant to a centrally cleared swap agreement with the
     central clearing party rather than the original counterparty. Upon entering
     into a centrally cleared swap agreement, the Trust is required to make an
     initial margin deposit, either in cash or in securities. The daily change
     in value on open centrally cleared swap agreements is recorded as variation
     margin on centrally cleared swaps on the Statement of Assets and
     Liabilities.

     The amount of cash deposited with the broker as collateral at May 31, 2017,
     and is included in "Restricted cash" in the Statement of Assets and
     Liabilities, was $200,181.

     Open credit default swap agreements at May 31, 2017 are listed in the
     Schedule of Investments. The average market value of credit default swap
     agreements open during the six months ended May 31, 2017 was $167,418.

2. Management Agreement

Amundi Pioneer, formerly PIM, manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees
payable under the Trust's Advisory Agreement with Amundi Pioneer, formerly PIM,
are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total assets of the Trust,
including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all accrued liabilities
incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall not include any
liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage obtained through
(i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation, borrowing through a
credit facility or the issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance of
preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or (iii) any other
means. For the six months ended May 31, 2017 the net management fee was 0.70%
(annualized) of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent
to 1.02% (annualized) of the Trust's average daily net assets.

In addition, under Amundi Pioneer, formerly PIM's, management and administration
agreements, certain other services and costs are paid by Amundi Pioneer,
formerly PIM, and reimbursed by the Trust. At May 31, 2017, $372,886 was payable
to Amundi Pioneer, formerly PIM, related to management costs, administrative
costs and certain other services is included in "Due to affiliates" and
"Administration fee" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

3. Transfer Agent

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (AST) serves as the transfer agent
with respect to the Trust's shares. The Trust pays AST an annual fee, as is
agreed to from time to time by the Trust and AST, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimbursed the transfer agent for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the transfer agent related to shareowner communications activities
such as proxy and statement mailings and outgoing calls.

4.   Additional Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Trust's use of derivatives subjects it to the following risks:

Interest rate risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of interest-bearing
securities due to changes in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.

Credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer of a financial instrument to
make further principal or interest payments on an obligation or commitment that
it has to the Trust.

Foreign exchange rate risk relates to fluctuations in the value of an asset or
liability due to changes in currency exchange rates.

Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as
a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest
rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether caused by factors specific to an
individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all instruments
traded in a market or market segment.

Commodity risk relates to the risk that the value of a commodity or commodity

7. Credit Agreement

Effective November 26, 2013, the Trust entered into a revolving credit facility
(the Credit Agreement) with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of
$160,000,000. The Credit Agreement was established in conjunction with the
redemption of all the Trust's auction market preferred shares. Effective
November 23, 2016, the Trust extended the maturity of the Credit Agreement to
November 22, 2019.

At May 31, 2017, the Trust had a borrowing outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaling $143,450,000. The interest rate charged at May 31, 2017 was
2.05%. During the six months ended May 31, 2017, the average daily balance was
$143,450,000 at an average interest rate of 1.84%. Interest expense of
$1,313,073 in connection with the Credit Agreement is included in the Statement
of Operations.

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Asset coverage is calculated by
subtracting the Trust's total liabilities not including any bank loans and
senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such amount by the
principal amount of the borrowing outstanding.

8. Subsequent Events

A monthly dividend was declared on June 2, 2017 from undistributed and

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Prior to July 3, 2017 Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (the "Adviser"), the
Trust's investment adviser, was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
UniCredit S.p.A. ("UniCredit"). On that date, UniCredit completed the sale of
its Pioneer Investments business, which includes the Adviser, to Amundi (the
"Transaction"). As a result of the Transaction, the Adviser became an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of Amundi. Amundi is controlled by Credit Agricole S.A.
Amundi is headquartered in Paris, France, and, as of September 30, 2016, had
more than $1.1 trillion in assets under management worldwide.

Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T"), the Trust's previous independent registered
public accounting firm, informed the Audit Committee and the Board that it would
no longer be independent with respect to the Trust upon the completion of the
Transaction as a result of certain services being provided to Amundi and Credit
Agricole, and, accordingly, that it intended to resign as the Trust's
independent registered public accounting firm upon the completion of the
Transaction. D&T's resignation was effective on July 3, 2017, when the
Transaction was completed.

During the periods as to which D&T has served as the Trust's independent
registered public accounting firm, including the Trust's two most recent fiscal
years preceding the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, D&T's reports on the
Trust's financial statements have not contained an adverse opinion or disclaimer
of opinion and have not been qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit
scope or accounting principles. Further, there have been no disagreements with
D&T on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of D&T, would have caused D&T to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement in connection with its report on the financial
statements. In addition, there have been no reportable events of the kind
described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

Effective immediately following the completion of the Transaction on July 3,
2017, the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, engaged
a new independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"),
for the Trust's fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17 65
<PAGE>

Prior to its engagement, EY had advised the Trust's Audit Committee that EY had
identified the following matters, in each case relating to services rendered by
other member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, all of which are located
outside the United States, to UniCredit and certain of its subsidiaries during
the period commencing July 1, 2016, that it determined to be inconsistent with
the auditor independence rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"): (a) project management support services to UniCredit in the
Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Serbia and Slovenia in relation to twenty-two
projects, that were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(vi) of
Regulation S-X (management functions); (b) two engagements for UniCredit in
Italy where fees were contingent/success based and that were determined to be
inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(5) of Regulation S-X (contingent fees); (c) four
engagements where legal and expert services were provided to UniCredit in the
Czech Republic and Germany, and twenty engagements where the legal advisory
services were provided to UniCredit in Austria, Czech Republic, Italy and
Poland, that were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(ix) and (x)
of Regulation S-X (legal and expert services); and (d) two engagements for
UniCredit in Italy involving assistance in the sale of certain assets, that were
determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(viii) of Regulation S-X
(broker-dealer, investment advisor or investment banking services). None of the
foregoing services involved the Trust, any of the other funds in the Pioneer
Family of Funds or any other Pioneer entity sold by UniCredit in the
Transaction.

EY advised the Audit Committee that it had considered the matters described
above and had concluded that such matters would not impair EY's ability to
exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the
financial statements of the Trust under the SEC and Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board independence rules, and that a reasonable investor with
knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same
conclusion. Management and the Audit Committee considered these matters and
discussed the matters with EY and, based upon EY's description of the matters
and statements made by EY, Management and the Audit Committee believe that EY
will be capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in connection
with the audits of the financial statements of the Trust, and Management further
believes that a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and
circumstances would reach the same conclusion.

Approval of New and Interim Management Agreements

Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc. (Amundi Pioneer), formerly Pioneer
Investment Management, Inc., serves as the investment adviser to Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) pursuant to an investment management agreement
between Amundi Pioneer and the Trust.

On July 3, 2017, Amundi acquired Pioneer Investments, a group of asset
management companies located throughout the world (the "Transaction"). As a
result of the Transaction, Amundi Pioneer became an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Amundi and Amundi's wholly-owned subsidiary, Amundi USA, Inc.
Prior to July 3, 2017, Pioneer Investments was owned by Pioneer Global Asset
Management S.p.A. ("PGAM"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A.
("UniCredit").

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Trust's current investment
management agreement (the "Current Management Agreement") terminated
automatically upon the consummation of the Transaction. In order for Amundi
Pioneer to continue to manage the Trust after the consummation of the
Transaction, the Trustees and shareholders of the Trust were required to approve
a new investment management agreement for the Trust (the "New Management
Agreement"). As discussed below, the Board of Trustees of the Trust approved the
New Management Agreement at a meeting held on March 6-7, 2017. The New
Management Agreement was approved by the shareholders of the Trust at a meeting
held on June 13, 2017. The Board of Trustees of the Trust also approved an
interim investment management agreement between Amundi Pioneer and the Trust
(the "Interim Management Agreement") at the March 6-7, 2017 meeting. The Interim
Management Agreement would have taken effect upon the closing of the Transaction
in the event that the shareholders of the Trust did not approve the New
Management Agreement.

Board Evaluation of the New and Interim Management Agreements

The Board evaluated the Transaction and the New Management Agreement and Interim
Management Agreement for the Trust. In connection with their evaluation of the
Transaction and the New Management Agreement for the Trust, the Trustees
requested such information as they deemed reasonably necessary, including: (a)
the structure of the Transaction and the strategy underlying the Transaction;
(b) the anticipated benefits of the Transaction to the Trust and its
shareholders; (c) the post-Transaction plans for Amundi Pioneer, including
Amundi's plans for integration of Pioneer Investments and Amundi Pioneer with
its existing asset management businesses and plans for the future development of
Amundi Pioneer; (d) the effect of the Transaction on the ongoing services
provided to the Trust, including the need to select a new independent registered
public accounting firm for the Trust, and any

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17 67
<PAGE>

plans to modify the operations of the Trust; (e) the stability and continuity of
Amundi Pioneer's management and key employees, including compensation and
benefits to Amundi Pioneer's key employees, and retention plans and incentive
plan structure; (f) the post-Transaction indebtedness and financial resources of
Amundi Pioneer; (g) Amundi's legal and operational structure, its principal
shareholders and senior management, its investment management, risk management,
administrative, legal and compliance functions; (h) certain regulatory matters
relating to Amundi's affiliates; and (i) Amundi's commitment to the United
States, including the role of Amundi Pioneer in the larger Amundi business.

The Trustees also requested and obtained the following information in connection
with their evaluation of the Transaction and the New Management Agreement for
the Trust: (i) memoranda provided by Fund counsel that summarized the legal
standards and other considerations that are relevant to the Trustees in their
deliberations regarding the New Management Agreement; (ii) the qualifications of
the investment management teams for the Trust, as well as the level of
investment by the Trust's portfolio managers in the Trust; (iii) the Trust's
management fees and total expense ratios, the financial statements of Amundi
Pioneer and its pre- and post-Transaction parent companies, profitability
analyses from Amundi Pioneer, and analyses from Amundi Pioneer as to possible
economies of scale; (iv) the profitability of the institutional business of
Amundi Pioneer and Amundi Pioneer's affiliate, Pioneer Institutional Asset
Management, Inc. ("PIAM") as compared to that of Amundi Pioneer's fund
management business; and (v) the differences between the fees and expenses of
the Trust and the fees and expenses of Amundi Pioneer's and PIAM's institutional
accounts, as well as the different services provided by Adviser to the Trust and
by Amundi Pioneer and PIAM to the institutional accounts. In addition, the
Trustees considered the information provided at regularly scheduled meetings
throughout the year regarding the Trust's performance and risk attributes,
including through meetings with investment management personnel, and took into
account other information related to the Trust provided to the Trustees at
regularly scheduled meetings. The Trustees also considered information they had
received in their review of the continuance of the Current Management Agreement
for the Trust in September 2016.

At meetings held on January 9, 2017 and January 10, 2017, the Trustees met with
representatives of Amundi and PGAM, including separate meetings of the Trustees
who are not "interested persons" of the Fund Complex ("Independent Trustees")
and counsel with representatives of Amundi and PGAM, and subsequently with
representatives of Amundi. In those meetings, they received an extensive
presentation from the representatives of Amundi, including the chief executive
officer of Amundi, describing Amundi's background and history, its global asset
management activities, the growth of

68 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17
<PAGE>

its business, and its status as the largest asset management firm in Europe and
one of the largest globally; its capital structure and financial resources,
including information as to the financing of the Transaction; its principal
investors, including its majority investor Credit Agricole S.A., and Credit
Agricole's long-term commitment to the asset management business; the philosophy
and strategy underlying the Transaction and the complementarity of Amundi's and
Pioneer Investments' respective asset management businesses; Amundi's various
operating and investment committees and how they would likely interact with
Amundi Pioneer; the proposed integration process, including the progress to date
and the establishment of various integration work streams; Amundi's plans for
management of Amundi Pioneer; Amundi's philosophy as to compensation of key
employees and its general intentions with respect to incentive plans for key
employees of Amundi Pioneer; Amundi's preliminary plans to achieve cost and
other synergies; and opportunities to further develop the business of Amundi
Pioneer and PIAM, including in the area of institutional asset management, and
how that would benefit shareholders of the Pioneer Funds.

In those meetings, the representatives of Amundi confirmed their intention that
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Amundi Pioneer would
remain in their current positions, and confirmed that they do not currently
foresee major changes in the day-to-day investment management operations of
Amundi Pioneer with respect to the Trust as a direct result of the Transaction.
They discussed incentive arrangements for key personnel that would continue
after the closing of the Transaction and their plans to establish a new
long-term incentive plan following the closing. They also generally discussed
ways in which Amundi Pioneer could potentially draw on the expanded global
resources of Amundi post-Transaction. At those meetings, the Independent
Trustees identified certain areas to which they requested further information,
including as to trading and execution of securities transactions, research and
portfolio management and potential changes in investment process, particularly
where asset classes managed by Amundi Pioneer would overlap with asset classes
managed by Amundi, the continued availability of resources currently at Pioneer
Investments or elsewhere within Amundi to assist in management of certain Funds,
and any anticipated significant changes in operations. The Independent Trustees
considered the uncertainty as to whether the Trust's independent registered
public accounting firm could continue to act in that capacity after the closing
of the Transaction. The Independent Trustees also met with counsel to review the
information they had received to date and to discuss next steps.

Subsequently, the Trustees received further information from Amundi, including
written responses to questions raised by the Independent Trustees, and received
from Amundi Pioneer the information requested of it. The Independent Trustees
reviewed the information provided with counsel at

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17 69
<PAGE>

telephonic meetings held on February 16, 2017 and February 27, 2017. The
Trustees held a special in-person Board meeting on March 6-7, 2017 for further
consideration of the New Management Agreements, the Interim Management
Agreements and the Transaction. The Trustees met again with senior executives of
Amundi at the March 6-7, 2017 meeting.

At the March 6-7, 2017 meeting, based on their evaluation of the information
provided by Amundi Pioneer and Amundi, the Trustees including the Independent
Trustees voting separately, approved the New Management Agreement and the
Interim Management Agreement for the Trust. In considering the New Management
Agreement for the Trust, the Trustees considered various factors that they
determined were relevant, including the factors described below. The Trustees
did not identify any single factor as the controlling factor in their
determinations. The Trustees considered the same factors with respect to the
Interim Management Agreement for the Trust.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services

The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services that had
been provided by Amundi Pioneer to the Trust and that are expected to be
provided by Amundi Pioneer to the Trust following the consummation of the
Transaction. The Trustees reviewed the terms of the New Management Agreement,
and noted that such terms are substantially similar to the terms of the Current
Management Agreement, except for different execution dates, effective dates and
termination dates. The Trustees reviewed Amundi Pioneer's investment approach
for the Trust and its research process. The Trustees considered the resources of
Amundi Pioneer and the personnel of Amundi Pioneer who provide investment
management services to the Trust. They also reviewed the amount of
non-investment resources and personnel of Amundi Pioneer that are involved in
Amundi Pioneer's services to the Trust, including Amundi Pioneer's compliance
and legal resources and personnel. The Trustees noted the substantial attention
and high priority given by Amundi Pioneer's senior management to the Pioneer
Fund complex.

The Trustees considered that Amundi Pioneer supervises and monitors the
performance of the Trust's service providers and provides the Trust with
personnel (including Fund officers) and other resources that are necessary for
the Trust's business management and operations and that Amundi Pioneer would
continue to provide those investment management and research services and
resources to the Trust following the consummation of the Transaction. The
Trustees also considered that, as administrator, Amundi Pioneer would continue
to be responsible for the administration of the Trust's business and other
affairs. The Trustees considered the fees to be paid to Amundi Pioneer for the
provision of administration services.

70 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17
<PAGE>

The Trustees considered that Deloitte & Touche LLP informed the Board that it
would no longer be independent with respect to the Trust upon the completion of
the Transaction and, accordingly, that it would be necessary for the Board to
engage a new independent registered public accounting firm for the Trust.

The Trustees considered that the Transaction was not expected to have a material
adverse impact on the nature, scope and overall quality of services provided to
the Trust and its shareholders, including investment management, risk
management, administrative, compliance, legal and other services, as a result of
the Transaction.

In that regard, the Trustees considered that Amundi is one of the largest asset
managers globally, and that Amundi Pioneer may have access to additional
research and portfolio management capabilities as a result of the Transaction
and that Amundi Pioneer, as part of Amundi, is expected to have an enhanced
global presence that may contribute to an increase in the overall scale and
resources of Amundi Pioneer. Furthermore, in considering whether the Transaction
would be expected to have a material adverse impact on the nature, scope and
overall quality of services provided to the Trust and its shareholders, the
Trustees considered the statements by representatives of Amundi that they expect
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Amundi Pioneer to
remain in their current positions and that they do not currently foresee major
changes in the day-to-day investment management operations of Amundi Pioneer as
a direct result of the Transaction, or the risk management, legal or compliance
services provided by Amundi Pioneer, with respect to the Trust. They further
considered the current incentive arrangements for key personnel of Amundi
Pioneer that would continue after the closing of the Transaction. They also
noted Amundi's stated intention to establish a new long-term incentive plan
following the closing.

The Trustees also took into account their experience in evaluating the proposed
combination of Pioneer Investments and Santander Asset Management, which was
announced in September, 2014 and abandoned in July, 2016. In light of, among
other things, this experience, the Trustees determined that they were not able
to identify any realistic alternatives to approving the New Management Agreement
that would provide the level of services to the Trust and its shareholders that
are expected to be provided by Amundi Pioneer after the closing of the
Transaction.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services that Amundi Pioneer would continue to provide to the
Trust under the New Management Agreement would be satisfactory and consistent
with the terms of the New Management Agreement.

Performance of the Trust

In considering the Trust's performance, the Trustees regularly reviewed and
discussed throughout the year data prepared by Amundi Pioneer and information
comparing the Trust's performance with the performance of its peer group of
funds, as classified by each of Morningstar, Inc. (Morningstar) and Lipper, and
the performance of the Trust's benchmark index. They also discussed the Trust's
performance with Amundi Pioneer on a regular basis.

The Trustees' regular reviews and discussions were factored into the Trustees'
deliberations concerning the approval of the New Management Agreement.

Management Fee and Expenses

The Trustees noted that the stated management fees to be paid by the Trust are
identical under the Current Management Agreement and the New Management
Agreement. The Trustees considered information showing the fees and expenses of
the Trust in comparison to the management fees and expense ratios of its peer
group of funds as classified by Morningstar and also to the expense ratios of a
peer group of funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the
Independent Trustees for this purpose using data provided by Strategic Insight
Mutual Fund Research and Consulting, LLC (Strategic Insight), an independent
third party. In all quintile rankings referred to below, first quintile is most
favorable to the Trust's shareowners. To the extent applicable, the Trustees
also considered the impact of transfer agency, sub-transfer agency, and other
non-management fee expenses on the expense ratios of the Trust. The Trustees
noted that they separately review the Trust's transfer agency, sub-transfer
agency and intermediary arrangements and that the results of the most recent
such review were considered in the consideration of the Trust's expense ratio.

The Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee (based on managed
assets) as of September 30, 2016 was in the first quintile relative to the
management fees paid by other funds in its Strategic Insight peer group for the
comparable period. The Trustees considered that the expense ratio (based on
managed assets) of the Trust's common shares as of September 30, 2016 was in the
first quintile relative to its Strategic Insight peer group for the comparable
period.

The Trustees reviewed management fees charged by Amundi Pioneer and PIAM to
institutional and other clients, including publicly offered European funds
sponsored by Amundi Pioneer's affiliates, unaffiliated U.S. registered
investment companies (in a sub-advisory capacity), and unaffiliated foreign and
domestic separate accounts. The Trustees also considered Amundi Pioneer's costs
in providing services to the Trust and Amundi Pioneer's and PIAM's costs in
providing services to the other clients and considered the

72 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/17
<PAGE>

differences in management fees and profit margins for fund and non-fund
services. In evaluating the fees associated with Amundi Pioneer's and PIAM's
client accounts, the Trustees took into account the respective demands,
resources and complexity associated with the Trust and other client accounts.
The Trustees noted that in some instances the fee rates for those clients were
lower than the management fee for the Trust and considered that, under both the
Current Management Agreement and the New Management Agreement, Amundi Pioneer
would perform additional services for the Trust that it does not provide to
those other clients or services that are broader in scope, including oversight
of the Trust's other service providers and activities related to compliance and
the extensive regulatory and tax regimes to which the Trust is subject. The
Trustees also considered the different risks associated with Amundi Pioneer's
management of the Trust and Amundi Pioneer's and PIAM's management of the other
client accounts.

The Trustees concluded that the management fee payable by the Trust to Amundi
Pioneer was reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services to
be provided by Amundi Pioneer.

Profitability

The Trustees considered information provided by Amundi Pioneer regarding the
profitability of Amundi Pioneer with respect to the advisory services provided
by Amundi Pioneer to the Trust, including the methodology used by Amundi Pioneer
in allocating certain of its costs to the management of the Trust. The Trustees
also considered Amundi Pioneer's profit margin in connection with the overall
operation of the Trust. They further reviewed the financial results, including
the profit margins, realized by Amundi Pioneer and PIAM from non-fund
businesses. The Trustees considered Amundi Pioneer's profit margins with respect
to the Trust in comparison to the limited industry data available and noted that
the profitability of any adviser was affected by numerous factors, including its
organizational structure and method for allocating expenses. The Trustees
concluded that Amundi Pioneer's profitability with respect to the management of
the Trust was not unreasonable.

Economies of Scale

The Trustees considered Amundi Pioneer's views relating to economies of scale in
connection with the Pioneer Funds as fund assets grow and the extent to which
any such economies of scale are shared with the Trust and Fund shareholders. The
Trustees recognize that economies of scale are difficult to identify and
quantify, and that, among other factors that may be relevant, are the following:
fee levels, expense subsidization, investment by Amundi Pioneer in research and
analytical capabilities and Amundi Pioneer's commitment and resource allocation
to the Trust. The Trustees noted that profitability also may

<PAGE>

be an indicator of the availability of any economies of scale, although
profitability may vary for other reasons including due to reductions in
expenses. The Trustees concluded that economies of scale, if any, were being
appropriately shared with the Trust.

Other Benefits

The Trustees considered the other benefits that Amundi Pioneer enjoys from its
relationship with the Trust. The Trustees considered the character and amount of
fees paid or to be paid by the Trust, other than under the Current Management
Agreement or the New Management Agreement, for services provided by Amundi
Pioneer and its affiliates. The Trustees further considered the revenues and
profitability of Amundi Pioneer's businesses other than the Fund business. To
the extent applicable, the Trustees also considered the benefits to the Trust
and to Amundi Pioneer and its affiliates from the use of "soft" commission
dollars generated by the Trust to pay for research and brokerage services.

The Trustees considered that following the completion of the Transaction, Amundi
Pioneer will be the principal U.S. asset management business of Amundi, and that
Amundi's worldwide asset management business will manage over $1.38 trillion in
assets (including the Pioneer Funds). This may create opportunities for Amundi
Pioneer, PIAM and Amundi that derive from Amundi Pioneer's relationships with
the Trust, including Amundi's ability to market the services of Amundi Pioneer
globally. The Trustees noted that Amundi Pioneer may have access to additional
research capabilities as a result of the Transaction and Amundi's enhanced
global presence that may contribute to an increase of the overall scale of
Amundi Pioneer. The Trustees considered that Amundi Pioneer and the Trust are
expected to receive reciprocal intangible benefits from the relationship,
including mutual brand recognition and, for the Trust, direct and indirect
access to the resources of a large global asset manager. The Trustees concluded
that any such benefits received by Amundi Pioneer as a result of its
relationship with the Trust were reasonable.

Conclusion

After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors, the
Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, concluded that the New Management
Agreement and the Interim Management Agreement for the Trust, including the fees
payable thereunder, were fair and reasonable and voted to approve the New
Management Agreement and the Interim Management Agreement, and to recommend that
shareholders approve the New Management Agreement.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

   Fund Distributor, Inc. overlap or conflict with the provisions of the this
   Code, they are superseded by this Code.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

   A Senior Officer's responsibilities under this Code are limited to Fund
   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,
   matters in which the Senior Officer routinely participates, and matters with
   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
   Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
