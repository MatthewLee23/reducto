                  Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and/or Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four
Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor") and their respective representatives, taking into
account the information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements
include all statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact.
For example, forward-looking statements include the use of words such as
"anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may,"
"should," "would" or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or
outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the
information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the
Advisor and/or Four Corners and their respective representatives only as of the
date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these
forward-looking statements to reflect events and circumstances that arise after
the date hereof.

                         Performance and Risk Disclosure

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of certain other risks of investing in the
Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                             How to Read This Report

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of Four
Corners are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be

       First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (FCT)
                                  Annual Report
                                  May 31, 2009


Dear Shareholders:

2008 brought all sorts of challenges to investors. Throughout the year, the
financial sector was plagued with failures in banking, insurance and brokerage
firms. By year's end, after a meltdown in the credit markets, historically high
levels of volatility in the stock market, and the resulting turmoil to the
overall economy, the Dow Jones Industrial Average's total return was -31.92% (as
of 12/31/08). In fact, 2008 was the Dow's third worst calendar year since its
inception in 1896. For the year, the negative total return performance of the
Dow was surpassed only by 1931 and 1907, two years in which the U.S. was also
enduring a major banking crisis. Of the thirty stocks in the Dow, only two were
up in 2008. However, many economists believe the recession that began in
December, 2007 ended in March, 2009. In fact, the Dow's total return from March
9 (the statistical end of the bear market) to May 31, 2009, was 30.83%. Of
course, no one can predict that this trend will continue.

Yet, regardless of the market, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") has
always believed that in order to be successful in reaching your financial goals,
you should be invested for the long term. A long-term investor understands that
the market, from a historical perspective, has always experienced ups and downs.
But history has shown that the patient investor is typically rewarded over the
long term. While no one has the ability to predict when the markets will
recover, we believe that staying invested in quality products and having a
long-term perspective can help investors reach their financial goals.

The report you hold contains detailed information about your investment in First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"). It contains
a portfolio commentary from the Fund's portfolio management team that provides a
market recap for the period, a performance analysis and a market and Fund
outlook. Additionally, the report provides the Fund's financial statements for
the period covered by the report. I encourage you to read this document and
discuss it with your financial advisor.

First Trust has been through many types of markets and remains committed to
bringing you quality investment solutions regardless of the inevitable ups and
downs experienced in the market. We offer a variety of products that may fit
many financial plans to help those investors seeking long-term investment
success. As well, we are committed to making available up-to-date information
about your investments so you and your financial advisor have current
information on your portfolio.

We continue to value our relationship with you, and we thank you for the
opportunity to assist you in achieving your financial goals.



Sincerely,


/s/ James A. Bowen

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II

The primary investment objective of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating
Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues its objectives by investing in a portfolio of Senior Loans. There
can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The
Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

Market Recap

The Fund's fiscal year ended May 31, 2009 included some of the most volatile
conditions in Senior Loan market history, including the Fund's worst and best
quarters since inception. The Fund's fiscal year can be divided into two
distinct and separate parts. In 2008, the Fund and the Senior Loan market were
under extreme stress. In the first five months of 2009, the Fund and the market
have rebounded significantly.


                                                                          Page 3

                 PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (Continued) (Unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2008's performance was dominated by the events surrounding the global financial
crisis and the collapse of Lehman Brothers. While the loan market had posted
weak returns in the first half of 2008 as the supply/demand imbalance, which has
existed in the market since mid-2007, continued to drive prices lower, the
collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 led to a global decline in many
asset prices, including loan prices. These price declines caused many loan
funds, which had invested in loans using leverage, to sell loans to satisfy
their leverage tests. This forced selling exacerbated the imbalance of an
already imbalanced market, and resulted in an S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index
("Index") return of a staggering -27.69% for the fourth quarter of 2008.

The technical imbalance which dominated the market in late 2007 and 2008
reversed itself in the first half of 2009. This reversal was caused by a number
of factors, including: increased prepayments of loans, inflows into loan and
high-yield mutual funds, no/limited forced selling/deleveraging, and some
optimism amidst so-called "green shoots," defined as any sign of growth or
recovery. We believe that the market was oversold in late 2008 and represented
very good relative value, so the fact that there has been a meaningful rebound
is not surprising to us given the extremely low prices which loans went to in
late 2008. However, we are surprised by the speed and severity of the rebound,
particularly since the rebound is occurring at a time when default rates are
reaching their highest levels ever(1), recovery rates are at historically low
levels(2), and fundamental economic conditions remain uncertain at best. Through
May 31, 2009, the Index was up 26.63% year-to-date, erasing most of the fourth
quarter 2008 losses that occurred post-Lehman Brothers' collapse.

With improved conditions and inflows in the loan and bond market, we have seen a
resumption of select new issue activity. In particular, we have seen a
significant amount of new-issue high-yield bond issuance, the proceeds of which
are being used to repay upcoming Senior Loan maturities. We think this is a
positive development given the meaningful amount of debt that matures in
upcoming years. If there was a functioning structured finance/Collaterized Loan
Obligation ("CLO") market to provide a source of funds for Senior Loan
maturities, we would have been less concerned about debt maturities 3-4 years
out. Given the low likelihood that CLOs will become a meaningful source of
demand for Senior Loans at any point in the foreseeable future, it is
encouraging to us to see other capital sources entering the market to provide
funds for needed refinancings.

There has been very little new issuance in the Senior Loan market given the
still high cost of capital. That being said, the few Senior Loan financings we
have seen recently have been conservatively structured loans on favorable
economic terms to investors. We expect this trend of investor-friendly issuance
to continue, albeit at a moderate pace, which we think is very positive for the
market in general and the Fund in particular.

Performance Analysis

The Fund generated a market value total return(3) of -26.11% (including market
price change and dividends) for the twelve months ended May 31, 2009. The Fund's
net asset value ("NAV") total return(4) was -22.07% over the same period. The
Fund's NAV return underperformed the Index return by -13.06% for the twelve
months ended May 31, 2009. The Fund's performance includes the negative impact
of leverage in a negative return environment as well as the negative impact of
fees, expenses, and un-invested cash balances (which are typically positive in a
down market) which are not part of the benchmark Index return. FCT's NAV return
exceeded the "pure-play" peer group average by 3.15% and the broad peer group
average by 5.87% for the twelve months ended May 31, 2009.(5) The Fund's closing
price on May 29, 2009 was $10.04, which represented a -14.77% discount to its
NAV, compared to the Fund's discount to NAV of -10.11% twelve months earlier on
May 31, 2008. It is important to note that the Fund has benefited from a strong
market in the first 5 months of 2009 and the Fund's NAV is up 46.22% from
January 1, 2009 through May 31, 2009 after a very difficult 2008.

The volatility of Senior Loans has increased dramatically in the last two years.
As the profile of the typical loan buyer has changed from a dedicated
asset-class buyer to a relative-value investor, we believe the asset class will
remain volatile in the foreseeable future. As a result of this volatility and
increased borrowing costs, we have reduced the Fund's leverage. While this could
cause Fund returns to lag in market rallies, we believe it to be the more
prudent course of action in the near term.

The Fund's income has declined primarily as a result of lower London Inter-Bank
Offer Rate ("LIBOR") rates, increased financing costs and a smaller asset base.
Distributions totalled $0.78 per Common Share during the twelve months ended May
31, 2009, which represented a 43.07% decrease from the prior twelve months ended
May 31, 2008. Based on the Fund's current dividend, FCT's distribution rate is
5.68% (calculated on the Fund's share price) and 4.83% (based on the Fund's NAV)
as of May 31, 2009. The twelve months ended May 31, 2009 dividends produced a
Fund yield (based on price) of 7.76%, which was lower than the pure-play peer
group average price yield of 8.89% and lower than the broad peer group average
price yield of 11.14%. The lower yield is in part due to differing levels of
leverage between funds, different asset composition, and importantly, a lesser
erosion of NAV at FCT than at many of its peers.

Market and Fund Outlook

We have seen a material increase in loan defaults in the past year and will
likely see the default rate continue to escalate as a result of a slowing U.S.
economy and the global financial crisis. Furthermore, because there has been a
fundamental change in the profile of the typical loan investor, we expect to see
continued loan volatility for the foreseeable future.

Notwithstanding the significant rally in the first half of 2009, we still find
Senior Loan investments attractive. Senior Loans often have the highest
collateral security in a company's capital structure and (in many instances) the
market trading price is below our expected recovery on the loan. While recovery
rates have declined recently and may not continue at average historical levels,
we believe that, at current prices/spreads, investors are being compensated for
this risk and have adequate cushion to absorb credit losses and still earn high
risk-adjusted returns.

It is our view that the Fund offers a high quality non-investment grade
portfolio focused almost exclusively on first-lien Senior Loans. As a result, we
expect the Fund's relative performance to be driven by relative returns among
risk asset categories. Specifically, the first three months of 2009 were
dominated by a flight to quality in the loan market, where higher rated loans
meaningfully outperformed lower rated loans. This was occurring against a
backdrop of the equity market reaching new lows. Therefore, the Fund performed
well on a relative and absolute basis during the period as a result of its
holding higher-rated assets than some of its peers. Conversely, April and May of
2009 were months where riskier assets in the loan market rallied more than
higher-rated assets, and we would expect to see this result in relative
underperformance versus funds that invest in lower-rated loans on average.

    Average recovery rates decreased to 48.41% at 3/31/09, below the long-term
    average recovery rate of 68.15%, and below the 51.17% low set in 1999.

3   Total return based on market value is the combination of reinvested dividend
    distributions and reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at prices
    obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and changes in Common Share
    Price.

4   Total return based on NAV is the combination of reinvested dividend
    distributions and reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at prices
    obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and changes in NAV per share and
    does not reflect sales load.

5   The "broad" peer group consists of 16 Senior Loan-based funds. Of the broad
    peer group, eleven of the 16 total funds invest a material portion of their
    assets in high-yield bonds, emerging markets debt or other types of
    corporate debt securities. The "pure-play" peer group consists of a smaller
    subset (FCM, FCT, PPR, TLI and VVR) of the broad peer group, which invests
    almost exclusively in Senior Loans. We believe that these "pure-play" funds
    are generally more comparable to the Fund than the broad peer group, as the
    non-Senior Loan holdings are routinely less than 5% of such funds.

       First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                               May 31, 2009


                           1. Fund Description

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                    2. Significant Accounting Policies

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. Portfolio Valuation:
The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. Domestic debt securities and foreign
securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal
markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is calculated by dividing
the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued interest), less all
liabilities (including accrued expenses, dividends declared but unpaid and any
borrowings of the Fund) and the liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred
Shares, by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio investments, at fair value according
to valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of
the Fund's assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties.
In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations
are deemed unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust
Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's
investments. Additionally, if events occur after the close of the principal
market for particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities),
but before the Fund values its assets, that could materially affect NAV, First
Trust may use a fair value method to value the Fund's investments. The use of
fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by valuation procedures adopted by
the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940
Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by a third party pricing service. If the pricing
service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior Loan or
such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior Loan at a
fair value according to valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio investments listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
investments are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Investments traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio investments traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as
of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such investments. Portfolio investments
traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding investments traded on the
NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature
in less than 60 days when purchased are valued at amortized cost.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements"
("FAS 157"), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. This
standard clarifies the definition of fair value for financial reporting,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional
disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FAS 157 became effective
for the Fund as of June 1, 2008, the beginning of its current fiscal year. The
three levels of the fair value hierarchy under FAS 157 are as follows:


                                                                         Page 23

       First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                               May 31, 2009


        o Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments
        o Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted
          prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds,
          credit risk, etc.)
        o Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risks associated with investing in those investments. A
summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of May 31, 2009 is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. Credit Default Swaps:

The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes or to
gain exposure to a credit in which the Fund may otherwise invest. A credit
default swap contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit
risk of an issuer. The Fund may be either the buyer or seller in a credit
default swap transaction. The "buyer" in a credit default swap contract is
obligated to pay the "seller" a periodic stream of payments over the term of the
contract provided that no event of default on the underlying reference
obligation has occurred. If an event of default occurs, the seller must pay the
buyer the full notional value, or "par value," of the reference obligation.
Credit default swap transactions are either "physical delivery" settled or
"cash" settled. Physical delivery entails the actual delivery of the reference
asset to the seller in exchange for payment of the full par value of the
reference asset. Cash settled entails a net cash payment from the seller to the
buyer based on the difference of the par value of the reference asset and the
current value of the reference asset that may have, through default, lost some,
most or all of its value. An event of default may be a grace period extension,
obligation acceleration, repudiation/moratorium, or restructuring.

Buying a credit default swap contract involves the risk that the contract may
expire worthless and the credit risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its
payment obligations to the Fund in the event of default. Selling a credit
default swap contract involves greater risks than if the Fund had invested in
the reference obligation directly. The Fund will segregate cash or liquid assets
in an amount equal to the aggregate market value of the credit default swap
contracts of which it is a seller. Additionally, the Fund maintains cash or
liquid assets for the full notional amount of the credit default swap contracts
of which it is a seller. The Fund may only enter into such transactions with
counterparties rated A- or higher.

Credit default swap contracts are marked to market daily based upon quotations
from brokers or market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation (depreciation). For a credit default swap contract sold
by the Fund, payment of the agreed-upon amount made by the Fund in the event of
default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as the cost of the
referenced debt obligation purchased/received. As of May 31, 2009, the Fund had
no outstanding credit default swaps.

C. Repurchase Agreements:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period.

This arrangement results in a fixed rate of return that is not subject to market
fluctuations during the Fund's holding period. The value of the collateral is at
all times at least equal to the total amount of the repurchase obligation,
including interest. In the event of counterparty default, the Fund has the right
to use the collateral to offset losses incurred. There is potential loss to the
Fund in the event the Fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to
dispose of the collateral investments, including the risk of a possible decline
in the value of the underlying investments during the period while the Fund
seeks to assert its rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the
creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into
repurchase agreements to evaluate potential risks. As of May 31, 2009, the Fund
had no open repurchase agreements.

D. Investment Transactions and Investment Income:

Investment transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from investment transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Investments purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such
investments is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund maintains liquid
assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued or
delayed-delivery purchase commitments. As of May 31, 2009, the Fund had no
when-issued or delayed-delivery purchase commitments.

E. Unfunded Loan Commitments:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
approximately $89,580 as of May 31, 2009. The Fund is obligated to fund these
loan commitments at the borrower's discretion. Net unrealized appreciation from
the commitments is $3,644 at May 31, 2009.

                               May 31, 2009


F. Restricted Investments:

The Fund invests in restricted investments, which are investments that cannot be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. Prior to registration, restricted investments may only be
resold in transactions exempt from registration. The Fund held restricted
investments at May 31, 2009 as shown in the following table. The Fund does not
have the right to demand that such investments be registered. These investments
are valued according to the valuation procedures as stated in the Portfolio
Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a discount to the carrying
value of a comparable unrestricted investment. There are no unrestricted
investments with the same maturity dates and yields for these issuers.

</TABLE>

(1) Investment was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on
    July 31, 2007.

G. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investments held by the
Fund, timing differences and differing characterizations of distributions made
by the Fund. Permanent differences incurred during the tax year ended May 31,
2009, resulting in book and tax accounting differences, have been reclassified
at year end to reflect an increase in undistributed net investment income by
$218,392 and a decrease in accumulated net realized gain (loss) on investments
sold by $218,392. Net assets applicable to Common Shareholders were not affected
by this reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2009 and May 31, 2008 are as follows:

Distributions paid from:                           2009           2008
                                                   ----           ----
Ordinary Income                             $   21,941,351    $  39,756,157

As of May 31, 2009, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income                $       373,047
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)   $  (101,071,467)
Accumulated Capital and other losses         $   (81,651,288)

H. Income Taxes:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes.

The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws, which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of loss and offset such loss against any future realized capital gains. At
May 31, 2009, the Fund had available realized capital losses of $3,984,460,
$3,611,723 and $25,697,677 to offset future net capital gains through the fiscal
years ended 2014, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

Post-October losses. Under current laws, certain losses realized after October
31 may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following
fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2009, the Fund intends to elect
to defer net realized losses incurred from November 1, 2008 through May 31, 2009
of $48,357,428.


                                                                         Page 25

       First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                               May 31, 2009


In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes." FIN 48 establishes a minimum threshold for
recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return, and is effective for the Fund's current
fiscal year. As of May 31, 2009, management has evaluated the application of FIN
48 to the Fund and has determined that no provision for income tax is required
in the Fund's financial statements.

I. Expenses:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

J. Accounting Pronouncement:

In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-4, "Determining Fair
Value when the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have
Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly" ("FSP
157-4"). FSP 157-4 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ending
after June 15, 2009. FSP 157-4 provides additional guidance for estimating fair
value in accordance with FAS 157, when the volume and level of activity for the
asset or liability have significantly decreased. FSP 157-4 also includes
guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not
orderly. Management is currently evaluating the impact the implementation of FSP
157-4 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures, if any.

 3. Investment Advisory Fee, Affiliated Transactions and Other Fee Arrangements

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage. L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, which are the average daily gross asset
value of the Fund (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP Shares,
and the principal amount of borrowings), minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and
unpaid dividends on any outstanding AMP Shares and accrued liabilities.

Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor")
serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

In accordance with certain fee arrangements, JPMorgan Investor Services Co.
served as the Fund's Administrator and Fund Accountant, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
National Association served as the Fund's Custodian and American Stock Transfer
& Trust Company served as the Fund's Transfer Agent. Effective May 25, 2009, PNC
Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. ("PNC"), an indirect, majority-owned
subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., serves as the Fund's
Transfer Agent in accordance with certain fee arrangements. Effective June 1,
2009, PNC also serves as the Fund's Administrator and Fund Accountant in
accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company, also an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., serves as
the Fund's Custodian as of June 1, 2009 in accordance with certain fee
arrangements. PNC continues to provide certain administrative services to the
Fund in connection with the Board's meetings and other related matters.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG ("Auction Agent"), serves as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar,
dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid an annual retainer
of $10,000 per trust for the first 14 trusts of the First Trust Fund Complex and
an annual retainer of $7,500 per trust for each subsequent trust added to the
First Trust Fund Complex. The annual retainer is allocated equally among each of
the trusts. No additional meeting fees are paid in connection with board or
committee meetings.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $10,000 annually and the
Audit Committee Chairman is paid $5,000 annually and each of the Chairmen of the
Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee is paid $2,500
annually to serve in such capacities, with such compensation paid by the trusts
in the First Trust Fund Complex and equally allocated among those trusts.
Trustees are also reimbursed by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. The Lead
Independent Trustee and each Committee chairman will serve two-year terms ending
December 31, 2009 before rotating to serve as a chairman of another committee or
as Lead Independent Trustee. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no
compensation from the trusts for serving in such capacities.

                     4. Purchases and Sales of Investments

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the year ended May 31, 2009 were $75,403,209 and $237,164,035,
respectively.

       First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                               May 31, 2009


                       5. Auction Market Preferred Shares

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of May 31, 2009, the Fund has
1,600 Series A AMP Shares and 1,600 Series B AMP Shares outstanding at a
liquidation value of $25,000 per share.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date. The Fund pays commissions to the auction agent as
compensation for conducting the auctions. These fees are included in the
"Auction Market Preferred Shares commission fees" on the Statement of
Operations.

The markets for auction rate securities have continued to experience a number of
failed auctions, including auctions relating to the Series A AMP Shares and
Series B AMP Shares. A failed auction results when there are not enough bidders
in the auction at rates below the maximum rate as prescribed by the terms of the
security. When an auction fails, the rate is automatically set at the maximum
rate. A failed auction does not cause an acceleration of, or otherwise have any
impact on, outstanding principal amounts due. In the case of the Fund's
outstanding Series A AMP Shares and Series B AMP Shares, the maximum rate under
the terms of those securities has been 125 percent (and could be up to 300
percent, depending on the ratings of the Series A AMP Shares and Series B AMP
Shares) of the greater of: (1) the applicable AA financial composite commercial
paper rate (for a rate period of fewer than 184 days) or the applicable U.S.
Treasury index rate (for a rate period of 184 days or more), or (2) the
applicable London Inter-Bank Offered Rate.

On July 2, 2008, the Fund redeemed $20 million of its $100 million outstanding
AMP Shares at par ($25,000 per share), consisting of $10 million Series A AMP
Shares and $10 million Series B AMP Shares with proceeds from a Revolving Credit
Facility ("Credit Facility" - see Note 6 below).

 For the year ended May 31, 2009, transactions in AMP shares were as follows:

                                   Series A                   Series B
                                        Liquidation               Liquidation
                              Shares       Value         Shares       Value
                              -------------------------------------------------
Outstanding at 5/31/08        2,000   $  50,000,000      2,000   $  50,000,000
Amount Retired                 (400)    (10,000,000)      (400)    (10,000,000)
                              -------------------------------------------------
Outstanding at 5/31/09        1,600   $  40,000,000      1,600   $  40,000,000
                              =================================================

First Trust continues to seek methods for refinancing the approximately $80
million of the Fund's AMP Shares that remain outstanding. The ability to obtain
refinancing is contingent on finding third parties willing to provide such
financing on a cost effective basis. There is no assurance that First Trust will
be successful in finding such financing, and any such financing arrangements
would be subject to approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of May 31, 2009 was 1.53% and 1.66% for
the Series A 7 day and Series B 28 day auctions, respectively. The dividend
rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates, however, when an auction fails, the rate is
automatically set at the maximum rate as prescribed by the terms of the
security. The high and low annual dividend rates during the year ended May 31,
2009, for the Series A 7 day auction were 5.94% and 1.49%, respectively, and the
average dividend rate was 2.69%. The high and low annual dividend rates during
the year ended May 31, 2009, for the Series B 28 day auction were 5.00% and
1.59%, respectively, and the average dividend rate was 2.91%. These rates may
vary in a manner not related directly to the income received on the Fund's
assets, which could have either a beneficial or detrimental impact on net
investment income and gains available to Common Shareholders.

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, "Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities", which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.


                                                                         Page 27

       First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                               May 31, 2009


                          6. Revolving Credit Facility

The Fund has entered into a Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") with
various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be used as
leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of May 13,
2010 and may be renewed annually. The Credit Facility provides for a secured
line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made
to the Fund. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after
any such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of
the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit
Facility was reduced from $195,000,000 to $150,000,000 on May 15, 2009 in
connection with the annual extension of the expiration date of the Credit
Facility. For the year ended May 31, 2009, the average amount outstanding was
$124,091,781. The loans under the Credit Facility funded by the Conduit Lender
bear interest for each settlement period at a rate per annum based on the
commercial paper rate of the Conduit Lender. The loans under the Credit Facility
funded by the Secondary Lenders bear interest for each settlement period at a
per annum rate equal to (i) the Eurodollar rate for the settlement period plus
7.50% or (ii) the alternate base rate plus 5.00%. For the year ended May 31,
2009, the Fund had no loans under the Credit Facility funded by the Secondary
Lenders. The high and low annual interest rates for loans under the Credit
Facility funded by the Conduit Lender during the year ended May 31, 2009, were
3.74% and 0.60%, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.60%.
The annual interest rate in effect for such loans at May 31, 2009 was 0.82%. The
Fund also pays additional borrowing costs, which include a program fee of 1.50%
and a liquidity fee of 0.75% per year. On May 15, 2009 in connection with the
annual extension of the expiration date of the Credit Facility, the Fund paid
upfront fees of $1,125,000, which will be amortized over a one-year period. Such
expenses are included in "Interest and fees on loan" on the Statement of
Operations.

                             7. Risk Considerations

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some of the risks
that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information about the
risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund regulatory
filings.

Investment and Market Risk: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the investments owned by the Fund. The value of these investments, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Investment prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines that it
is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that it is
impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred and
trading in the investments is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

The Fund's performance was adversely impacted by the weakness in the credit
markets and broad stock market that occurred beginning in late 2008, and may
continue to be adversely affected if the weakness in the credit and stock
markets continue. In response to the financial crises affecting the banking
system and financial markets, the U.S. and foreign governments have intervened
to an unprecedented degree in the financial and credit markets. Among other
things, U.S. government regulators have encouraged, and in some cases structured
and provided financial assistance for, banks, securities firms, insurers and
other financial companies. Additional intervention programs have been adopted
and proposed which will have a further impact on the securities markets. Many of
the recently enacted or proposed government measures are far-reaching and
without historical precedent. Furthermore, the U.S. government has stated its
willingness to implement additional measures as it may see fit to address
changes in market conditions. There can be no assurance that any or all of these
measures will succeed in stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S.
financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility currently being
experienced. Such continued volatility could materially and adversely affect the
financial condition of the Fund.

Lower Grade Debt Instruments: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally lower grade. These lower grade debt instruments may become the subject
of bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise subsequently default as to the repayment
of principal and/or payment of interest or be downgraded to ratings in the lower
rating categories. Lower grade debt instruments tend to be less liquid than
higher grade debt instruments.

Leverage Risk: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. The Fund borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing
program and through the issuance of Preferred Shares, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares and the holders of Preferred Shares, with
respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in
compliance with certain Credit Facility provisions, the Fund may not be
permitted to declare dividends or other distributions, including dividends and
distributions with respect to Common Shares or Preferred Shares or purchase
Common Shares or Preferred Shares.

Senior Loan Risk: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                                  May 31, 2009


to credit risks with respect to that lender. The value of the collateral may not
equal the Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline
below the principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's
investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the
borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the
stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or
substantially all of its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under
collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior
Loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of
non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be
readily liquidated.

Auction Risk: Numerous closed-end funds, including the Fund, have been
experiencing failed auctions involving their auction-rate Preferred Shares.
Based on current market conditions, the Fund expects that auctions may continue
to fail. If an auction fails a holder may not be able to sell some or all of its
Preferred Shares. No third parties related to the auction nor the Fund itself
are obligated to purchase Preferred Shares in an auction or otherwise, nor is
the Fund required to redeem Preferred Shares in the event of a failed auction.

                               8. Indemnification

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              9. Subsequent Events

On May 20, 2009, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0475 per share to Common
Shareholders of record June 3, 2009, payable June 15, 2009.

On June 22, 2009, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0375 per share to Common
Shareholders of record July 6, 2009, payable July 15, 2009.

On July 20, 2009, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0325 per share to Common
Shareholders of record August 5, 2009, payable August 17, 2009.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of First Trust/Four Corners Senior
Floating Rate Income Fund II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of May 31, 2009, and the related statement of
operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of investments owned as of May 31, 2009 by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, agent banks, and brokers; where replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2009, the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,
and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                            May 31, 2009 (Unaudited)


                           Dividend Reinvestment Plan

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by PNC
Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

    (1) If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at the
        time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price equal to
        the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or (ii) 95% of the
        market price on that date.

    (2) If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
        Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will
        purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere, for
        the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price for the
        Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its
        purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the
        Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time of valuation,
        resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or
        distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The Plan
        Agent will use all dividends and distributions received in cash to
        purchase Common Shares in the open market within 30 days of the
        valuation date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
        purchases is necessary to comply with federal securities laws. Interest
        will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (800) 331-1710, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PNC Global Investment
Servicing (U.S.) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                Investment Management and Sub-Advisory Agreements

Board Consideration Regarding Continuation of
Investment Management and Sub-Advisory Contracts

The Board of Trustees of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II (the "Fund"), including the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved
the continuation of the Investment Management Agreement (the "Advisory
Agreement") between the Fund and First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor") and
the Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (the "Sub-Advisory Agreement" and together
with the Advisory Agreement, the "Agreements") among the Fund, the Advisor and
Four Corners Capital Management, LLC (the "Sub-Advisor"), at a meeting held on
March 1-2, 2009. The Board determined that the terms of the Agreements are fair
and reasonable and that the Agreements continue to be in the best interests of
the Fund.

To reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as well as under
the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving advisory
contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the fiduciary duty
of investment advisors with respect to advisory agreements and compensation; the
standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have
fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by the Board in voting
on such agreements. To assist the Board in its evaluation of the Agreements, the
Independent Trustees received a separate report from each of the Advisor and the
Sub-Advisor in advance of the Board meeting responding to a request for
information from counsel to the Independent Trustees. The reports, among other
things, outlined the services provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor
(including the relevant personnel responsible for these services and their
experience); the advisory and sub-advisory fees for the Fund as compared to fees
charged to other clients of the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor and as compared to
fees charged by investment advisors and sub-advisors to comparable funds;
expenses of the Fund as compared to expense ratios of comparable funds; the
nature of expenses incurred in providing services to the Fund and the potential
for economies of scale, if any; financial data on the Advisor and the
Sub-Advisor; any fall-out benefits to the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor; and
information on the Advisor's and the Sub-Advisor's compliance programs. The
Independent Trustees also met separately with their independent legal counsel to
discuss the information provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor. The Board
applied its business judgment to determine whether the arrangements between the
Fund and the Advisor and among the Fund, the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor are
reasonable business arrangements from the Fund's perspective as well as from the
perspective of shareholders.

In reviewing the Agreements, the Board considered the nature, quality and extent
of services provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor under the Agreements.
The Board considered the Advisor's statements regarding the incremental benefits
associated with the Fund's advisor/sub-advisor management structure. With
respect to the Advisory Agreement, the Board considered that the Advisor is
responsible for the overall management and administration of the Fund, including
the oversight of the Sub-Advisor. The Board noted the compliance program that
had been developed by the Advisor and considered that the compliance program

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                            May 31, 2009 (Unaudited)


includes policies and procedures for monitoring the Sub-Advisor's compliance
with the 1940 Act and the Fund's investment objectives and policies. The Board
also noted the enhancements made by the Advisor to the compliance program in
2008. With respect to the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board received a
presentation from representatives of the Sub-Advisor discussing the services
that the Sub-Advisor provides to the Fund and how the Sub-Advisor manages the
Fund's investments. The Board noted that Macquarie Group Limited increased its
ownership stake in the Sub-Advisor to 100% in October 2008 and considered that
the Sub-Advisor's access to a greater breadth of resources should benefit the
Fund. In light of the information presented and the considerations made, the
Board concluded that the nature, quality and extent of services provided to the
Fund by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor under the Agreements have been and are
expected to remain satisfactory and that the Sub-Advisor, under the oversight of
the Advisor, has managed the Fund consistent with its investment objectives and
policies.

The Board considered the advisory and sub-advisory fees paid under the
Agreements. The Board considered the advisory fees paid to the Advisor by
similar funds, and noted that the Advisor does not provide advisory services to
clients with investment objectives and policies similar to the Fund's other than
to two other closed end funds to which different advisory fee rates are charged.
The Board also considered information provided by the Sub-Advisor as to the fees
it charges to other similar clients, noting that the Sub-Advisor sub-advises the
same two other closed-end funds with similar investment objectives and policies,
to which different sub-advisory fee rates are charged. In addition, the Board
received data prepared by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"), an independent source, showing
the management fees and expense ratios of the Fund as compared to the management
fees and expense ratios of a combined peer group selected by Lipper and the
Advisor. The Board discussed with representatives of the Advisor the limitations
in creating a relevant peer group for the Fund, including that (i) the peer
funds may use different types of leverage which have different costs associated
with them; (ii) most peer funds do not employ an advisor/sub-advisor management
structure; (iii) the peer funds may not have the same fiscal year as the Fund,
which may cause the expense data used by Lipper to be measured over different
time periods; (iv) many of the peer funds are larger than the Fund; and (v) many
of the peer funds have an inception date prior to the Fund's inception date and
their fee and expense structures may not reflect newer pricing practices in the
market. The Board reviewed the Lipper materials, but based on its discussions
with the Advisor, the Board determined that the Lipper data was of limited value
for purposes of its consideration of the renewal of the Agreements.

The Board also considered performance information for the Fund, noting that,
similar to almost all other funds, the Fund's performance was impacted by the
severe market downturn in 2008. The Board noted that the performance information
included the Fund's quarterly performance report, which is part of the process
that the Board has established for monitoring the Fund's performance on an
ongoing basis. The Board determined that this process continues to be effective
for reviewing the Fund's performance. In addition to the Board's ongoing review
of performance, the Board also received data prepared by Lipper comparing the
Fund's performance to the combined peer group selected by Lipper and the
Advisor, as well as to a larger group and to a benchmark. The Board reviewed the
Lipper materials, but for similar reasons to those described above, the Board
determined that the performance data provided by Lipper was of limited value.
The Board considered changes made to the Fund's leverage arrangements in 2008 as
a result of market events and considered an analysis prepared by the Advisor on
the continued benefits provided by the Fund's leverage. In addition, the Board
considered the market price and net asset value performance of the Fund since
inception, and compared the Fund's premium/discount to the average and median
premium/discount of the combined peer group, noting that the Fund's
premium/discount was generally indicative of the asset class and market events.
Based on the information provided and the Board's ongoing review of the Fund's
performance, and taking into account the historic market events of 2008, the
Board concluded that the Fund's performance was reasonable.

On the basis of all the information provided on the fees, expenses and
performance of the Fund, the Board concluded that the advisory and sub-advisory
fees were reasonable and appropriate in light of the nature, quality and extent
of services provided by the Advisor and Sub-Advisor under the Agreements.

The Board noted that the Advisor has continued to invest in personnel and
infrastructure and had noted that the advisory fee is not structured to pass the
benefits of any economies of scale on to the shareholders as the Fund's assets
grow. The Board concluded that the management fee reflects an appropriate level
of sharing of any economies of scale. The Board also considered the costs of the
services provided and profits realized by the Advisor from serving as investment
manager to closed-end funds for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008, as
set forth in the materials provided to the Board. The Board noted the inherent
limitations in the profitability analysis, and concluded that the Advisor's
profitability appeared to be not excessive in light of the services provided to
the Fund. In addition, the Board considered and discussed any ancillary benefits
derived by the Advisor from its relationship with the Fund and noted that the
typical fall-out benefits to the Advisor such as soft dollars are not present.
The Board concluded that any other fall-out benefits received by the Advisor or
its affiliates would appear to be limited.

The Board considered that the Sub-Advisor's investment services expenses are
primarily fixed, and that the Sub-Advisor had previously invested in personnel
and systems and anticipated continued maintenance of efficient personnel and
systems in support of the Fund. The Board considered that the sub-advisory fee
rate was negotiated at arm's length between the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor, an
unaffiliated third party. The Board also considered data provided by the
Sub-Advisor as to the profitability of the Sub-Advisory Agreement to the
Sub-Advisor, noting that the method used to allocate expenses was not a typical
practice of the Sub-Advisor. The Board noted the inherent limitations in this
profitability analysis and concluded that the profitability analysis for the
Advisor was more relevant, although the profitability of the Sub-Advisory
Agreement appeared to be not excessive in light of the services provided to the
Fund. The Board noted that the Sub-Advisor does not maintain any soft-dollar
arrangements and that the Sub-Advisor indicated that it does not receive any
material fall-out benefits from its relationship to the Fund.

Based on all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, determined that the terms of the
Agreements continue to be fair and reasonable and that the continuation of the
Agreements is in the best interests of the Fund. No single factor was
determinative in the Board's analysis.

         (c) TAX FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of the
last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal
accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning to the registrant
were $5,000 in 2008 and $5,200 in 2009. These fees were for tax consultation and
tax preparation.

             TAX FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in each
of the last two fiscal years of the registrant for professional services
rendered by the principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax
planning to the registrant's adviser were $0 for 2008 and $0 for 2009.

         (d) ALL OTHER FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of
the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the principal
accountant to the registrant, other than the services reported in paragraphs (a)
through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2008 and $0 for 2009.

             ALL OTHER FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in
each of the last two fiscal years for products and services provided by the
principal accountant to the Registrant's investment adviser, other than services
reported in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this Item were $0 for 2008 and $0 for
2009.

  (e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
         described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

         Pursuant to its charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services
Pre-Approval Policy, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is responsible for
the pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services
(including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Registrant by its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the Committee authorized to give such
pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up to $25,000 and report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

         The Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the
independent auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's
adviser (not including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio
management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser) and
any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the
investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the
engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the
Registrant, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services
described in Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has
provided non-audit services to the Registrant's adviser (other than any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is sub-contracted
with or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser that provides
ongoing services to the Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its
policies, the Committee will consider whether the provision of such non-audit
services is compatible with the auditor's independence.


  (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
         (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser of this
         Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to the
         pre-approval exceptions included in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph
         (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

                           (b)  0%

                           (c)  0%

                           (d)  0%

(f)      The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
         engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons
         other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees
         was less than fifty percent.

(g)      The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
         services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
         investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the Registrant for 2008 were $5,000 and $14,500 for the Registrant
         and the Registrant's investment adviser, respectively, and for 2009
         were $5,200 and $6,000 for the Registrant and the Registrant's
         investment adviser, respectively.

(h)      The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined
         that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
         Registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
         role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
         overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
         controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that
         provides ongoing services to the Registrant that were not pre-approved
         pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is
         compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.



ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

     (a) The registrant has a separately designated standing audit committee
         consisting of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The
         members of the audit committee are: Thomas R. Kadlec, Niel B. Nielson,
         Richard E. Erickson and Robert F. Keith.



ITEM 6. INVESTMENTS.

(a)   Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the
      close of the reporting period is included as part of the report to
      shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

(b)   Not applicable.



ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.



                            FIRST TRUST ADVISORS L.P.
                                FIRST TRUST FUNDS
                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

         First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Adviser") serves as investment adviser
providing discretionary investment advisory services for open and closed-end
investment companies (the "Funds"). As part of these services, the Adviser has
full responsibility for proxy voting and related duties. In fulfilling these
duties, the Adviser and Funds have adopted the following policies and
procedures:

          1. It is the Adviser's policy to seek to ensure that proxies for
securities held by a Fund are voted consistently and solely in the best economic
interests of the respective Fund.

          2. The Adviser shall be responsible for the oversight of a Fund's
proxy voting process and shall assign a senior member of its staff to be
responsible for this oversight.

          3. The Adviser has engaged the services of Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. ("ISS") to make recommendations to the Adviser on the voting of
proxies related to securities held by a Fund. ISS provides voting
recommendations based on established guidelines and practices. The Adviser has
adopted these ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines.

          4. The Adviser shall review the ISS recommendations and generally will
vote the proxies in accordance with such recommendations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Adviser may not vote in accordance with the ISS recommendations
if the Adviser believes that the specific ISS recommendation is not in the best
interests of the respective Fund.

          5. If the Adviser manages the assets or pension fund of a company and
any of the Adviser's clients hold any securities in that company, the Adviser
will vote proxies relating to such company's securities in accordance with the
ISS recommendations to avoid any conflict of interest. In addition, if the
Adviser has actual knowledge of any other type of material conflict of interest
between itself and the respective Fund with respect to the voting of a proxy,
the Adviser shall vote the applicable proxy in accordance with the ISS
recommendations to avoid such conflict of interest.

          6. If a Fund requests the Adviser to follow specific voting guidelines
or additional guidelines, the Adviser shall review the request and follow such
guidelines, unless the Adviser determines that it is unable to follow such
guidelines. In such case, the Adviser shall inform the Fund that it is not able
to follow the Fund's request.

          7. The Adviser may have clients in addition to the Funds which have
provided the Adviser with discretionary authority to vote proxies on their
behalf. In such cases, the Adviser shall follow the same policies and
procedures.

                       (Digest of Selected Key Guidelines)

                                January 15, 2009

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. OPERATIONAL ITEMS:

Auditor Ratification
Vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the following apply:

     o   An auditor has a financial interest in or association with the company,
         and is therefore not independent;

     o   There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an
         opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
         financial position;

     o   Poor accounting practices are identified that rise to a serious level
         of concern, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; and material
         weaknesses identified in Section 404 disclosures; or

     o   Fees for non-audit services ("Other" fees) are excessive.

Non-audit fees are excessive if:

     o   Non-audit ("other") fees exceed audit fees + audit-related fees + tax
         compliance/preparation fees

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to prohibit or limit
their auditors from engaging in non-audit services.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking for audit firm rotation,
taking into account:

     o   The tenure of the audit firm;

     o   The length of rotation specified in the proposal;

     o   Any significant audit-related issues at the company;

     o   The number of Audit Committee meetings held each year;

     o   The number of financial experts serving on the committee; and

     o   Whether the company has a periodic renewal process where the auditor is
         evaluated for both audit quality and competitive price.


2. BOARD OF DIRECTORS:

Voting on Director(1) Nominees in Uncontested Elections Vote on director
nominees should be determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD(2) from individual directors who:

____________________

(1) RiskMetrics' classification of directors can be found in U.S. Proxy Voting
Guidelines Summary.

(2) In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use "Withhold" as the
valid opposition vote option in director elections; companies with a majority
vote standard use "Against". However, it will vary by company and the proxy must
be checked to determine the valid opposition vote for the particular company.



<PAGE>



     o   Attend less than 75 percent of the board and committee meetings without
         a valid excuse, such as illness, service to the nation, work on behalf
         of the company, or funeral obligations. If the company provides
         meaningful public or private disclosure explaining the director's
         absences, evaluate the information on a CASE-BY-CASE basis taking into
         account the following factors:

- -        Degree to which absences were due to an unavoidable conflict;

- -        Pattern of absenteeism; and

- -        Other extraordinary circumstances underlying the director's absence;

     o   Sit on more than six public company boards;

     o   Are CEOs of public companies who sit on the boards of more than two
         public companies besides their own-- withhold only at their outside
         boards.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from all nominees of the board of directors, (except
from new nominees, who should be considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis) if:

     o   The company's proxy indicates that not all directors attended 75% of
         the aggregate of their board and committee meetings, but fails to
         provide the required disclosure of the names of the directors involved.
         If this information cannot be obtained, vote against/withhold from all
         incumbent directors;

     o   The company's poison pill has a dead-hand or modified dead-hand
         feature. Vote against/withhold every year until this feature is
         removed;

     o   The board adopts or renews a poison pill without shareholder approval,
         does not commit to putting it to shareholder vote within 12 months of
         adoption (or in the case of an newly public company, does not commit to
         put the pill to a shareholder vote within 12 months following the IPO),
         or reneges on a commitment to put the pill to a vote, and has not yet
         received a withhold/against recommendation for this issue;

     o   The board failed to act on a shareholder proposal that received
         approval by a majority of the shares outstanding the previous year (a
         management proposal with other than a FOR recommendation by management
         will not be considered as sufficient action taken);

     o   The board failed to act on a shareholder proposal that received
         approval of the majority of shares cast for the previous two
         consecutive years (a management proposal with other than a FOR
         recommendation by management will not be considered as sufficient
         action taken);

     o   The board failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of the
         shareholders tendered their shares;

     o   At the previous board election, any director received more than 50
         percent withhold/against votes of the shares cast and the company has
         failed to address the underlying issue(s) that caused the high
         withhold/against vote;

     o   The board is classified, and a continuing director responsible for a
         problematic governance issue at the board/committee level that would
         warrant a withhold/against vote recommendation is not up for election-
         any or all appropriate nominees (except new) may be held accountable;

     o   The board lacks accountability and oversight, coupled with sustained
         poor performance relative to peers. Sustained poor performance is
         measured by one- and three-year total shareholder returns in the bottom
         half of a company's four-digit GICS industry group (Russell 3000
         companies only).

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from Inside Directors and Affiliated Outside Directors
(per the Classification of Directors below) when:


<PAGE>


     o   The inside or affiliated outside director serves on any of the three
         key committees: audit, compensation, or nominating;

     o   The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so
         that the full board functions as that committee;

     o   The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if board attests
         that the independent directors fulfill the functions of such a
         committee;

     o   The full board is less than majority independent.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from the members of the Audit Committee if:

     o   The non-audit fees paid to the auditor are excessive;

     o   The company receives an adverse opinion on the company's financial
         statements from its auditor; or

     o   There is persuasive evidence that the audit committee entered into an
         inappropriate indemnification agreement with its auditor that limits
         the ability of the company, or its shareholders, to pursue legitimate
         legal recourse against the audit firm.

Vote CASE-by-CASE on members of the Audit Committee and/or the full board if
poor accounting practices, which rise to a level of serious concern are
indentified, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; and material weaknesses
identified in Section 404 disclosures.

Examine the severity, breadth, chronological sequence and duration, as well as
the company's efforts at remediation or corrective actions in determining
whether negative vote recommendations are warranted against the members of the
Audit Committee who are responsible for the poor accounting practices, or the
entire board.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from the members of the Compensation Committee if:

     o   There is a negative correlation between the chief executive's pay and
         company performance (see discussion under Equity Compensation Plans);

     o   The company reprices underwater options for stock, cash or other
         consideration without prior shareholder approval, even if allowed in
         their equity plan;

     o   The company fails to submit one-time transfers of stock options to a
         shareholder vote;

     o   The company fails to fulfill the terms of a burn rate commitment they
         made to shareholders;

     o   The company has backdated options (see "Options Backdating" policy);

The company has poor compensation practices (see "Poor Pay Practices" policy).
Poor pay practices may warrant withholding votes from the CEO and potentially
the entire board as well.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from directors, individually or the entire board, for
egregious actions or failure to replace management as appropriate.


Independent Chair (Separate Chair/CEO)
Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requiring that the chairman's position
be filled by an independent director, unless the company satisfies all of the
following criteria:

The company maintains the following counterbalancing features:

     o   Designated lead director, elected by and from the independent board
         members with clearly delineated and comprehensive duties. (The role may
         alternatively reside with a presiding director, vice chairman, or
         rotating lead director; however the director must serve a minimum of
         one year in order to qualify as a lead director.) The duties should
         include, but are not limited to, the following:

         -  presides at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is not
            present, including executive sessions of the independent directors;


<PAGE>


         -  serves as liaison between the chairman and the independent
            directors;

         -  approves information sent to the board;

         -  approves meeting agendas for the board;

         -  approves meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time
            for discussion of all agenda items;

         -  has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;

         -  if requested by major shareholders, ensures that he is available for
            consultation and direct communication;

     o   Two-thirds independent board;

     o   All independent key committees;

     o   Established governance guidelines;

     o   A company in the Russell 3000 universe must not have exhibited
         sustained poor total shareholder return (TSR) performance, defined as
         one- and three-year TSR in the bottom half of the company's four-digit
         GICS industry group within the Russell 3000 only), unless there has
         been a change in the Chairman/CEO position within that time;

     o   The company does not have any problematic governance or management
         issues, examples of which include, but are not limited to:

         -  Egregious compensation practices;

         -  Multiple related-party transactions or other issues putting director
            independence at risk;

         -  Corporate and/or management scandals;

         -  Excessive problematic corporate governance provisions; or

         -  Flagrant board or management actions with potential or realized
            negative impact on shareholders.


Majority Vote Shareholder Proposals
Generally vote FOR precatory and binding resolutions requesting that the board
change the company's bylaws to stipulate that directors need to be elected with
an affirmative majority of votes cast, provided it does not conflict with the
state law where the company is incorporated. Binding resolutions need to allow
for a carve-out for a plurality vote standard when there are more nominees than
board seats.

Companies are strongly encouraged to also adopt a post-election policy (also
know as a director resignation policy) that provides guidelines so that the
company will promptly address the situation of a holdover director.


Performance/Governance Evaluation for Directors
Vote WITHHOLD/AGAINST on all director nominees if the board lacks accountability
and oversight, coupled with sustained poor performance relative to peers,
measured by one- and three-year total shareholder returns in the bottom half of
a company's four-digit GICS industry group (Russell 3000 companies only).

Evaluate board accountability and oversight at companies that demonstrate
sustained poor performance. Problematic provisions include but are not limited
to:

     o   a classified board structure;

     o   a supermajority vote requirement;

     o   majority vote standard for director elections with no carve out for
         contested elections;

     o   the inability of shareholders to call special meetings;

     o   the inability of shareholders to act by written consent;

     o   a dual-class structure; and/or


<PAGE>


     o   a non-shareholder approved poison pill.

If a company exhibits sustained poor performance coupled with a lack of board
accountability and oversight, also take into consideration the company's
five-year total shareholder return and five-year operational metrics in the
evaluation.


3. PROXY CONTESTS

Voting for Director Nominees in Contested Elections
Vote CASE-BY-CASE on the election of directors in contested elections,
considering the following factors:

     o   Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
         industry;

     o   Management's track record;

     o   Background to the proxy contest;

     o   Qualifications of director nominees (both slates);

     o   Strategic plan of dissident slate and quality of critique against
         management;

     o   Likelihood that the proposed goals and objectives can be achieved (both
         slates);

     o   Stock ownership positions.


Reimbursing Proxy Solicitation Expenses
Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to reimburse proxy solicitation expenses. When
voting in conjunction with support of a dissident slate, vote FOR the
reimbursement of all appropriate proxy solicitation expenses associated with the
election.

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals calling for the reimbursement of
reasonable costs incurred in connection with nominating one or more candidates
in a contested election where the following apply:

     o   The election of fewer than 50% of the directors to be elected is
         contested in the election;

     o   One or more of the dissident's candidates is elected;

     o   Shareholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for directors;
         and

     o   The election occurred, and the expenses were incurred, after the
         adoption of this bylaw.


4. ANTITAKEOVER DEFENSES AND VOTING RELATED ISSUES

Advance Notice Requirements for Shareholder Proposals/Nominations
Vote CASE-BY-CASE on advance notice proposals, giving support to proposals that
allow shareholders to submit proposals/nominations reasonably close to the
meeting date and within the broadest window possible, recognizing the need to
allow sufficient notice for company, regulatory and shareholder review.

To be reasonable, the company's deadline for shareholder notice of a proposal/
nominations must not be more than 60 days prior to the meeting, with a submittal
window of at least 30 days prior to the deadline.

In general, support additional efforts by companies to ensure full disclosure in
regard to a proponent's economic and voting position in the company so long as
the informational requirements are reasonable and aimed at providing
shareholders with the necessary information to review such proposal.


Poison Pills
Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that the company submit its poison
pill to a shareholder vote or redeem it UNLESS the company has: (1) A
shareholder approved poison pill in place; or (2) The company has adopted a



<PAGE>



policy concerning the adoption of a pill in the future specifying that the board
will only adopt a shareholder rights plan if either:

     o   Shareholders have approved the adoption of the plan; or

     o   The board, in exercising its fiduciary responsibilities, determines
         that it is in the best interest of shareholders under the circumstances
         to adopt a pill without the delay that would result from seeking
         stockholder approval (i.e., the "fiduciary out" provision). A poison
         pill adopted under this "fiduciary out" will be put to a shareholder
         ratification vote within 12 months of adoption or expire. If the pill
         is not approved by a majority of the votes cast on this issue, the plan
         will immediately terminate.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals calling for poison pills to be put to a vote
within a time period of less than one year after adoption. If the company has no
non-shareholder approved poison pill in place and has adopted a policy with the
provisions outlined above, vote AGAINST the proposal. If these conditions are
not met, vote FOR the proposal, but with the caveat that a vote within 12 months
would be considered sufficient.

Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals on poison pill ratification, focusing
on the features of the shareholder rights plan. Rights plans should contain the
following attributes:

     o   No lower than a 20% trigger, flip-in or flip-over;

     o   A term of no more than three years;

     o   No dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the
         ability of a future board to redeem the pill;

     o   Shareholder redemption feature (qualifying offer clause); if the board
         refuses to redeem the pill 90 days after a qualifying offer is
         announced, 10 percent of the shares may call a special meeting or seek
         a written consent to vote on rescinding the pill.

In addition, the rationale for adopting the pill should be thoroughly explained
by the company. In examining the request for the pill, take into consideration
the company's existing governance structure, including: board independence,
existing takeover defenses, and any problematic governance concerns.

For management proposals to adopt a poison pill for the stated purpose of
preserving a company's net operating losses ("NOL pills"), the following factors
should be considered:

     o   the trigger (NOL pills generally have a trigger slightly below 5%);

     o   the value of the NOLs;

     o   the term;

     o   shareholder protection mechanisms (sunset provision, causing expiration
         of the pill upon exhaustion or expiration of NOLs); and

     o   other factors that may be applicable.

In addition, vote WITHHOLD/AGAINST the entire board of directors, (except new
nominees, who should be considered on a CASE-by-CASE basis) if the board adopts
or renews a poison pill without shareholder approval, does not commit to putting
it to a shareholder vote within 12 months of adoption (or in the case of a newly
public company, does not commit to put the pill to a shareholder vote within 12
months following the IPO), or reneges on a commitment to put the pill to a vote,
and has not yet received a withhold recommendation for this issue.


5. MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS

Overall Approach
For mergers and acquisitions, review and evaluate the merits and drawbacks of
the proposed transaction, balancing various and sometimes countervailing factors
including:



<PAGE>



     o   Valuation - Is the value to be received by the target shareholders (or
         paid by the acquirer) reasonable? While the fairness opinion may
         provide an initial starting point for assessing valuation
         reasonableness, emphasis is placed on the offer premium, market
         reaction and strategic rationale.

     o   Market reaction - How has the market responded to the proposed deal? A
         negative market reaction should cause closer scrutiny of a deal.

     o   Strategic rationale - Does the deal make sense strategically? From
         where is the value derived? Cost and revenue synergies should not be
         overly aggressive or optimistic, but reasonably achievable. Management
         should also have a favorable track record of successful integration of
         historical acquisitions.

     o   Negotiations and process - Were the terms of the transaction negotiated
         at arm's-length? Was the process fair and equitable? A fair process
         helps to ensure the best price for shareholders. Significant
         negotiation "wins" can also signify the deal makers' competency. The
         comprehensiveness of the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial
         auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder value.

     o   Conflicts of interest - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction
         disproportionately and inappropriately as compared to non-insider
         shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and
         officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger
         than if they did not hold these interests. Consider whether these
         interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support
         or recommend the merger. The change-in-control figure presented in the
         "RMG Transaction Summary" section of this report is an aggregate figure
         that can in certain cases be a misleading indicator of the true value
         transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to be
         excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a
         potential conflict exists.

     o   Governance - Will the combined company have a better or worse
         governance profile than the current governance profiles of the
         respective parties to the transaction? If the governance profile is to
         change for the worse, the burden is on the company to prove that other
         issues (such as valuation) outweigh any deterioration in governance.


6. STATE OF INCORPORATION

Reincorporation Proposals
Evaluate management or shareholder proposals to change a company's state of
incorporation on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, giving consideration to both financial
and corporate governance concerns including the following:

     o   Reasons for reincorporation;

     o   Comparison of company's governance practices and provisions prior to
         and following the reincorporation; and

     o   Comparison of corporation laws of original state and destination state

Vote FOR reincorporation when the economic factors outweigh any neutral or
negative governance changes.


7. CAPITAL STRUCTURE

Common Stock Authorization
Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of shares of common stock
authorized for issuance. Take into account company-specific factors which
include, at a minimum, the following:

     o   Specific reasons/ rationale for the proposed increase;

     o   The dilutive impact of the request as determined through an allowable
         cap generated by RiskMetrics' quantitative model;

     o   The board's governance structure and practices; and

     o   Risks to shareholders of not approving the request.


<PAGE>


Vote FOR proposals to approve increases beyond the allowable cap when a
company's shares are in danger of being delisted or if a company's ability to
continue to operate as a going concern is uncertain.


Preferred Stock
Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of shares of preferred
stock authorized for issuance. Take into account company-specific factors which
include, at a minimum, the following:

     o   Specific reasons/ rationale for the proposed increase;

     o   The dilutive impact of the request as determined through an allowable
         cap generated by RiskMetrics' quantitative model;

     o   The board's governance structure and practices; and

     o   Risks to shareholders of not approving the request.

Vote AGAINST proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred
stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other
rights ("blank check" preferred stock).

Vote FOR proposals to create "declawed" blank check preferred stock (stock that
cannot be used as a takeover defense).

Vote FOR proposals to authorize preferred stock in cases where the company
specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and
the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.

Vote AGAINST proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred stock
authorized for issuance when no shares have been issued or reserved for a
specific purpose.


8. EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION


Equity Compensation Plans

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on equity-based compensation plans. Vote AGAINST the equity
plan if any of the following factors apply:

     o   The total cost of the company's equity plans is unreasonable;

     o   The plan expressly permits the repricing of stock options/stock
         appreciation rights (SARs) without prior shareholder approval;

     o   The CEO is a participant in the proposed equity-based compensation plan
         and there is a disconnect between CEO pay and the company's performance
         where over 50 percent of the year-over-year increase is attributed to
         equity awards;

     o   The company's three year burn rate exceeds the greater of 2% and the
         mean plus one standard deviation of its industry group;

     o   The plan provides for the acceleration of vesting of equity awards even
         though an actual change in control may not occur (e.g., upon
         shareholder approval of a transaction or the announcement of a tender
         offer); or

     o   The plan is a vehicle for poor pay practices.


Poor Pay Practices
Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from compensation committee members, CEO, and
potentially the entire board, if the company has poor compensation practices.
Vote AGAINST equity plans if the plan is a vehicle for poor compensation
practices.

The following practices, while not exhaustive, are examples of poor compensation
practices that may warrant withhold vote recommendations:


<PAGE>


     o   Egregious employment contracts - Contracts containing multi-year
         guarantees for salary increases, bonuses and equity compensation;

     o   Excessive perks/tax reimbursements:

         -  Overly generous perquisites, which may include, but are not limited
            to the following: personal use of corporate aircraft, personal
            security system maintenance and/or installation, car allowances;

         -  Reimbursement of income taxes on executive perquisites or other
            payments;

         -  Perquisites for former executives, such as car allowances, personal
            use of corporate aircraft or other inappropriate arrangements;

     Abnormally large bonus payouts without justifiable performance linkage or
     proper disclosure - Performance metrics that are changed, canceled or
     replaced during the performance period without adequate explanation of the
     action and the link to performance;

     o   Egregious pension/SERP (supplemental executive retirement plan)
         payouts:

         -  Inclusion of additional years of service not worked that result in
            significant payouts;

         -  Inclusion of performance-based equity awards in the pension
            calculation;

     o   New CEO with overly generous new hire package:

         -  Excessive "make whole" provisions;

         -  Any of the poor pay practices listed in this policy;

     o   Excessive severance and/or change in control provisions:

         -  Inclusion of excessive change in control or severance payments,
            especially those with a multiple in excess of 3X cash pay;

         -  Payments upon an executive's termination in connection with
            performance failure;

         -  Change in control payouts without loss of job or substantial
            diminution of job duties (single-triggered);

         -  New or materially amended employment or severance agreements that
            provide for modified single triggers, under which an executive may
            voluntarily leave for any reason and still receive the
            change-in-control severance package;

         -  Liberal change in control definition in individual contracts or
            equity plans which could result in payments to executives without an
            actual change in control occurring;

         -  New or materially amended employment or severance agreements that
            provide for an excise tax gross-up. Modified gross-ups would be
            treated in the same manner as full gross-ups;

         -  Perquisites for former executives such as car allowances, personal
            use of corporate aircraft or other inappropriate arrangements;

     o   Dividends or dividend equivalents paid on unvested performance shares
         or units;

     o   Poor disclosure practices:

         -  Unclear explanation of how the CEO is involved in the pay setting
            process;

         -  Retrospective performance targets and methodology not discussed;

         -  Methodology for benchmarking practices and/or peer group not
            disclosed and explained;


<PAGE>


     o   Internal Pay Disparity:

         -  Excessive differential between CEO total pay and that of next
            highest paid named executive officer (NEO);

     o   Options backdating (covered in a separate policy);

     o   Other excessive compensation payouts or poor pay practices at the
         company.



Other Compensation Proposals and Policies


Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation (Say-on-Pay) Management Proposals
Vote CASE-BY-CASE on management proposals for an advisory vote on executive
compensation. Vote AGAINST these resolutions in cases where boards have failed
to demonstrate good stewardship of investors' interests regarding executive
compensation practices.

For U.S. companies, consider the following factors in the context of each
company's specific circumstances and the board's disclosed rationale for its
practices:

     Relative Considerations:

     o   Assessment of performance metrics relative to business strategy, as
         discussed and explained in the CD&A ;

     o   Evaluation of peer groups used to set target pay or award
         opportunities;

     o   Alignment of company performance and executive pay trends over time
         (e.g., performance down: pay down);

     o   Assessment of disparity between total pay of the CEO and other Named
         Executive Officers (NEOs).

     Design Considerations:

     o   Balance of fixed versus performance-driven pay;

     o   Assessment of excessive practices with respect to perks, severance
         packages, supplemental executive pension plans, and burn rates.

     Communication Considerations:

     o   Evaluation of information and board rationale provided in CD&A about
         how compensation is determined (e.g., why certain elements and pay
         targets are used, and specific incentive plan goals, especially
         retrospective goals);

     o   Assessment of board's responsiveness to investor input and engagement
         on compensation issues (e.g., in responding to majority-supported
         shareholder proposals on executive pay topics).


Employee Stock Purchase Plans-- Non-Qualified Plans
Vote CASE-by-CASE on nonqualified employee stock purchase plans. Vote FOR
nonqualified employee stock purchase plans with all the following features:

     o   Broad-based participation (i.e., all employees of the company with the
         exclusion of individuals with 5 percent or more of beneficial ownership
         of the company);

     o   Limits on employee contribution, which may be a fixed dollar amount or
         expressed as a percent of base salary;

     o   Company matching contribution up to 25 percent of employee's
         contribution, which is effectively a discount of 20 percent from market
         value;

     o   No discount on the stock price on the date of purchase since there is a
         company matching contribution.


<PAGE>


Vote AGAINST nonqualified employee stock purchase plans when any of the plan
features do not meet the above criteria. If the company matching contribution
exceeds 25 percent of employee's contribution, evaluate the cost of the plan
against its allowable cap.


Option Exchange Programs/Repricing Options
Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals seeking approval to exchange/reprice
options, taking into consideration:

     o   Historic trading patterns--the stock price should not be so volatile
         that the options are likely to be back "in-the-money" over the near
         term;

     o   Rationale for the re-pricing--was the stock price decline beyond
         management's control?

     o   Is this a value-for-value exchange?

     o   Are surrendered stock options added back to the plan reserve?

     o   Option vesting--does the new option vest immediately or is there a
         black-out period?

     o   Term of the option--the term should remain the same as that of the
         replaced option;

     o   Exercise price--should be set at fair market or a premium to market;

     o   Participants--executive officers and directors should be excluded.

If the surrendered options are added back to the equity plans for re-issuance,
then also take into consideration the company's total cost of equity plans and
its three-year average burn rate.

In addition to the above considerations, evaluate the intent, rationale, and
timing of the repricing proposal. The proposal should clearly articulate why the
board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time.
Repricing underwater options after a recent precipitous drop in the company's
stock price demonstrates poor timing. Repricing after a recent decline in stock
price triggers additional scrutiny and a potential AGAINST vote on the proposal.
At a minimum, the decline should not have happened within the past year. Also,
consider the terms of the surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise
price and vesting schedule. Grant dates of surrendered options should be far
enough back (two to three years) so as not to suggest that repricings are being
done to take advantage of short-term downward price movements. Similarly, the
exercise price of surrendered options should be above the 52-week high for the
stock price.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.


Other Shareholder Proposals on Compensation

Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation (Say-on-Pay)
Generally, vote FOR shareholder proposals that call for non-binding shareholder
ratification of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers and the
accompanying narrative disclosure of material factors provided to understand the
Summary Compensation Table.


Golden Coffins/Executive Death Benefits
Generally vote FOR proposals calling on companies to adopt a policy of obtaining
shareholder approval for any future agreements and corporate policies that could
oblige the company to make payments or awards following the death of a senior
executive in the form of unearned salary or bonuses, accelerated vesting or the
continuation in force of unvested equity grants, perquisites and other payments
or awards made in lieu of compensation. This would not apply to any benefit
programs or equity plan proposals for which the broad-based employee population
is eligible.


Share Buyback Holding Periods
Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals prohibiting executives from selling
shares of company stock during periods in which the company has announced that
it may or will be repurchasing shares of its stock. Vote FOR the proposal when
there is a pattern of abuse by executives exercising options or selling shares
during periods of share buybacks.


<PAGE>


Stock Ownership or Holding Period Guidelines
Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum amount of
stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on
the board. While RMG favors stock ownership on the part of directors, the
company should determine the appropriate ownership requirement.

Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to adopt
policies requiring Named Executive Officers to retain 75% of the shares acquired
through compensation plans while employed and/or for two years following the
termination of their employment, and to report to shareholders regarding this
policy. The following factors will be taken into account:

     o   Whether the company has any holding period, retention ratio, or officer
         ownership requirements in place. These should consist of:

         -  Rigorous stock ownership guidelines, or

         -  A holding period requirement coupled with a significant long-term
            ownership requirement, or

         -  A meaningful retention ratio,

     o   Actual officer stock ownership and the degree to which it meets or
         exceeds the proponent's suggested holding period/retention ratio or the
         company's own stock ownership or retention requirements.

     o   Problematic pay practices, current and past, which may promote a
         short-term versus a long-term focus.


Tax Gross-Up Proposals
Generally vote FOR proposals asking companies to adopt a policy of not providing
tax gross-up payments to executives, except where gross-ups are provided
pursuant to a plan, policy, or arrangement applicable to management employees of
the company, such as a relocation or expatriate tax equalization policy.


9. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) ISSUES

Overall Approach
When evaluating social and environmental shareholder proposals, RMG considers
the following factors:

     o   Whether adoption of the proposal is likely to enhance or protect
         shareholder value;

     o   Whether the information requested concerns business issues that relate
         to a meaningful percentage of the company's business as measured by
         sales, assets, and earnings;

     o   The degree to which the company's stated position on the issues raised
         in the proposal could affect its reputation or sales, or leave it
         vulnerable to a boycott or selective purchasing;

     o   Whether the issues presented are more appropriately/effectively dealt
         with through governmental or company-specific action;

     o   Whether the company has already responded in some appropriate manner to
         the request embodied in the proposal;

     o   Whether the company's analysis and voting recommendation to
         shareholders are persuasive;

     o   What other companies have done in response to the issue addressed in
         the proposal;

     o   Whether the proposal itself is well framed and the cost of preparing
         the report is reasonable;

     o   Whether implementation of the proposal's request would achieve the
         proposal's objectives;

     o   Whether the subject of the proposal is best left to the discretion of
         the board;

     o   Whether the requested information is available to shareholders either
         from the company or from a publicly available source; and


<PAGE>


     o   Whether providing this information would reveal proprietary or
         confidential information that would place the company at a competitive
         disadvantage.


Genetically Modified Ingredients
Generally vote AGAINST proposals asking suppliers, genetic research companies,
restaurants and food retail companies to voluntarily label genetically
engineered (GE) ingredients in their products and/or eliminate GE ingredients.
The cost of labeling and/or phasing out the use of GE ingredients may not be
commensurate with the benefits to shareholders and is an issue better left to
regulators.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking for a report on the feasibility of
labeling products containing GE ingredients taking into account:

     o   The company's business and the proportion of it affected by the
         resolution;

     o   The quality of the company's disclosure on GE product labeling, related
         voluntary initiatives, and how this disclosure compares with industry
         peer disclosure; and

     o   Company's current disclosure on the feasibility of GE product labeling,
         including information on the related costs.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals seeking a report on the social, health, and
environmental effects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Studies of this
sort are better undertaken by regulators and the scientific community.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to completely phase out GE ingredients from the
company's products or proposals asking for reports outlining the steps necessary
to eliminate GE ingredients from the company's products. Such resolutions
presuppose that there are proven health risks to GE ingredients (an issue better
left to regulators) that may outweigh the economic benefits derived from
biotechnology.


Pharmaceutical Pricing, Access to Medicines, and Product Reimportation
Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting that companies implement specific
price restraints on pharmaceutical products unless the company fails to adhere
to legislative guidelines or industry norms in its product pricing.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals requesting that the company report on their
product pricing policies or their access to medicine policies, considering:

     o   The nature of the company's business and the potential for reputational
         and market risk exposure;

     o   The existing disclosure of relevant policies;

     o   Deviation from established industry norms;

     o   The company's existing, relevant initiatives to provide research and/or
         products to disadvantaged consumers;

     o   Whether the proposal focuses on specific products or geographic
         regions; and

     o   The potential cost and scope of the requested report.

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting that companies report on the financial
and legal impact of their prescription drug reimportation policies unless such
information is already publicly disclosed.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting that companies adopt specific
policies to encourage or constrain prescription drug reimportation. Such matters
are more appropriately the province of legislative activity and may place the
company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its peers.


Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Domestic Partner Benefits
Generally vote FOR proposals seeking to amend a company's EEO statement or
diversity policies to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or
gender identity, unless the change would result in excessive costs for the
company.


<PAGE>


Generally vote AGAINST proposals to extend company benefits to, or eliminate
benefits from domestic partners. Decisions regarding benefits should be left to
the discretion of the company.


Climate Change
Generally vote FOR resolutions requesting that a company disclose information on
the impact of climate change on the company's operations and investments
considering whether:

     o   The company already provides current, publicly-available information on
         the impacts that climate change may have on the company as well as
         associated company policies and procedures to address related risks
         and/or opportunities;

     o   The company's level of disclosure is at least comparable to that of
         industry peers; and

     o   There are no significant, controversies, fines, penalties, or
         litigation associated with the company's environmental performance.


Lobbying Expenditures/Initiatives
Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals requesting information on a company's lobbying
initiatives, considering:

     o   Significant controversies, fines, or litigation surrounding a company's
         public policy activities,

     o   The company's current level of disclosure on lobbying strategy, and

     o   The impact that the policy issue may have on the company's business
         operations.


Political Contributions and Trade Association Spending
Generally vote AGAINST proposals asking the company to affirm political
nonpartisanship in the workplace so long as:

     o   There are no recent, significant controversies, fines or litigation
         regarding the company's political contributions or trade association
         spending; and

     o   The company has procedures in place to ensure that employee
         contributions to company-sponsored political action committees (PACs)
         are strictly voluntary and prohibits coercion.

Vote AGAINST proposals to publish in newspapers and public media the company's
political contributions. Such publications could present significant cost to the
company without providing commensurate value to shareholders.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to improve the disclosure of a company's
political contributions and trade association spending, considering:

     o   Recent significant controversy or litigation related to the company's
         political contributions or governmental affairs; and

     o   The public availability of a company policy on political contributions
         and trade association spending including information on the types of
         organizations supported, the business rationale for supporting these
         organizations, and the oversight and compliance procedures related to
         such expenditures of corporate assets.

Vote AGAINST proposals barring the company from making political contributions.
Businesses are affected by legislation at the federal, state, and local level
and barring political contributions can put the company at a competitive
disadvantage.

Vote AGAINST proposals asking for a list of company executives, directors,
consultants, legal counsels, lobbyists, or investment bankers that have prior
government service and whether such service had a bearing on the business of the
company. Such a list would be burdensome to prepare without providing any
meaningful information to shareholders.


<PAGE>


Labor and Human Rights Standards
Generally vote FOR proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier
labor and/or human rights standards and policies unless such information is
already publicly disclosed.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to implement company or company supplier labor
and/or human rights standards and policies, considering:

     o   The degree to which existing relevant policies and practices are
         disclosed;

     o   Whether or not existing relevant policies are consistent with
         internationally recognized standards;

     o   Whether company facilities and those of its suppliers are monitored and
         how;

     o   Company participation in fair labor organizations or other
         internationally recognized human rights initiatives;

     o   Scope and nature of business conducted in markets known to have higher
         risk of workplace labor/human rights abuse;

     o   Recent, significant company controversies, fines, or litigation
         regarding human rights at the company or its suppliers;

     o   The scope of the request; and

     o   Deviation from industry sector peer company standards and practices.


Sustainability Reporting
Generally vote FOR proposals requesting the company to report on its policies,
initiatives, and oversight mechanisms related to social, economic, and
environmental sustainability, unless:

     o   The company already discloses similar information through existing
         reports or policies such as an Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS)
         report; a comprehensive Code of Corporate Conduct; and/or a Diversity
         Report; or

     o   The company has formally committed to the implementation of a reporting
         program based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines or a
         similar standard within a specified time frame

Potential Conflicts of Interests

         In general, Four Corners seeks to allocate the purchase and sale of
corporate loans to clients in a fair and equitable manner to quickly and
prudently create a well-constructed, fully invested portfolio of corporate
loans. Since Four Corners' clients have varying investment restrictions, and
because of the constraining mechanics of the corporate loan market, allocation
of trades through methods such as pro-rata allocation are not feasible.
Therefore, the allocation of corporate loan purchases and sales to various
accounts is generally based on factors such as the client's investment
restrictions and objectives, including expected liquidity and/or third party
credit ratings, the client's acceptance or rejection of prospective investments,
if applicable, and the relative percentage of invested assets of a client's
portfolio, among others. Assets may be disproportionately allocated to accounts
during their initial investment (ramp up) period, notwithstanding that other
accounts may also have assets available for investment. Such disproportionate
allocation to accounts during the ramp-up process may have a detrimental effect
on other accounts. Subject to the foregoing, whenever Four Corners' clients have
available funds for investment, investments suitable and appropriate for each
will be allocated in a manner Four Corners believes to be equitable to each,
although such allocation may result in a delay in one or more client accounts
being fully invested that would not occur if an allocation to other client
accounts were not made. Moreover, it is possible that due to differing
investment objectives or for other reasons, Four Corners and its affiliates may
purchase securities or loans of an issuer for one client and at approximately
the same time recommend selling or sell the same or similar types of securities
or loans for another client. For these and other reasons, not all portfolios
will participate in the gains or losses experienced by other portfolios with
similar investment objectives.

(a)(3)   Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management
Team Members

         Portfolio Manager and Management Team compensation is typically
comprised of a base salary and a bonus. There are no pre-determined formulas to
determine base salaries or bonus amounts. Bonuses for all employees, including
the Portfolio Managers, are discretionary. In addition, the Portfolio Managers
have stock options of Macquarie. These options are in varying amounts and are
subject to certain vesting and other provisions of the Macquarie option plan.
Finally, the Portfolio Managers are Members of the entity that Macquarie
recently purchased, and there are certain payments associated with that purchase
which will be paid over time. A portion of those payments is based on achieving
certain revenue targets.


The Portfolio Managers' salaries are set at certain levels and may be raised at
the discretion of Macquarie. Bonuses are entirely discretionary and are likely
to be related to, among other things, business unit profitability and personal
performance. Compensation is determined without regard to the performance of any
one particular fund. The Portfolio Managers and the Management Team have no
direct incentive to take undue risks when individual fund performance is
lagging.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.


                                      -2-


<PAGE>


                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.


                                      -3-


<PAGE>


VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.
