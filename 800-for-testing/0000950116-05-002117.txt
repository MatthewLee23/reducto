Q: PLEASE DESCRIBE THE OVERALL CONDITIONS IN THE MUNICIPAL BOND MARKETS DURING
THE FISCAL YEAR.
A: During the fiscal year, the Federal Reserve embarked upon a tightening
program to gradually eliminate the accommodative stance that has been in place
since 2002-03. Just prior to the start of the fiscal year, the market was
anticipating a higher federal funds rate, and rates across the yield curve moved
up. For example, the 10-year Treasury Note had yields increase by over 100 basis
points (a basis point equals 1/100th of a percent) from 3.68% on March 16, 2004
to a high of 4.87% on June 14, 2004. As bond yields and bond prices are
inversely related, this was a particularly difficult period for bondholders.

However, the municipal bond market dug in its heels and rallied over the next
several months, even while the Federal Reserve started its tightening program.
The June 30 hike in the fed funds rate from 1.00% to 1.25% was the first of
several moves during the fiscal year, with additional 25-basis point increases
coming in August, September, November, December, February and March. At the end
of the fiscal year, the rate was 2.75%.

A market rally in the face of a Federal Reserve tightening is unusual. Recent
tightenings have resulted in the bond markets making an initial move to higher
rates, similar to what we witnessed in the second quarter of 2004, followed by a
period of consolidation before resuming a march to even higher rates. This time
the rally started in June, before the first move by the Fed, and lasted over
four months, until the end of October. During this period, yields on the 10-year
Treasury Note decreased to 3.97%, nearly erasing all the market decline from
earlier in the fiscal year.

Since the end of September, the market has been range-bound with relatively
narrow market moves. One of the economic releases providing support to the
market against the tightening backdrop has been the monthly employment report.
It was higher-than-anticipated non-farm payroll data that spooked the market in
April, May and June, and several very weak releases that sparked the rally in
the months following. Slightly-below trend releases of late have kept the market
range-bound.

Late in the fiscal year, persistent declines in the weekly jobless
claims reports, along with higher commodity prices, contributed to market
weakness and, as of March 31, 2005, yields in the bond markets were rising and
threatening to break out of their recent range on the high side.

In the long maturities, tax-exempt bonds outperformed taxable bonds early in the
fiscal year, but since May, have steadily traded weaker against Treasury bonds,
as the yield ratio between the 30-year maturities moved from 92.3% in mid-May to
96.9% at the period's end. One of the factors leading to the underperformance of
long bonds in the municipal market was the lack of retail demand. Often, a 5%
yield for long, high-grade tax-exempt bonds is viewed as an on/off switch for
retail investors. When yields fall below 5%, we believe investors are much less
interested in buying. Since May, the yields have declined from just above 5% to
close the fiscal year at about 4.60%.

Finally, just as it did in fiscal year 2004, credit performed well as spreads
continued to compress. For intermediate and long-term tax-exempt bonds, the
yield offered to "buy" credit, as defined by the spreads between AAA and
BBB-rated securities, narrowed by nearly 25 basis points. This narrowing spread
helped A and BBB-rated sectors outperform the higher rated AA and AAA rated
sectors during the year. Over the last five years, there is very little
difference between the returns in the various rating categories, as the period
three and four years ago was difficult for states and municipalities (recall all
the fiscal stress and budget shortfalls), which caused their credit spreads to
widen.

MINNESOTA MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS I, II, AND III
Q: WHAT CONDITIONS PREVAILED IN THE MINNESOTA DEBT MARKET?
A: Consistent with activity the previous year, the Minnesota tax-exempt debt
market mirrored the national markets. Yields on long-term, high-grade Minnesota
bonds were virtually unchanged in the fiscal year, only moving three basis
points from 4.57% on March 31, 2004 to 4.60% on March 31, 2005 (source:
Municipal Marketing Data [Thompson]). During the 12 months ending March 31,
2005, the Minnesota portion of the Lehman Municipal Bond Index generated a 2.36%
total return, 31 basis points below the 2.67% total return of the overall index.
Fully half of that difference is due to the influence of California bonds on the
overall index. Since a state fiscal crisis in 2003, California bonds have come
off their depressed levels, tightened to the general market and posted
significantly higher returns. Over the last 12 months, the Lehman Municipal Bond
Index, excluding California, would have returned 2.51%.

The supply of new issues decreased nationally during 2004, while new issuance in
Minnesota held steady. Nationally, the supply was down 6.6%, but still
represented the third most active year in history, exceeded only by 2003 and
2002. During the same time period, Minnesota experienced a modest 2% increase
over 2003's new issuance. Some of the decline in issuance nationally was erased
in the first quarter of 2005, when the total volume of new issues set a record
in the first quarter, with more than $96 billion brought to market. In
Minnesota, issuance was up by over 38% from the volume in the first quarter of
last year.

Minnesota's fiscal condition improved during the year, with revenues increasing
by over 5.1% in fiscal 2004. Employment expanded at a 1.4% clip over the last
year, with manufacturing bucking the national downward trend and growing at an
even better 2.2% pace. Unemployment at fiscal year end stood at 4.2%, below the
national rate of 5.4%. Expectations of a budget shortfall continue to ratchet
down as the Legislature is in the midst of its biennial budget process. As part
of that process, the governor has proposed cutbacks in the eligibility for
Medicare, attempting to rein in the spending within the health and human
services area from its current 18% growth rate.

Recognizing the strong performance by the state, Standard & Poor's upgraded
Minnesota's school enhancement program bonds from AA+ to AAA, impacting about
$1.5 billion of school district bond issues, in the third quarter of 2004. A
positive change in statutory requirements for debt service reserves resulted in
Moody's upgrading general obligation ratings of numerous Minnesota cities and
counties. During calendar year 2004, the rating agencies upgrade-to-downgrade
ratio for Minnesota was over 20 to 1, with many of the upgrades for general
obligation bonds issued by counties, cities, and school districts.

Q: AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, HOW DID THE FUNDS PERFORM?
A: For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the Delaware Investments Minnesota
Municipal Income Funds I, II, & III returned 2.87%, 4.03%, and 3.03%* (all
returns reflect shares at net asset value with distributions reinvested),
respectively, while the Lipper Minnesota Municipal Debt Funds universe average
returned 3.62%, and the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index returned 2.67%
during the same period. The Funds' dividends from net investment income during
the past 12 months were exempt from federal income and Minnesota State personal
income taxes.

Q: WHAT STRATEGIES AFFECTED FUND PERFORMANCE?
A: The Funds hold a fair amount of seasoned, higher coupon bonds that trade
based on their short call dates (the date at which the issuer may call the bond
at par from investors). As portfolio managers, we must decide whether to sell
these bonds early, forfeit the higher coupon, and realize a capital gain in
order to seek better price performance. We did not believe the low-interest-rate
environment and the commencing of the Fed tightening cycle was the proper time
to sell early, and therefore, opted to allow our positions to roll down the
yield curve. By rolling down the yield curve, we allowed them to be called or
mature. This afforded us the opportunity to collect high coupon income as long
as possible, while minimizing realized capital gains in the portfolios. However,
these shorter bonds did impede price performance when yields declined in the
second half of 2004.

Normally, when the Fed begins to raise the fed funds rate, longer-term rates
begin to rise in tandem. However, this tightening cycle was unusual in the fact
that long-term rates actually declined. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
called this phenomenon a "conundrum" in recent testimony to Congress. Therefore,
as the bonds did roll off, we chose to invest the proceeds in premium bonds that
should act more defensively in a rising-rate environment. That rising-rate
environment was slow to develop in 2004, but rates have ended the first quarter
higher than calendar year-end.

*Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and a portion of the
income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.

                                       2
<PAGE>
Over the last two years, lower-rated bonds outperformed higher quality bonds.
For instance, over the last 12 months, in the Lehman Municipal Bond Index,
triple-A rated bonds returned 1.88%, while single-A bonds returned 3.41%, and
triple-B bonds returned 8.56%. Within the Minnesota Municipal Income Funds, Fund
II had a lower weighting in triple-A rated bonds than its counterparts.
Conversely, it had a higher weighting in lower-rated bonds, and thus superior
return.

Other key contributors to return in the Funds have been the hospital sector and
IDR/PCR sector, which includes corporate bonds. Our funds have always had a
strong commitment to the hospital sector, which over the trailing 12 months has
had the second highest sector return (+5.44%) in the Lehman index.
We have a smaller commitment to the corporate sector, but do favor certain
industrial development projects secured by companies, such as Potlatch and
International Paper. These securities have performed well for the funds.

Q: WHAT WAS YOUR STRATEGY IN MANAGING THE MINNESOTA FUNDS?
A: With interest rates at historically low levels throughout the period, we
anticipated an eventual rise in rates and continued to position the three
portfolios for such a scenario. Specifically, we kept the Funds' durations
relatively modest to make the portfolios less vulnerable in the event rates
increase (duration is a common measure of a bond or bond fund's sensitivity to
interest rate changes. The longer the duration, the more sensitive the bond or
bond fund is to changes in interest rates). The Funds' durations did naturally
lengthen throughout the past 12 months as bonds matured from the portfolios and
we were forced to reinvest the proceeds at lower prevailing yields. This
activity was manageable throughout the period, however, and as of March 31,
2005, we believed the Fund was well-positioned for the higher interest rates.

When making new investments, we continued to emphasize public-power revenue
bonds, which at period end made up 30.7%, 11.9%, and 21.8% of portfolio assets
in Minnesota Municipal Income Funds I, II, and III, respectively. Our focus was
on basic utilities, which provide essential services such as electric
generation, transmission, and distribution. Unlike their investor-owned
counterparts, the regulated utilities we favored provided relatively stable
revenue streams. We also liked that most bonds in this area are insured, giving
the Funds an extra layer of security. Because there was a healthy supply of
public power bonds during the period, we were able to add to our position in
this sector.

We also favored the hospital sector during the period. Following a number of
credit problems in the late 1990s and early 2000s, most hospitals have had
improvements in their financial strength. Despite these improvements, we believe
many hospital bonds are still trading at somewhat depressed levels, given the
steady credit improvements made. Through careful research, we have sought to
identify attractive value opportunities that we believe can offer higher yields
with only a modest amount of additional risk. By contrast, continuing care
retirement community (CCRC) bonds represented one area of the market that we
de-emphasized. We had concerns about the issuers' ability to meet lofty
occupancy-rate targets at these care facilities for seniors.

ARIZONA MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND

Q: WHAT CONDITIONS PREVAILED IN THE ARIZONA DEBT MARKET?
A: While the Arizona tax-exempt debt markets mirrored the national markets,
certain aspects of the municipal market within Arizona resulted in the state's
municipal bond market underperforming national averages. During the 12 months
ending March 31, 2005, the Arizona portion of the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index generated a 1.97% total return, 70 basis points below the 2.67% total
return of the overall Lehman index. Nationally, most bond issues come to market
with long-term bonds (typically due in 25 and 30 years) as part of the issue
structure. Within Arizona, a large percentage of the issuance comes with maximum
maturities of 20 years. As a result, the average maturity of the Arizona portion
of the index is approximately 1.5 years less than the overall index.

*Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and a portion of the
income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.

                                       3
<PAGE>
These short maturities in Arizona are important to note because the best
performing maturities within the tax-exempt market over the last 12 months have
been long bonds. As mentioned, the overall index had a total return of 2.67%
during the period. That compares with the Lehman Brothers Long Bond Index (bonds
over 22 years to maturity) return of 5.46% during the same time period. It is
easy to see why Arizona lagged behind the national market in such an
environment.

During the calendar year 2004, supply of new issues decreased nationally, but
was higher in Arizona. Nationally, the supply was down 6.6%, but still
represented the third most active year in history, exceeded only by 2003 and
2002. Arizona's new issuance rose by 15% for the year. These roles reversed in
the first quarter of 2005, with national supply setting a record and Arizona
experiencing a particularly dry period. The total volume of new issues set a
record for issuance in the first quarter, with more than $96 billion brought to
market. In Arizona, the issuance was down by over 40% from last year's levels.

Arizona's fiscal condition improved during the year, with revenues increasing by
more than 10% in fiscal 2004 and accelerated to 14% growth in the first quarter
of fiscal year 2005. Growth was driven by both the strong economic environment
and tax increases. Employment continues to expand at a rapid pace within the
state, with unemployment falling over the last 12 months from 5.3% to 4.4%. One
of the strongest areas of expansion is construction, with employment growth
surging 8.8% over the fiscal year. Overall, this growth has enabled the state to
generate a healthy balance in its general fund of 4% at the end of fiscal 2004.

The growth is not limited to the state. Pima County had its general obligation
rating raised by Standard & Poor's from A+ to AA- in the second quarter of 2004.
The rating agency noted the expansion of the county's tax base as a driver of
the higher rating.

Q: AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM?
A: For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the Delaware Investments Arizona
Municipal Income Fund returned 3.34%* (shares at net asset value with
distributions reinvested), underperforming the Lipper Other States Municipal
Debt Funds Average of 3.73%, but outperforming the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index return of 2.67% during the same period. The Fund's dividends from net
income during the past 12 months were exempt from federal income and Arizona
State personal income taxes.

Q: WHAT STRATEGIES AFFECTED FUND PERFORMANCE?
A: The Fund underperformed its Lipper peer group for two primary reasons - calls
of high coupon housing bonds and a heavy weighting in pre-refunded bonds. As the
portfolio has seasoned, several of its positions in housing bonds, both multi-
and single-family structures, were getting into the range where calls (the
issuer redeeming the bonds at 100 or a slight premium prior to final maturity)
were beginning to make economic sense for the issuer. In this most recent fiscal
year, many of these issues were called. Our exposure to the housing sectors
decreased during the year from 7.09% at the beginning to 5.8% as of March 31,
2005. The combined housing bond sectors generated a below-average return of
about 1.30% during the year. While this is low, it is important to recognize the
defensive nature of these bonds, with little price performance opportunities, up
or down.

Another factor affecting fund performance has been an overweighting in
pre-refunded bonds. Pre-refunded bonds are seasoned, higher coupon bonds that
trade to short calls. While they produce above-average income, their short
duration impedes price performance. As portfolio managers, we must decide
whether to sell these bonds early, forfeit the higher coupon, and realize a
capital gain in order to seek better price performance. We did not believe the
low interest rate environment and the commencing of the Fed tightening cycle was
the proper time to execute this strategy. Normally, when the Fed begins to raise
the fed funds rate, longer-term rates begin to rise in tandem. However, this
tightening cycle was unusual in the fact that long-term rates actually declined.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called this a "conundrum" in recent
testimony to Congress.

One of the strategies that paid off during the year was an investment in mid-
and low-investment-grade bonds (A- and BBB-rated). Lower grade bonds have
performed well, and we have invested approximately 5.9% of the assets in
low-investment-grade issues, which generated a 5.56% total return over the last
12 months. It is important to note that the Fund has no exposure to
below-investment-grade issues.

*Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and a portion of the
income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.

                                       4
<PAGE>
In addition, we reinvested maturity and called bond proceeds in some longer-term
securities, which happened to be our best performers in the 12-month trailing
period. However, that did not represent a large enough portion of the portfolio
to have a significant impact on the Fund's return. Since Greenspan's testimony,
longer rates have now begun to rise.

FLORIDA INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND

Q: WHAT CONDITIONS PREVAILED IN THE FLORIDA DEBT MARKET?
A: Consistent with activity the previous year, the Florida tax-exempt debt
markets mirrored the national markets. Yields on long-term high-grade Florida
bonds were virtually unchanged in the fiscal year, only moving one basis point
from a 4.65% on March 31, 2004 to 4.64% on March 31, 2005 (source: Municipal
Marketing Data [Thompson]). During the 12 months ending March 31, 2005, the
Florida portion of the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index slightly
outperformed the overall index.

The supply of new issues decreased both nationally and in the state during
calendar year 2004. Nationally, the supply was down 6.6%, but still represented
the third most active year in history, exceeded only by 2003 and 2002. Florida's
new issuance was down dramatically, falling by nearly 40% for the year. Some of
the decline, nationally and specifically within Florida, was erased in the first
quarter of 2005. In fact, the total volume of new issues set a record for
issuance in the first quarter with more than $96 billion brought to market. In
Florida, issuance was up by more than 67% from the depressed levels of last
year.

Florida's fiscal condition improved during the year, with revenues increasing
9.1% in fiscal 2004 and accelerated with 12.7% growth the first quarter of
fiscal 2005. Employment continues to expand at a rapid pace within the state. It
rose while the rest of the nation lost jobs. As a result, unemployment was down
to 4.5% in February 2005. This has enabled state finances to remain strong and
the state benefited by generating the highest general fund balance of any state,
standing at $5.0 billion.

This strong performance by the state was recognized by the ratings agencies, and
both Moody's and Standard & Poor's rewarded Florida by upgrading its general
obligation bonds (to Aa1 and AAA, respectively) in the first quarter of 2005.

In his fiscal 2005-06 budget proposal, the governor has included a two-year
phase out of the state's Intangibles Tax. This tax was reduced in 1999 with an
intention of phasing it out, but the budget squeeze in the early 2000's forced
the state to keep the tax as an important revenue source. Elimination of the
state's intangibles tax would cost Florida approximately $300 million per year
in lost revenues. We are closely monitoring the situation.

Q: AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM?
A: For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the Delaware Investments Florida
Insured Municipal Income Fund returned 1.59%* (shares at net asset value with
distributions reinvested), underperforming both the Lipper Florida Municipal
Debt Funds Universe average of 3.72% and the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index return of 2.67% during the same period. The Fund's dividends from net
investment income during the past 12 months were exempt from federal income and
Florida tangible personal property taxes.

Q: WHAT STRATEGIES AFFECTED FUND PERFORMANCE?
A: The Fund underperformed its Lipper peer group and the Lehman Index primarily
due to the nature of the Fund being largely a triple-A insured fund. Over the
last two years, triple-A bonds have underperformed lower-rated securities. For
instance, over this 12-month period, in the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index, triple-A rated bonds returned 1.88%, while single-A bonds returned 3.41%,
and triple-B bonds returned 8.56%. Although we cannot change the insured mandate
of the Fund, we can state that we have found, over time, that these
discrepancies revert to the mean. For instance, over a five-year cumulative
period, the triple-A sector return for the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index
was 34%, while the single-A sector return was 32%, and the triple-B sector was
39%.

*Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and a portion of the
income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.

Another factor affecting performance of the Fund has been an overweighting in
pre-refunded bonds. Pre-refunded bonds are seasoned, higher coupon bonds that
trade to short calls. While they produce above average income, their short
duration impedes price performance. As portfolio managers, we must decide
whether to sell these bonds early, forfeit the higher coupon, and realize a
capital gain in order to seek better price performance. We did not believe the
low-interest-rate environment and the commencing of the Fed tightening cycle was
the proper time to execute this strategy. Normally, when the Fed begins to raise
the fed funds rate, longer-term rates begin to rise in tandem. However, this
tightening cycle was unusual in that long-term rates actually declined. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called this phenomenon a "conundrum" in recent
testimony to Congress.

We did, however, reinvest maturity and called bond proceeds in some longer-term
securities, which happened to be our best performers in the 12-month trailing
period. However, this did not represent a large enough portion of the portfolio
to have a significant impact on the Fund's return. Since Greenspan's testimony,
longer rates have now begun to rise.

COLORADO INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND

Q: WHAT CONDITIONS PREVAILED IN THE COLORADO DEBT MARKET?
A: After underperforming the general market substantially in the previous fiscal
year, the Colorado municipal market generated total returns that were close to
market levels. During the 12 months ending March 31, 2005, the Colorado portion
of the Lehman Index generated a 2.37% total return, 30 basis points below the
2.67% total return of the overall Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index. Fully
half of that difference is due to the influence of California bonds in the
overall index. Since its fiscal crisis in 2003, California bonds have come off
their depressed levels, tightened to the general market, and posted
significantly higher returns. In fact, over the last 12 months, the Lehman
index, excluding California, would have returned 2.51%.

During calendar year 2004, supply of new issues decreased nationally, but was
higher in Colorado. Nationally, the supply was down 6.6%, but still represented
the third most active year in history, exceeded only by 2003 and 2002.
Colorado's new issuance rose by 22% for the year. These roles reversed in first
quarter 2005, with national supply setting a record and Colorado experiencing a
particularly dry period. The total volume of new issues set a record for
issuance in the first quarter, with more than $96 billion brought to market. In
Colorado, the issuance was down by more than 20% from last year's levels.

Colorado is rebounding from the severe economic downturn it experienced at the
beginning of the decade due to the decline in telecommunications and technology.
State revenues increased 5.1% in fiscal 2004 after declining 5.1% in fiscal
2003. Revenue growth accelerated into this fiscal year, increasing 6.5% in the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. The state is starting to rebuild its general fund
balance, with a fiscal 2004-ending balance equaling about 3.9% of expenditures.
Unemployment has declined over the last year from 5.8% to 4.9%. The bond market
will be closely monitoring the budgeting process as the Governor has proposed an
$850 million tobacco settlement bond issue, part of the proceeds to go to
operating income and part to help create a "rainy day" fund.

Growth is not limited to state government. While there were not any significant
ratings changes within Colorado during the fiscal year, Moody's upgraded the
general obligation ratings of several school districts' bonds. In most of these
upgrades, the ratings agency noted the expansion of the tax base as one of the
drivers of the higher ratings.

Q: AGAINST THIS BACKDROP, HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM?
A: For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, the Delaware Investments Colorado
Insured Municipal Income Fund returned 2.56%* (shares at net asset value with
distributions reinvested), underperforming the Lipper Other States Municipal
Debt Funds Universe average of 3.73% and the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index return of 2.67% during this period. The Fund's dividends from net
investment income during the past 12 months were exempt from federal income and
Colorado State personal income taxes.

*Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and a portion of the
income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.

the mean. For instance, over a cumulative five-year period, the triple-A sector
return for the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index was 34%, while the single-A
sector return was 32%, and the triple-B sector 39%.

Another factor affecting performance has been an overweighting in bonds with
medium durations. Due to the seasoning of the portfolio, many bonds that were
originally purchased with 10-year call protection are now being priced based on
shorter calls that are now in the three- to seven-year range. The three- and
five-year portions of the Lehman index only returned 0.09% and 0.26% over the
period, the worst of any maturities. Longer bonds, with more than 22 years to
maturity, were the best-performing sector, with a 5.46% total return over the
fiscal year.

Seasoned bonds generally are higher coupon bonds that were purchased in a higher
yield environment. While they produce above-average income, their short duration
can impede price performance. As portfolio managers, we must decide whether to
sell these bonds early, forfeit the higher coupon, and realize a capital gain in
order to seek better price performance. We did not believe the low interest rate

trailing period. However, that did not represent a large enough portion of the
portfolio to have a significant impact on the Fund's return. Since Greenspan's
testimony, longer rates have now begun to rise. Currently, we are maintaining a
modestly defensive position, holding a duration (a measure of the portfolio's
sensitivity to interest rate changes) of 4.8 years, below that of both its
Lipper peer group (5.5 year average) and the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index (5.45 years).

*Past performance is not a guarantee of future results and a portion of the
income from tax-exempt funds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
    this change for the year ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
    investment income per share of $0.006, a decrease in net realized and
    unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.006, and an increase in the ratio of
    net investment income to average net assets of 0.04%. Per share data and
    ratios for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect
    this change in accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
    this change for the year ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
    investment income per share of $0.007, a decrease in net realized and
    unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.007, and an increase in the ratio of
    net investment income to average net assets of 0.04%. Per share data and
    ratios for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect
    this change in accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. This change
    in accounting had no effect on the Fund's results of operations for the year
    ended March 31, 2002. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior to
    April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the

NOTES                       DELAWARE INVESTMENTS CLOSED-END MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     March 31, 2005

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal
Fund"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc.
("Minnesota Municipal Fund II"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income
Fund III, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund III"); Delaware Investments Arizona
Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Arizona Municipal Fund"); and Delaware Investments
Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Colorado Insured Municipal Fund")
are organized as Minnesota corporations and Delaware Investments Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund ("Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund") is organized as
a Massachusetts Business Trust (each referred to as a "Fund" and collectively as
the "Funds"). The Minnesota Municipal Fund II, Florida Insured Municipal Fund
and Arizona Municipal Fund are diversified closed-end management investment
companies and Minnesota Municipal Fund, Minnesota Municipal Fund III and
Colorado Insured Municipal Fund are non-diversified closed-end management
investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Funds' shares trade on the American Stock Exchange.

The investment objective of each Fund is to provide high current income exempt
from federal income tax and from the personal income tax of its state, if any,
consistent with the preservation of capital. Florida Insured Municipal Fund will
generally seek investments that will enable its shares to be exempt from
Florida's intangible personal property tax. Each Fund will seek to achieve its
investment objective by investing substantially all of its net assets in
investment grade, tax-exempt municipal obligations of its respective state.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and are consistently followed by the Funds.

Security Valuation -- Long-term debt securities are valued by an independent
pricing service and such prices are believed to reflect the fair value of such
securities. Short-term debt securities having less than 60 days to maturity are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other securities and
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under the direction of the Funds' Board of
Trustees/Directors.

Federal Income Taxes -- Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal
income tax purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite
distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the financial statements.

Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Other -- Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments Family of
Funds are allocated amongst the Funds on the basis of average net assets.
Management fees and some other expenses are paid monthly. Security transactions
are recorded on the date the securities are purchased or sold (trade date).
Costs used in calculating realized gains and losses on the sale of investment
securities are those of the specific securities sold. Interest income is
recorded on the accrual basis. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest
income over the lives of the respective securities. Each Fund declares and pays
dividends from net investment income monthly and distributions from net realized
gain on investments, if any, annually. In addition, in order to satisfy certain
distribution requirements of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Funds may declare
special year-end dividend and capital gains distributions during November or
December to shareholders of record on a date in such month. Such distributions,
if received by shareholders by January 31, are deemed to have been paid by the
Funds and received by shareholders on the earlier of the date paid or December
31 of the prior year.

Expenses Paid Indirectly -- The Funds receive earnings credits from their
custodian when positive cash balances are maintained, which are used to offset
custody fees. The expense paid under the above arrangement is included in
custodian fees on the Statements of Operations with the corresponding expense
offset shown as expenses paid indirectly. The amount of the expense for each
Fund for the year ended March 31, 2005 was as follows:

2. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
   AFFILIATES
In accordance with the terms of its respective investment management agreement,
each Fund pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware
Management Business Trust and the investment manager, an annual fee of 0.40%
which is calculated daily based on the average daily net assets of each Fund,
including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be outstanding.

As of September 1, 2004, DMC has voluntarily agreed to waive that portion, if
any, of its management fee and reimburse the Minnesota Municipal Fund to the
extent necessary to ensure that annual operating expenses, exclusive of taxes,
interest, brokerage commissions, remarketing and rating agency fees, certain
insurance costs and extraordinary expenses, do not exceed 0.72% of average daily
net assets of the Fund, including assets attributable to any preferred stock
that may be outstanding, through September 30, 2005. This waiver may be revoked
at any time.

The Funds have engaged Delaware Service Company, Inc., (DSC), an affiliate of
DMC, to provide accounting and administration services which are based on
average net assets and paid on a monthly basis, subject to certain minimums.

For financial reporting purposes, capital accounts are adjusted to reflect the
tax character of permanent book/tax differences. For the year ended March 31,
2005, the Funds recorded the following reclassifications. Reclassifications are
primarily due to tax treatment of market discounts on certain debt instruments
and the expiration of capital loss carryforwards. Results of operations and net
assets were not affected by these reclassifications.

rate established at the initial public offering and are typically reset every 28
days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates (adjusted for any
capital gain distributions) ranged during the year ended March 31, 2005 as

Under the 1940 Act, the Funds may not declare dividends or make other
distributions on common shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of
the declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the
outstanding preferred stock is less than 200%. The preferred shares are
redeemable at the option of the Funds, in whole or in part, on any dividend
payment date at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared. The preferred shares are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of each Fund are not satisfied. The holders of
preferred shares have voting rights equal to the holders of common shares (one
vote per share) and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single
class. However, holders of preferred shares are also entitled to elect two of
each Fund's Directors. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that along with
approval by shareholders that might otherwise be required, the approval of the
holders of a majority of any outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as
a class, would be required to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would
adversely affect the preferred shares, and (b) take any action requiring a vote
of security holders pursuant of Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act, including, among
other things, changes in each of the Fund's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in their fundamental investment restrictions.

NOTES                       DELAWARE INVESTMENTS CLOSED-END MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS
  TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

6. CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS
The Funds concentrate their investments in securities issued by municipalities.
The value of these investments may be adversely affected by new legislation
within the states, regional or local economic conditions, and differing levels
of supply and demand for municipal bonds. Many municipalities insure repayment
for their obligations. Although bond insurance reduces the risk of loss due to
default by an issuer, such bonds remain subject to the risk that market value
may fluctuate for other reasons and there is no assurance that the insurance
company will meet its obligations. These securities have been identified in the
Statements of Net Assets.

The Funds may invest in inverse floating rate securities ("inverse floaters"), a
type of derivative tax-exempt obligation with floating or variable interest
rates that move in the opposite direction of short-term interest rates, usually
at an accelerated speed. Consequently, the market values of inverse floaters
will generally be more volatile than other tax-exempt investments. Such
securities are denoted on the Statements of Net Assets.

The Funds may invest in advanced refunded bonds, escrow secured bonds or
defeased bonds. Under current federal tax laws and regulations, state and local
government borrowers are permitted to refinance outstanding bonds by issuing new
bonds. The issuer refinances the outstanding debt to either reduce interest
costs or to remove or alter restrictive covenants imposed by the bonds being
refinanced. A refunding transaction where the municipal securities are being
refunded within 90 days or less from the issuance of the refunding issue is
known as a "current refunding". "Advance refunded bonds" are bonds in which the
refunded bond issue remains outstanding for more than 90 days following the
issuance of the refunding issue. In an advance refunding, the issuer will use
the proceeds of a new bond issue to purchase high grade interest bearing debt
securities which are then deposited in an irrevocable escrow account held by an
escrow agent to secure all future payments of principal and interest and bond
premium of the advance refunded bond. Bonds are "escrowed to maturity" when the
proceeds of the refunding issue are deposited in an escrow account for
investment sufficient to pay all of the principal and interest on the original
interest payment and maturity dates. Bonds are considered "pre-refunded" when
the refunding issue's proceeds are escrowed only until a permitted call date or
dates on the refunded issue with the refunded issue being redeemed at that time,
including any required premium. Bonds become "defeased" when the rights and
interests of the bondholders and their lien on the pledged revenues or other
security under the terms of the bond contract are substituted with an
alternative source of revenues (the escrow securities) sufficient to meet
payments of principal and interest to maturity or to the first call dates.
Escrowed secured bonds will often receive a rating of AAA from Moody's, S&P,
and/or Fitch due to the strong credit quality of the escrow securities and the
irrevocable nature of the escrow deposit agreement.

Each Fund may invest up to 15% of its net assets in illiquid securities, which
may include securities with contractual restrictions on resale, securities
exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and other securities which may not be readily marketable. The relative
illiquidity of these securities may impair the Fund from disposing of them in a
timely manner and at a fair price when it is necessary or desirable to do so.
Such securities are denoted on the Statements of Net Assets.

7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The Funds enter into contracts in the normal course of business that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Funds' maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts. Management has reviewed the Funds' existing
contracts and and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

8. TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
The information set forth is for each Fund's fiscal year end as required by
federal laws. Shareholders, however, must report distributions on a calendar
year basis for income tax purposes, which may include distributions for portions
of two fiscal years of a fund. Accordingly, the information needed by
shareholders for income tax purposes will be sent to them in January of each
year. Please consult your tax advisor for proper treatment of this information.

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005, each Fund designates distributions
paid during the year as follows:

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc.
Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, Inc.
Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Inc.
Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund
Delaware Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets of Delaware
Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, Inc., Delaware Investments
Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc., Delaware Investments Minnesota
Municipal Income Fund III, Inc., Delaware Investments Arizona Municipal Income
Fund, Inc., Delaware Investments Florida Insured Municipal Income Fund and
Delaware Investments Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("the Funds"),
as of March 31, 2005, and the related statements of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of March 31, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
respective Funds at March 31, 2005, the results of their operations for the year
then ended, the changes in their net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and their financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Item 5.  Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

         The registrant has a separately-designated standing Audit Committee
established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The members of the registrant's Audit Committee are Thomas L.
Bennett, Thomas F. Madison, Janet L. Yeomans and J. Richard Zecher.

Item 6.  Schedule of Investments

         Included as part of report to shareholders filed under Item 1 of this
Form N-CSR.

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies

         The registrant has formally delegated to its investment adviser(s)
(including any sub-adviser) (the "Adviser") the ability to make all proxy voting
decisions in relation to portfolio securities held by the registrant. If and
when proxies need to be voted on behalf of the registrant, the Adviser will vote
such proxies pursuant to its Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures (the
"Procedures"). The Adviser has established a Proxy Voting Committee (the
"Committee") which is responsible for overseeing the Adviser's proxy voting
process for the registrant. One of the main responsibilities of the Committee is
to review and approve the Procedures to ensure that the Procedures are designed
to allow the Adviser to vote proxies in a manner consistent with the goal of
voting in the best interests of the registrant.

         In order to facilitate the actual process of voting proxies, the
Adviser has contracted with Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") to
analyze proxy statements on behalf of the registrant and other Adviser clients
and vote proxies generally in accordance with the Procedures. The Committee is
responsible for overseeing ISS's proxy voting activities. If a proxy has been
voted for the registrant, ISS will create a record of the vote. Information (if
any) regarding how the registrant voted proxies relating to portfolio securities
during the most recent 12-month period ended June 30 is available without charge
(i) through the registrant's website at http://www.delawareinvestments.com; and
(ii) on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

         The Procedures contain a general guideline that recommendations of
company management on an issue (particularly routine issues) should be given a
fair amount of weight in determining how proxy issues should be voted. However,
the Adviser will normally vote against management's position when it runs
counter to its specific Proxy Voting Guidelines (the "Guidelines"), and the
Adviser will also vote against management's recommendation when it believes that
such position is not in the best interests of the registrant.

<PAGE>

         As stated above, the Procedures also list specific Guidelines on how to
vote proxies on behalf of the registrant. Some examples of the Guidelines are as
follows: (i) generally vote for shareholder proposals asking that a majority or
more of directors be independent; (ii) generally vote against proposals to
require a supermajority shareholder vote; (iii) votes on mergers and
acquisitions should be considered on a case-by-case basis, determining whether
the transaction enhances shareholder value; (iv) generally vote against
proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior voting rights; (v)
generally vote re-incorporation proposals on a case-by-case basis; (vi) votes
with respect to management compensation plans are generally determined on a
case-by-case basis; (vii) generally vote for reports on the level of greenhouse
gas emissions from a company's operations and products; and (viii) generally
vote for proposals requesting the company to report on its policies and
practices related to social, environmental and economic sustainability.

         Because the registrant has delegated proxy voting to the Adviser, the
registrant is not expected to encounter any conflict of interest issues
regarding proxy voting and therefore does not have procedures regarding this
matter. However, the Adviser does have a section in its Procedures that
addresses the possibility of conflicts of interest. Most proxies which the
Adviser receives on behalf of the registrant are voted by ISS in accordance with
the Procedures. Because almost all registrant proxies are voted by ISS pursuant
to the pre-determined Procedures, it normally will not be necessary for the
Adviser to make an actual determination of how to vote a particular proxy,
thereby largely eliminating conflicts of interest for the Adviser during the
proxy voting process. In the very limited instances where the Adviser is
considering voting a proxy contrary to ISS's recommendation, the Committee will
first assess the issue to see if there is any possible conflict of interest
involving the Adviser or affiliated persons of the Adviser. If a member of the
Committee has actual knowledge of a conflict of interest, the Committee will
normally use another independent third party to do additional research on the
particular proxy issue in order to make a recommendation to the Committee on how
to vote the proxy in the best interests of the registrant. The Committee will
then review the proxy voting materials and recommendation provided by ISS and
the independent third party to determine how to vote the issue in a manner which
the Committee believes is consistent with the Procedures and in the best
interests of the registrant.
