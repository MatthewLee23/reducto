The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging through borrowings or
issuance of short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept
of leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained
from leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets received from
leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater
than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from the
securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's
net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the
amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

A Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder

Financial markets embarked on a wild ride during the August reporting period.
Subprime mortgage troubles intensified in the final months of the period,
spawning a widespread credit and liquidity crisis that crept into other areas of
the market. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) and other countries'
central banks stepped in to inject liquidity into the markets and bolster
investor confidence. In August, the Fed cut the discount rate, the rate charged
to banks to borrow money directly from the Fed, from 6.25% to 5.75%. Another50%
cut in the discount rate came on September 18, along with a50% cut in the more
widely followed federal funds rate. This brought the target short-term interest
rate, which had remained unchanged at 5.25% for over a year, to 4.75%.

Although heightened volatility has been a recurring theme throughout the past
year, the global economy (excluding the U.S. housing market) remained quite
healthy. In general, equity market fundamentals also held firm -- second-quarter
corporate earnings exceeded expectations (although future earnings could be at
risk if the economy weakens), dividend payouts and share buybacks continued to
grow, and valuations remained attractive. These tailwinds generally prevailed
over such headwinds as a slowing U.S. economy and troubled housing market,
although the more recent credit crunch dampened corporate merger-and-acquisition
activity, a key source of strength for equity markets. Stocks recorded their
second-worst day of the year in August, yet remained comfortably in the black
year-to-date.

Meanwhile, mixed economic signals and the credit market debacle made for a
volatile backdrop for fixed income, with investors fleeing from bonds associated
with the housing and credit markets in favor of higher-quality Treasury issues.
As a result, the 10-year Treasury yield, which touched 5.30% in June ( its
highest level in five years), fell to 4.54% by period-end, while prices
correspondingly rose.

Against this backdrop, financial markets posted mixed results for the six- and
12-month periods ended August 31, 2007:

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end
management investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may require
the use of management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from
these estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments,
which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement
of the results for the interim period. All such adjustments are of a normal,
recurring nature. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the
net asset value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock
shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations -- The Fund invests principally in debt
obligations of companies, including floating rate loans made by banks and other
financial institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds
and notes. The Fund's investments in loan participation interests involve the
risk of insolvency of the financial intermediaries who are parties to the
transactions.

(b) Valuation of investments -- Floating rate loans are valued in accordance
with guidelines established by the Fund's Board of Directors. Floating rate loan
interests are valued at the mean between the last available bid prices from one
or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the
limited number of floating rate loans for which no reliable price quotes are
available, such floating rate loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
through the use of pricing matrixes to determine valuations. If the pricing
service does not provide a value for floating rate loans, BlackRock Advisors,
LLC (the "Manager"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc.,
will value the floating rate loans at fair value, which is intended to
approximate market value.

Debt securities are traded primarily in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market and
are valued at the last available bid price in the OTC market or on the basis of
values obtained by a pricing service. Pricing services use valuation matrixes
that incorporate both dealer-supplied valuations and valuation models. The
procedures of the pricing service and its valuations are reviewed by the
officers of the Fund under the general direction of the Board of Directors. Such
valuations and procedures will be reviewed periodically by the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

Securities held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the NASDAQ
Global Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price on the
exchange on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business on the
day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last available
bid price for long positions, and at the last available asked price for short
positions. In cases where securities are traded on more than one exchange, the
securities are valued on the exchange designated as the primary market by or
under the authority of the Board of Directors of the Fund. Long positions in
securities traded in the OTC market, NASDAQ Capital Market or Bulletin Board are
valued at the last available bid price or yield equivalent obtained from one or
more dealers or pricing services approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund.
Short positions in securities traded in the OTC market are valued at the last
available asked price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in the OTC
market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and most
representative market. When the Fund writes an option, the amount of the premium
received is recorded on the books of the Fund as an asset and an equivalent
liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently valued to reflect the
current market value of the option written, based on the last sale price in the
case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded in the OTC
market, the last asked price. Options purchased by the Fund are valued at their
last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of
options traded in the OTC market, the last bid price. Swap agreements are valued
based upon quoted fair valuations received daily by the Fund from a pricing
service or counterparty. Other investments, including futures contracts and
related options, are stated at market value. Obligations with remaining
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost unless the Manager
believes that this method no longer produces fair valuations. Valuation of other
short-term investment vehicles is generally based on the net asset value of the
underlying investment vehicle or amortized cost. Repurchase agreements will be
valued at cost plus accrued interest.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. government securities,
money market instruments and certain fixed income securities, is substantially
completed each day at various times prior to the close of business on the NYSE.
The values of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the
Fund's shares are determined as of such times. Foreign currency exchange rates
will generally be determined as of the close of business on the NYSE.
Occasionally, events affecting the values of such securities and such exchange


18     BLACKROCK DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.     AUGUST 31, 2007

<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

rates may occur between the times at which they are determined and the close of
business on the NYSE that may not be reflected in the computation of the Fund's
net asset value. If events (for example, a company announcement, market
volatility or a natural disaster) occur during such periods that are expected to
materially affect the value of such securities, those securities will be valued
at their fair value as determined in good faith by the Fund's Board of Directors
or by the Manager using a pricing service and/or procedures approved by the
Fund's Board of Directors.

(c) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract. The counterparty for certain
instruments may pledge cash or securities as collateral.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such financial futures contracts.
      Financial futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of
      securities at a specific future date and at a specific price or yield.
      Upon entering into a contract, the Fund deposits, and maintains as
      collateral, such initial margin as required by the exchange on which the
      transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees to
      receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
      fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
      as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or
      losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time
      it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may write covered call and put options and purchase
      call and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
      the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
      equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
      marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
      written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
      option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted
      from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to)
      the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund
      enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on
      the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss
      to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid
      or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are OTC contracts
      in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments
      on a specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set
      period of time or may be triggered by a predetermined credit event. The
      net periodic payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate;
      the change in market value of a specified security, basket of securities,
      or index; or the return generated by a security. These periodic payments
      received or made by the Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of
      Operations as realized gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are
      also realized upon termination of the swap agreements. Swaps are
      marked-to-market daily and changes in value are recorded as unrealized
      appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in the returns of the
      underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to perform under the
      contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with respect to the
      swap agreements.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the
      change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
      loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

(d) Foreign currency transactions -- Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.
The Fund invests in foreign securities, which may involve a number of risk
factors and special considerations not present with investments in securities of
U.S. corporations.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

(e) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

(f) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities. The Fund earns facility and other
fees on loan participation interests. Other fees earned include amendment,
consent and prepayment fees.

(g) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(h) Securities lending -- The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least
100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market value of
the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any
additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business
day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the loaned securities,
it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically receives the income on
the loaned securities but does not receive the income on the collateral. Where
the Fund receives cash collateral, it may invest such collateral and retain the
amount earned on such investment, net of any amount rebated to the borrower.
Loans of securities are terminable at any time and the borrower, after notice,
is required to return borrowed securities within five business days. The Fund
may pay reasonable finder's, lending agent, administrative and custodial fees in
connection with its loans. In the event that the borrower defaults on its
obligation to return borrowed securities because of insolvency or for any other
reason, the Fund could experience delays and costs in gaining access to the
collateral. The Fund also could suffer a loss where the value of the collateral
falls below the market value of the borrowed securities, in the event of
borrower default or in the event of losses on investments made with cash
collateral.

(i) Recent accounting pronouncements -- Effective August 31, 2007, the Fund
implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48,
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition
threshold a tax position must meet in connection with accounting for
uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken by an
entity, including investment companies, before being measured and recognized in
the financial statements. Management has evaluated the application of FIN 48 to
the Fund, and has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 does not have a
material impact on the Fund's financial statements. The Fund files U.S. and
various state tax returns. No income tax returns are currently under
examination. The statute of limitations on the Fund's tax returns remains open
for the years ended February 28, 2004 through February 28, 2007.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair
Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of FAS 157
and its impact on the Fund's financial statements, if any, has not been
determined.

In addition, in February 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities" ("FAS 159"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a
fiscal year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity
also elects to apply the provisions of FAS 157. FAS 159 permits entities to
choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair
value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities. At this time, management is evaluating
the implications of FAS 159 and its impact on the Fund's financial statements,
if any, has not been determined.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Manager.
Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") and The PNC Financial Services
Group, Inc. are principal owners of BlackRock, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

The Manager is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund
pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average daily net
assets plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage. In
addition, the Manager has entered into a Sub-Advisory Agreement with BlackRock
Financial Management, LLC ("BFM"), an affiliate of the Manager, under which the
Manager pays BFM for services it provides a monthly fee at an annual rate that
is a percentage of the management fee paid by the Fund to the Manager.

The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, or its
affiliates. Pursuant to that order, the Fund has retained BlackRock Investment
Management, LLC ("BIM"), an affiliate of the Manager, as the securities lending
agent for a fee based on a share of the returns on investment of cash
collateral. BIM may, on behalf of the Fund, invest cash collateral received by
the Fund for such loans, among other things, in a private investment company
managed by the Manager or in registered money market funds advised by the
Manager or its affiliates.

For the six months ended August 31, 2007, the Fund reimbursed the Manager
$7,641 for certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
BlackRock, Inc. or its affiliates.

3. Investments:

4. Capital Share Transactions:

unissued shares of capital stock without approval of the holders of Common
Stock.

Shares issued and outstanding during the six months ended August 31, 2007 and

6. Short-Term Borrowings:

On May 16, 2007, the Fund renewed its revolving credit and security agreement
funded by a commercial paper asset securitization program with Citicorp North
America, Inc. ("Citicorp") as Agent, certain secondary backstop lenders, and
certain asset securitization conduits as lenders (the "Lenders"). The agreement
was renewed for one year and has a maximum limit of $370,000,000. Under the
Citicorp program, the conduits will fund advances to the Fund through the
issuance of highly rated commercial paper. As security for its obligations to
the Lenders under the revolving securitization facility, the Fund has granted a
security interest in substantially all of its assets to and in favor of the
Lenders. The interest rate on the Fund's borrowings is based on the interest
rate carried by the commercial paper plus a program fee. The Fund pays
additional borrowing costs including a backstop commitment fee.

The weighted average annual interest rate was 5.62% and the average borrowing
was approximately $302,039,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2007.

7. Capital Loss Carryforward:

BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. seeks to provide current income by
investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. companies' debt
instruments, including corporate loans, that are rated in the lower rating
categories of the established rating services (Baa or lower by Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or BBB or lower by Standard & Poor's) or unrated debt instruments
of comparable quality.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to
shareholders of BlackRock Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. for their information. It
is not a prospectus. Past performance results shown in this report should not be
considered a representation of future performance. The Fund leverages its Common
Stock to provide Common Stock shareholders with a potentially higher rate of
return. Leverage creates risk for Common Stock shareholders, including the
likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of Common
Stock shares, and the risk that fluctuations in short-term interest rates may
reduce the Common Stock's yield. Statements and other information herein are as
dated and are subject to change.

to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available (1) without
