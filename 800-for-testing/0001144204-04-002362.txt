The Herzfeld  Caribbean Basin Fund's  investment  objective is long-term capital
appreciation.  To achieve its  objective,  the Fund  invests in issuers that are
likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic,  political,  structural
and  technological  developments in the countries in the Caribbean Basin,  which
consists of Cuba,  Jamaica,  Trinidad  and Tobago,  the Bahamas,  the  Dominican
Republic,  Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras,  Guatemala,  Belize, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia
and  Venezu-ela.  The fund  invests at least 80% of its total  assets in a broad
range of securities of issuers including U.S.-based  companies,  which engage in
substantial  trade with and derive  substantial  revenue from  operations in the
Caribbean Basin Countries.

================================================================================

                                                                  [PHOTO]
                                                            Thomas J. Herzfeld
                                                          Chairman and President

February 2, 2004

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

We are pleased to present our semi-annual  report for the period ending December
31,  2003.  On that date The  Herzfeld  Caribbean  Basin  Fund's net assets were
$8,719,841  and  its per  share  net  asset  value  was  $5.20*,  compared  with
$5,741,830  or $3.42 per share a year earlier  representing  a gain in net asset
value of 52.0% for the  calendar  year and 31.64% for the six month period ended
December 31, 2003.

When we formed The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund 10 years ago, it appeared to us
at the time that the U.S.  may have been  considering  lifting the embargo  with
Cuba. That event, however, has always been elusive.  Knowing that, we positioned
the Fund's  investments  in companies  which we believed  would do well if there
were no change in U.S.  policy  towards Cuba; but at the same time, in companies
we believe  would benefit from the  resumption of trade with that country.  That
strategy has worked quite well. For instance,  our net asset value has reached a
record high  (adjusted  for  distributions)  and our shares have  recently  been
trading  at a  premium  to net  asset  value.  Many of our  major  holdings  are
experiencing good price performance.

Although the embargo with Cuba is still in place, it is interesting to note that
the U.S. is Cuba's 8th largest trading partner.  U.S. food sales to that country
now account for 25% of Cuba's food imports.

The Cuban economy grew at 2.6% in 2003.  Although sugar production  dropped 40%,
tourism  was quite  strong.  Approximately  1.9 million  foreigners  visited the
island, a 16% increase from the previous year.

We continue to believe that our  portfolio  is invested in companies  throughout
the  Caribbean  Basin  which have  great  prospects--with  or without  the Cuban
embargo. If trade is resumed, things should get very interesting.

- --------------------
*For those who like coincidences, 5/20 or May 20th is Cuban Independence Day and
5/20/04 will mark the tenth anniversary of our Fund's trading.

PREMIUM/DISCOUNT

As the graph below  depicts,  the Fund has traded at both premiums and discounts
every year except the year of inception in which it traded only at a premium. As
I have stated before,  we believe that closed-end  funds trading at discounts to
net asset value represent good value.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION AND RELATED MATTERS
- --------------------------------

The Herzfeld  Caribbean  Basin Fund,  Inc.  (the  "Fund") is a  non-diversified,
closed-end  management  investment  company  incorporated  under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January,  1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The  Fund's  investment  policy  is to  invest  at least  80% of its  assets  in
investments that are economically tied to Caribbean Basin Countries.  The Fund's
investment  objective  is to obtain  long-term  capital  appreciation.  The Fund
pursues  its  objective  by  investing  primarily  in equity  and  equity-linked
securities of public and private companies,  including U.S.-based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country  or (ii)  that  have at least  50% of the  value of  their  assets  in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country. The Fund's investment objective is
fundamental  and may not be changed  without  the  approval of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities.

At  December  31,  2003,  the  Fund  had  investments  in  companies   operating
principally in Mexico and the Cayman Islands, representing approximately 11% and
8% of the Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is Investors Bank & Trust Company, based
in Boston, Massachusetts.

SECURITY VALUATION
- ------------------

Investments in securities traded on a national  securities  exchange or reported
on the NASDAQ are stated at the last reported  sales price and official  closing
price,  respectively,  on the day of valuation;  other securities  traded in the
over-the-counter  market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on
that date are stated at the last quoted bid price.  Short-term  notes are stated
at amortized cost, which is equivalent to value. Restricted securities and other
securities  for which  quotations  are not readily  available are valued at fair
value as determined by the Board of Directors.


                                     - 13 -
<PAGE>

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
================================================================================

INCOME RECOGNITION
- ------------------

Security  transactions  are  recorded  on the trade  date.  Gains and  losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost.  Dividend income
is recognized on the  ex-dividend  date, and interest income is recognized on an
accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on securities purchased are amortized over
the life of the respective securities.

DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
- ------------------------------------

The Fund may, during the course of its  operations,  maintain  account  balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -----------------------------------------------------------

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

INCOME TAXES
- ------------

The Fund  qualifies  as a  "regulated  investment  company"  and as such (and by
complying with the applicable  provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended) is not subject to federal  income tax on taxable  income  (including
realized capital gains) that is distributed to shareholders.

The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS
- -----------------------------

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and
capital  gain  distributions  are  determined  in  accordance  with  income  tax
regulations which may differ from accounting  principles  generally  accepted in
the United States of America.

imposed by the New York Stock  Exchange in July,  1995. As of December 31, 2003,
the position was valued at $0 by the Board of Directors,  which approximates the
bonds' fair value.
