CITIGROUP ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE
FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - SERIES G
("MULTI-ADVISER-G" OR THE "PORTFOLIO")
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi-Adviser-G  was up 14.03%  for  calendar  year 2007.  As further  described
below,  please find a summary of results for the Portfolio's hedge fund strategy
groups for the year,  as well as our  outlook  going  forward.

Hedge funds as a group finished the year in line with the  expectations set back
at the end of 2006. Based on the Hedge Fund Research,  Inc. (HFRI) Fund Weighted
Composite Index hedge funds  delivered  returns of 9.97% for 2007, the HFRI Fund
of  Funds  Composite  Index  finished  ahead  by  10.25%.  More  importantly,  a
diversified  portfolio of hedge funds  delivered  this return stream with modest
mid single digit volatility and attractive  correlation  characteristics  versus
the broader  stock and bond market  indices.  Each of these hedge fund  measures
outperformed  the equity and fixed income  markets,  equities as measured by the
S&P 500 were up 5.49% and fixed income  measured by the Lehman  Aggregated  Bond
index finished up 6.96%. The high yield market after advancing in the first half
of the year lost ground as the sub-prime  credit crisis began to spill over into
the corporate  market.  High yield was up 2.09%,  based on the Bear Stearns High
Yield  composite.  The largest  advances  for the year were  experienced  in the
commodity  markets where energy,  metals and many soft commodities moved sharply
higher, the Goldman Sachs Commodity index up 32.67% for the year. In 2008, there
are many obstacles  facing the markets,  which we believe will prove a challenge
for both traditional and hedge fund managers.

While we believe  investing,  whether in  traditional  asset classes or in hedge
funds,  is a continual  process and not one confined to specific blocks of time,
such as a year, the question  remains the same:  "What are the  expectations for
the remainder of the year"? Our current  forward-looking outlook for the returns
of a diversified  pool of hedge funds is modestly  lower than the levels we were
looking for at the start of 2008.  Inevitably,  the environment will continue to
change and the market will be faced with surprises, and, in fact, the challenges
facing the markets  today are greater  than they have been for some time.  There
are many  obstacles  facing the markets  which we believe will prove a challenge
for both traditional and hedge fund managers,  however with this uncertainty and
volatility comes opportunity and good hedge fund managers should be able to take
advantage of the environment we see on the horizon.

The Hedge Fund  Management  Group,  the  external  hedge fund  business  of Citi
Alternative Investments,  breaks the universe of hedge fund strategies down into
four  categories:  Directional  Equity,  Directional  Macro,  Event  Driven  and
Relative Value Arbitrage, with each of these categories divided into a number of
specific  sub-strategies.  The  expectations  for returns  associated  with this
diverse  universe of  strategies  varies  significantly,  and the  dispersion of
returns associated with the actual performance of individual managers comprising
each sub-strategy  remains very high. We believe strongly that manager selection
will be more important in 2008 than it was in 2007, and 2007 was a year in which
it was about having capital  deployed with the right managers.  Having the right
managers may add greater value than the actual strategy allocations.

Overall,  the  outlook  for  Directional  Equity  remains  constructive  with  a
particular  focus on managers  that  utilize  fundamental  stock  selection  and
proprietary  research for identifying long and short ideas. Equity managers with
a clear edge in alpha  generation  and generally  more  flexibility in adjusting
their net  exposure  we  believe  should be favored  over those with  longer net
exposure and higher betas.  While we would maintain  allocations to this sector,
investors  should expect to see higher  volatility  as we  anticipate  increased
equity market  volatility in the face of  uncertainty  on the strength of the US
economy, direction of interest rates and the outlook for inflation. In addition,
the market will need to focus on possible changes in government  policies as the
presidential  election  process heats up. We also believe there are  interesting
opportunities  in both the  international  developed  as well as in the emerging
markets.

The outlook  for  Directional  Macro is neutral  with a positive  leaning  tilt.
Managers in this sector have seen an improvement in the opportunity set over the
last several quarters. More importantly the equity tilt that many macro managers
had in 2007 has been  reduced  and  therefore  the  diversification  benefit  of
holding  macro funds has  increased.  We believe  managers  that utilize  higher
frequency trading strategies and both fundamental and technical factors in their
decision process should be favored.  In addition,  these managers should be able
to benefit from increased activity in the interest rate,  currency and commodity
markets.  One  should  remember  managers  in  this  space  tend  to be  just as
comfortable trading from a long bias as they are from a short one; additionally,
many will  trade  spread  positions.  Macro  managers,  especially  those in the
systematic space, continue to deliver returns that offer beneficial  correlation
characteristics  for portfolios of both traditional stock and bond holdings,  as
well as  portfolios  of other  hedge fund  strategies.  In general as the trades
these managers are exposed to have extended,  several have reduced the amount of
risk they are taking.  It is important to note that this could change quickly in
this specific sector.

Event Driven  strategies are positioned  with a neutral bias.  Given the current
and  anticipated  stress  in the  credit  markets  the  environment  looks  less
favorable  for event driven equity  managers.  Many  financial  buyers have been
sidelined  and the ability for companies to leverage  their  balance  sheets has
diminished.  That said, we anticipate an increase in strategic  acquisitions and
mergers. As a result,  focus on event driven equity managers that have operating
experience and can initiate and drive strategic deals, as well as merger focused
managers that can take advantage of strategic  opportunities.  Within the merger
space,  managers with a global focus or an ability to execute cross border deals
we  believe  should be  favored.  Event  driven  credit  managers  should  offer
interesting opportunities especially in the second half of the year. In fact, as
the year unfolds, we anticipate the current stress in credit markets

and dislocation in the structured  finance markets to provide  attractive return
prospects.  Keep in mind the best  returns  from this space may not be  achieved
until 2009 or 2010.  Within the credit  sector,  managers that focus on the loan
markets  look very  interesting.  Based on  current  loan  prices and the senior
secured nature and maturity profile of these securities,  it is not unreasonable
to expect managers that have the ability to perform solid credit work to be able
to achieve favorable returns on a non-leveraged basis. On a risk adjusted basis,
this part of the credit  sector  would  appear to offer  better  value than most
equity-focused  strategies.  As the opportunity in the credit space unfolds,  we
would begin with  managers that are focused  higher up in the capital  structure
and only venture down the capital  structure later in the year or in early 2009.
Patience should be rewarded in this sector.

For the  Relative  Value  category,  we maintain a negative  bias as many of the
trading  strategies in this group  require  managers to leverage  spreads.  As a
result,  one is exposed to  increased  liquidity  risk and a fair  amount of the
short tail risk, which is associated with the convergence  trades often utilized
within the strategy group. In this sector we would utilize market neutral equity
managers,  especially  those that focus on fundamental  factors.  We believe the
current  environment for the equity markets will create  significant  dispersion
between  pairs of stocks  and the  ability to capture  this  dispersion  without
taking on  directional  market  exposure  will be  beneficial  to managers  that
concentrate  on these  strategies.  In particular we favor  managers  focused on
specific sectors such as technology and health care. As the year progresses,  we
anticipate  opportunities to emerge in the convertible  arbitrage  sector.  This
sector has been  largely  uninteresting  but with recent  events  impacting  the
capital  markets  this space is once again  showing some signs of coming back to
life. In addition,  we believe some  exposure to managers in the prime  mortgage
sector look interesting; however manager selection here will be critical as will
focusing on the details of how the managers  build and manage their  portfolios.
If one is cautious there are opportunities to take advantage of the dislocations
that have occurred in the mortgage market.

Based on the  outlook  for  expected  returns and  volatility  coupled  with the
attractive  correlation  benefits of the asset class,  we believe a  diversified
portfolio of hedge fund  strategies  remains an attractive  way to diversify and
potentially add value to a balanced portfolio.

     1.   ORGANIZATION

          Citigroup Alternative Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
          LLC (the  "Company"  "Fund" or "Series G") was organized as a Delaware
          Limited   Liability  Company  on  August  16,  2002.  The  Company  is
          registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")
          as amended,  as a closed-end,  non-diversified  management  investment
          company.  The Company is also  registered  under the Securities Act of
          1933 ("1933 Act").

          The   investment   objective  of  Series  G  is  to  achieve   capital
          appreciation   principally   through  investing  in  investment  funds
          ("Investment  Funds")  managed  by  third-party   investment  managers
          ("Investment   Managers")   that  employ  a  variety  of   alternative
          investment  strategies.  These investment  strategies allow Investment
          Managers the  flexibility  to use leverage or short-side  positions to
          take advantage of perceived  inefficiencies across the global markets,
          often  referred to as  "alternative"  strategies.  Because  Investment
          Funds following alternative  investment strategies are often described
          as hedge funds, the investment program of Series G can be described as
          a fund of hedge funds.

          Shares  of Series G are sold to  eligible  investors  (referred  to as
          "Members").  The  minimum  initial  investment  in  Series G from each
          Member is $25,000 (and was $50,000 from January 1, 2003 to November 1,
          2003); the minimum additional investment is $10,000.

          Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or the  "Adviser"),  a
          Delaware  limited  liability  company and an  indirect,  wholly  owned
          subsidiary of Citigroup Inc., serves as Series G's investment adviser.
          The  Adviser  is  registered  as  an  investment   adviser  under  the
          Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,  and, among other things,
          is  responsible  for the  allocation  of Series  G's assets to various
          Investment Funds.  Under Series G's governing  documents,  the Company
          has delegated substantially all authority to oversee the management of
          the operations and assets of Series G to the Board of Directors.

     2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms of the
          respective limited partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
          agreements and offering  memoranda.  Series G values these investments
          at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the  Investment
          Funds.

          A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

          The net  asset  value of  Series G is  determined  as of the  close of
          business  at the end of each month in  accordance  with the  valuation
          principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to time
          pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

          Series G's  investments in Investment  Funds are carried at fair value
          as  determined  by Series G's  pro-rata  interest in the net assets of
          each Investment Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2008 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          All  valuations  utilize  financial   information   supplied  by  each
          Investment  Fund and are net of management and  performance  incentive
          fees or other allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers as
          required by the Investment Funds' agreements.  Each Investment Manager
          to which the Adviser  allocates  assets  will  charge  Series G, as an
          investor in an underlying  Investment  Fund, an  asset-based  fee, and
          some or all of the Investment Managers will receive  performance-based
          compensation in the form of an incentive fee. The asset-based  fees of
          the Investment  Managers are generally expected to range from 1% to 3%
          annually of the net assets under their  management  and the  incentive
          fee is  generally  expected  to range  from 15% to 25% of net  profits
          annually.

          The Company may invest in Investment Funds that may designate  certain
          investments  within those Investment  Funds,  typically those that are
          especially  illiquid  and/or  hard to value,  as  "special  situation"
          (often called  "Side-Pocket")  investments with additional  redemption
          limitations.  Such a Side-Pocket  is, in effect,  similar to a private
          equity fund that  requires its  investors  to remain  invested for the
          duration of the fund and  distributes  returns on the investment  only
          when liquid assets are generated  within the fund,  typically  through
          the sale of the fund's illiquid assets in exchange for cash.

          As a general  matter,  the fair value of Series G's  investment  in an
          Investment  Fund  represents  the amount that Series G can  reasonably
          expect to receive  from an  Investment  Fund if Series G's  investment
          were redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information available
          at the time.  The  Investment  Funds provide for periodic  redemptions
          ranging from monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally  require
          advance notice of a Member's  intent to redeem its interest,  and may,
          depending on the Investment Funds' governing agreements, deny or delay
          a redemption  request.  Series G does not factor into its  valuation a
          liquidity  discount  on any  Investment  Funds  held.  The  underlying
          investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as
          described  in  each  Investment  Fund's  financial   statements.   The
          Investment  Funds may invest a portion of their  assets in  restricted
          securities and other investments that are illiquid.

          In September 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB")
          released  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 157, Fair
          Value  Measurements  ("FAS 157").  This standard  establishes a single
          authoritative  definition  of fair  value,  sets out a  framework  for
          measuring  fair  value  and  expands   disclosures  about  fair  value
          measurements.  FAS 157  applies  to fair  value  measurements  already
          required or permitted by existing standards.  FAS 157 is effective for
          financial  statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November
          15, 2007, and interim  periods within those fiscal years.  As of March
          31,  2008,  the Adviser  does not believe the adoption of FAS 157 will
          materially impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional
          disclosures  will be  required  about the inputs  used to develop  the
          measurements  and the  effect of  certain  measurements  on changes in
          Members' Capital for the period.

          B.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

          Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Income, expenses and
          realized and  unrealized  gains and losses are recorded  monthly.  The
          change in an  Investment  Fund's net asset  value is  included  in net
          change in unrealized  appreciation  on investments on the Statement of
          Operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2008 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The  Company  records  realized  gain  or loss  on its  investment  in
          Investment  Funds only to the extent that cost of such  investment  as
          well as any Side  Pocket has been  fully  recovered  through  previous
          redemptions from investment in Investment Funds.

          Series G bears all expenses  incurred in the course of its operations,
          including,  but not limited to, the following:  all costs and expenses
          related  to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for  Series  G's
          account; professional fees; costs of insurance; registration expenses;
          and expenses of meetings of the Board of Directors.

          Costs incurred in connection  with the initial  offering were deferred
          and  amortized  over the  first  twelve  months of  operations;  costs
          incurred in connection with Series G's subsequent  registration  under
          the 1933 Act have been  deferred  and were  amortized  over the twelve
          months  commencing  after  the  effective  date of  such  registration
          statement.

          C.   INCOME TAXES

          Series G operated as a partnership  from inception  through  September
          30, 2005. As of October 1, 2005, Series G became a corporation that is
          taxed as a regulated investment company.

          It is Series G's  intention to meet the  requirements  of the Internal
          Revenue Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies (RIC) and
          distribute  substantially all of its taxable net investment income and
          capital  gains,  if any,  to  shareholders  each year.  Therefore,  no
          federal  income or excise tax  provision  is  typically  required  for
          Series G's financial statements.  While Series G intends to distribute
          substantially  all of its  taxable net  investment  income and capital
          gains,  in the manner  necessary to avoid  imposition of the 4% excise
          tax as described  above,  it is possible  that some excise tax will be
          incurred.  In such event,  Series G will be liable for the tax only on
          the  amount  by which it does  not  meet  the  foregoing  distribution
          requirements.

          During the current year, the Fund adopted FASB  Interpretation No. 48,
          Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides
          guidance  for  how  uncertain  tax  positions  should  be  recognized,
          measured,  presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48
          requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken
          in  the  course  of  preparing  the  Fund's  financial  statements  to
          determine  whether the tax  positions  are  "more-likely-than-not"  of
          being  sustained by the applicable  tax  authority.  Tax positions not
          deemed to meet the "more-likely-than-not"  threshold would be recorded
          as a tax  benefit or expense in the  current  year.  The  Adviser  has
          concluded  the adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the  operations  of
          the Fund for the year ended March 31, 2008 and that no  provision  for
          income tax is required in the Fund's financial statements.

          The Fund's federal and state income and federal excise tax returns for
          which the  applicable  statute of  limitations  have not  expired  are
          subject to  examination  by the  Internal  Revenue  Service  and state
          departments of revenue.

          D.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

          Cash  and cash  equivalents  consist  of cash on  deposit  and  monies
          invested in money market  deposit  accounts  that are accounted for at
          amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

          E.   USE OF ESTIMATES

          The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.
          generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires management of the
          Company to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the amounts
          reported  in  the  financial   statements  and   accompanying   notes.
          Management  believes that the estimates  utilized in preparing  Series
          G's financial statements are reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual
          results could differ from these estimates.

     3.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

          In March 2008,  the FASB  released  Statement of Financial  Accounting
          Standards  No.  161,  Disclosures  about  Derivative  Instruments  and
          Hedging   Activities  ("FAS  161").   FAS  161  requires   qualitative
          disclosures  about  objectives and  strategies for using  derivatives,
          quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts and gains and losses
          on derivative instruments,  and disclosures about  credit-risk-related
          contingent features in derivative agreements.  The adoption of FAS 161
          is required for fiscal  years  beginning  after  November 15, 2008 and
          interim  periods within those fiscal years.  At this time, the Company
          has not yet adopted FAS 161 and is evaluating the  implications of FAS
          161  and its  impact  on the  financial  statements  has not yet  been
          determined.

     4.   MANAGEMENT FEE,  ADMINISTRATIVE  FEE,  RELATED PARTY  TRANSACTIONS AND
          OTHER

          The Adviser provides certain management and administrative services to
          Series G. The Adviser acts primarily to evaluate and select Investment
          Managers,  to allocate assets,  to establish and apply risk management
          procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall  investment  performance.   In
          addition,  the Adviser also  provides  office space and other  support
          services.  In consideration  for such services,  Series G will pay the
          Adviser  a  monthly  management  fee  based on end of  month  Members'
          capital. The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to its affiliates.

          Effective August 1, 2005, the Board of Directors  approved a reduction
          in the  management  fee to 1.5% of net  assets  annually  (from  2.25%
          annually).

          In addition,  the Adviser  allocated certain marketing fees of $11,642
          to Series G during the year ended March 31, 2008.

          Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to assist in the
          placement of Fund Shares. A placement agent will generally be entitled
          to receive a fee from each  investor in the Company  whose  shares the
          agent  places.  The  specific  amount of the  placement  fee paid with
          respect  to a  Member  is  generally  dependent  on  the  size  of the
          investment in Series G.

          Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an affiliate of CAI and a
          wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc. serves as a placement agent
          of the Series G Shares. For the year ended March 31, 2008, the Company
          paid $2,530,018 in placement fees to CGM on Series G Shares. Such fees
          are deducted from an investor's gross contribution amount.

          The Company has entered into  agreements  with third parties to act as
          additional  placement  agents for Series G Shares.  Placement fees may
          range from 0 to 3%. In addition,  the Adviser,  and/or its affiliates,
          will pay the  placement  agents  an annual  fee,  payable  monthly  in
          arrears.  The fee shall be paid from the  Adviser's  own resources (or
          those of its affiliates).

          Prior to  October  1, 2005  Series G paid CAI a monthly  fee of 0.025%
          (0.30% on an annualized basis) for administration based primarily upon
          average net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and reimbursed
          certain expenses. CAI, as Administrator,  retained PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"),
          an  independent  third party and  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of The PNC
          Financial  Services  Group,  to  assist  in  the  performance  of  its
          administrative  duties.  On  October 1, 2005 a  restructuring  of this
          arrangement  took effect.  Under the new arrangement CAI and PFPC have
          separate agreements with the Company and act as  co-administrators  to
          the Company.  CAI, as  co-administrator,  no longer receives a monthly
          fee for their administrative  services to the Company.  PFPC continues
          to provide certain accounting, recordkeeping, tax and investor related
          services. Fees for their services are charged directly to the Company.

          Effective  January 1, 2008,  each  Director who is not an  "interested
          person" of the Company, as defined by the 1940 Act, receives an annual
          retainer of $20,000  plus a Board of  Directors  meeting fee of $1,000
          and a  telephone  meeting  fee of  $500.  The  Chairman  of the  Audit
          Committee  receives an additional fee of $3,000 per year. Any Director
          who is an "interested person" does not receive any annual or other fee
          from the Company.  All Directors are reimbursed for all reasonable out
          of pocket  expenses.  Total amounts  expensed  related to Directors by
          Series G for the year ended March 31, 2008 were $45,750.

          PFPC Trust  Company (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as  custodian  of
          Series G's assets and provides  custodial  services for Series G. Fees
          payable to the custodian and  reimbursement  for certain  expenses are
          paid by Series G. Total amounts  expensed related to custodian fees by
          Series G for the year ended March 31, 2008 were $49,687.

     6.   CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

          Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for shares may be
          accepted as of the first day of each month. CAI has been authorized by
          the Board of  Directors of the Company to accept or reject any initial
          and  additional  subscriptions  for  shares  in Series G. The Board of
          Directors  from  time  to  time  and in  its  complete  and  exclusive
          discretion,  may determine to cause Series G to repurchase shares from
          Members  pursuant  to  written  tenders  by  Members on such terms and
          conditions  as it may  determine.  CAI expects that it typically  will
          recommend  to the  Board  of  Directors  that  the  Company  offer  to
          repurchase shares from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31, June 30,
          September  30 and  December 31 (or, if any such date is not a business
          day, on the immediately preceding business day).

     7.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

          In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which Series
          G invests trade various  financial  instruments and enter into various
          investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but
          are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts
          and  entering  into  equity  swaps.  Series  G's risk of loss in these
          investment  funds is limited to the value of it's  investment  in such
          funds.

     8.   INCOME TAX INFORMATION

          The tax  components  of  capital  shown in the table  below  represent
          distribution  requirements  Series G must satisfy under the income tax
          regulations,  losses Series G may be able to offset against income and
          gains  realized  in  future  years  and  unrealized   appreciation  or
          depreciation  of securities and other  investments  for federal income
          tax purposes.

</TABLE>

          The  primary  difference  between  the  book and tax  appreciation  or
          depreciation of Investment Funds is attributable to adjustments to the
          tax basis of  Investment  Funds  based on  allocation  of  income  and
          distributions  from  Investment  Funds  and  the  tax  realization  of
          financial statement unrealized gain or loss. In addition,  the cost of
          Investment Funds for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items
          of taxable income  allocated  Series G from the Investment  Funds. The
          allocated  taxable  income is reported to Series G by each  Investment
          Fund on Schedule  K-1.  The  aggregate  cost on  Investment  Funds for
          federal  income tax purposes is  therefore  calculated  and  presented
          annually as of March 31. The aggregate  cost on  Investment  Funds and
          the  composition  of  unrealized   appreciation  and  depreciation  on
          Investment Funds for federal income tax purposes is noted below.

          Federal tax cost of Investment Funds                 $ 557,546,998

          Net unrealized appreciation                          $   4,428,171
                                                               =============

          Net  investment  income (loss) and net realized gain (loss) differ for
          financial  statement and tax purposes.  The character of dividends and
          distributions  made during the fiscal year from net investment  income
          or net realized gains differ from their ultimate  characterization for
          federal  income tax  purposes.  Also,  due to timing of dividends  and
          distributions, the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed differ
          from the  fiscal  year in which the  income or net  realized  gain was
          recorded by Series G.

          Accordingly,  the following  amounts have been  reclassified for March
          31, 2008, and are primarily due to the different book to tax treatment
          for the distributive share of partnership items, different book to tax
          treatment  for  gains  realized  on  the  sale  of  investment   funds
          classified as passive foreign investment  companies and the commitment
          penalty and fee described in Note 10.

</TABLE>

          For the year ended March 31, 2008, the tax character of  distributions
          paid by  Series  G was  $5,892,742  ordinary  income  and  $26,325,158
          long-term  capital  gains.  For the year ended March 31, 2007, the tax
          character of distributions  paid by Series G was $15,274,461  ordinary
          income and $7,372,824 of long term capital gains.  Distributions  from
          net  investment  income and  short-term  capital  gains are treated as
          ordinary income for federal income tax purposes.

     9.   LOAN PAYABLE

          On December  27,  2006,  Series G entered  into a Credit and  Security
          Agreement  with an  unaffiliated  bank  for a  $125,000,000  revolving
          credit facility (the "Credit  Facility").  The Credit Facility will be
          used in connection  with  investment  activities,  for cash management
          purposes,  to fund  the  repurchase  of  shares  or for  temporary  or
          emergency  purposes as permitted  under the Offering  Memorandum.  The
          Credit  Facility is secured by Series G's assets.  At March 31,  2008,
          the  outstanding  borrowing  from  the  Credit  Facility  amounted  to
          $25,400,000,  bearing  interest  at a rate of  5.25%  less a  discount
          percentage per annum.  Interest  expense on the outstanding  borrowing
          for the year  ended  March  31,  2008 was  $1,081,862,  with  $361,137
          payable at March 31, 2008.

     10.  COMMITMENT PENALTY AND FEE

          During the year ended March 31,  2008,  management  of the Company did
          not  fulfill a capital  commitment  related  to one of its  underlying
          investments.  Instead,  the Company paid a penalty based on 15% of the
          committed  amount plus interest  amounting to $2,151,669 as allowed by
          the Private  Placement  Memorandum of the underlying  Investment Fund.
          The  payment  of this  fee  released  the  Company  from  any  further
          liability for its  uncommitted  amount and is recorded as an operating
          expense in the Statement of Operations.

                             -----------------------

Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC (the
"Fund"),  a "series"  investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940  Act"),  has  adopted  these  proxy  voting
procedures  (the  "Procedures")  in  accordance  with,  and for the  purpose  of
complying with, rules related to proxy voting  promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange  Commission ("SEC") under the 1940 Act and the Investment  Advisers Act
of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act").


DELEGATION OF PROXY VOTING. The Fund has delegated the responsibility for voting
proxies of its underlying  portfolio funds (or other  underlying  securities) to
its  investment  adviser,  an adviser  registered  with the SEC  pursuant to the
Advisers Act. The investment  adviser,  Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC
("CAI"),  has  adopted  proxy-voting  procedures,  including  those  designed to
address  any  material  conflicts  of  interests  between  CAI and  its  clients
("Adviser  Procedures"),  which have been  reviewed and approved by the Board of
Directors of the Fund and are attached hereto.
<PAGE>

ANNUAL REVIEW. The Board of Directors of the Fund will review the Procedures and
the Adviser Procedures annually to ensure the procedures are reasonably designed
to ensure compliance with all relevant proxy-voting rules that are applicable to
the Funds.

FORM  N-PX.  Commencing  in 2004,  the Fund will  cause Form N-PX to be filed by
August 31 each year and will include  proxy-voting  information for the one-year
period ending that June 30. Form N-PX is an annual filing of the Fund's complete
proxy  voting  record  which  requires  information  disclosing:  (1) each proxy
proposal subject matter; (2) if the proxy proposal was proposed by the issuer or
a shareholder; (3) how the Fund cast its votes; and (4) if the vote cast was for
or against management.

NOTE:  BY AUGUST 31,  2008,  THE FUND WILL BE REQUIRED TO FILE FORM N-PX FOR THE
PERIOD JULY 1, 2007 TO JUNE 30, 2008.

DISCLOSURE OF PROXY PROCEDURES.  Commencing in 2003, the Fund will ensure that a
description of its (and CAI's)  proxy-voting  procedures,  including  procedures
related to  proxy-voting  conflicts of interest,  are  disclosed in its Offering
Memorandum (the Statement of Additional  Information portion, if applicable) and
shareholder reports.

NOTE:  REQUIRED WITH THE NEXT SUCH DOCUMENT FILED WITH THE SEC.

AVAILABILITY OF PROXY VOTING  PROCEDURES AND VOTING RECORD.  Commencing in 2004,
the Fund will state in its Offering  Memorandum  (the  Statement  of  Additional
Information  portion,  if  applicable)  and  shareholder  reports that its proxy
voting  procedures and voting records are available free of charge directly from
the Fund (or its  designee) as well as from the SEC website.  The Fund will make
its proxy  voting  records  available  on either a Fund or CAI  website  or upon
request by calling a toll-free or collect telephone number.

</TABLE>

         POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

         As shown in the table above, Mr. Nolte is responsible for managing
         other accounts ("Other Accounts") in addition to the Fund. In certain
         instances, conflicts may arise in his management of the Fund and such
         other Accounts.

         One situation where a conflict may arise between the Fund and an Other
         Account is in the allocation of investment opportunities among the Fund
         and the Other Account. For example, the Adviser may determine that
         there is an opportunity that is suitable for the Fund as well as for
         Other Accounts of the Adviser, which have a similar investment
         objective. As a related matter, a particular Investment Fund interest
         or other security may be bought for one or more clients when one or
         more other clients are selling that same security, which may adversely
         affect the Fund. The Company and the Adviser have adopted policies and
         procedures regarding the allocation of investment opportunities, which
         generally require that investment opportunities be allocated among the
         Fund and Other Accounts in a manner that is fair, equitable and
         consistent with their fiduciary obligations to each.

         Mr. Nolte's management of the Fund and Other Accounts may result in his
         devoting a disproportionate amount of time and attention to the
         management of a particular account as against another. This
         particularly may be the case when accounts have different objectives,
         benchmarks, time horizons, asset levels and fees.

         The management of personal accounts by Mr. Nolte may give rise to
         potential conflicts of interest. While the Adviser's code of ethics
         will impose limits on the ability of Mr. Nolte to trade for his
         personal account, there is no assurance that the Adviser's code of
         ethics will eliminate such conflicts.

         Other than the conflicts described above, the Company is not aware of
         any material conflicts that may arise in connection with the Adviser's
         management of the Fund's investments and such Other Accounts.

(a)(3)   COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM
         MEMBERS - AS OF MARCH 31, 2008

         Mr. Nolte's compensation is a combination of salary, discretionary
         bonus, deferred compensation, retirement plans and automatic
         participation in a company-funded retirement bonus. The discretionary
<PAGE>

         bonus is based upon the financial results and profitability of
         Citigroup as a whole, that of CAI as a whole, and that of CAI's Global
         Fund of Funds business unit, for which Mr. Nolte serves as chief
         executive. The discretionary bonus is not linked to the performance of
         any specific benchmark or that of any CAI investment fund or account;
         nor are specific asset size targets considered.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
      --------------------------------------------------------------------


I.       COVERED OFFICERS, PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This Code of Ethics  (the  "Code")  for the Fund  applies  to its Chief
         Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or
         persons  performing similar functions) (as of August 2005, Ray Nolte as
         President  and as of  December  2006 Amy Olsen as  Treasurer;  each,  a
         "Covered Officer") for the purpose of promoting:

         o        honest and ethical conduct,  including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent  conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         o        full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and  documents  that a company  files with, or submits
                  to, the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         o        compliance  with applicable  laws and  governmental  rules and
                  regulations;

         o        prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each  Covered  Officer  should  adhere to a high  standard  of
business  ethics and should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to
actual  as well as  apparent  conflicts  of  interest.  Any  question  about the
application  of the Code should be referred  to the Fund's  Chief Legal  Officer
(initially Millie Kim, General Counsel of the Fund's investment adviser).


II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
private interest interferes,  or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his or her service to, the Fund. For
<PAGE>

example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her
position with the Fund.(1)

         Certain  conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company Act") and
the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940  ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions  (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other  property)  with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated  persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its  investment  adviser's  compliance  programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures,  and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code,  unless or until the Chief Legal Officer  determines any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit,  conflicts  may  arise  from,  or  as  a  result  of,  the  contractual
relationship  between the Fund and its  investment  adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes that
the  Covered  Officers  will,  in the  normal  course of their  duties  (whether
formally  for  the  Fund  or for the  adviser,  or for  both),  be  involved  in
establishing  policies  and  implementing  decisions  that will  have  different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual  relationship between
the Fund and the adviser and is consistent  with the  performance by the Covered
Officers  of their  duties  as  officers  of the Fund.  Thus,  if  performed  in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically.  In
addition,  it is recognized by the Fund's Board of Directors  ("Board") that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other  conflicts  of  interest  are  covered by the Code,  even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to  provisions in the  Investment  Company
Act and the  Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the
personal  interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly  before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         o        use his or her personal  influence  or personal  relationships
                  improperly  to  influence  investment  decisions  or financial

- ----------
(1) Because conflicts of interest may arise as a result of family relationships,
each  Covered  Officer  should   consider  such  potential   conflicts  and,  if
appropriate,  familiarize  his or her family members with the Covered  Officer's
relevant obligations under this Code.
<PAGE>

                  Officer would benefit  personally  (directly or indirectly) to
                  the detriment of the Fund;

         o        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  (direct  or  indirect)  individual  personal  benefit  of  the
                  Covered Officer rather than the benefit of the Fund; or

         o        use material  non-public  knowledge of portfolio  transactions
                  made or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause
                  others to trade  personally  in  contemplation  of the  market
                  effect of such transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report all
affiliations  and significant  business  interests  outside the Citigroup,  Inc.
corporate group and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest  situations should always be approved by the Chief
Legal Officer and, if material,  be communicated to the relevant Fund's Board of
Directors. Examples of these include:

         o        service as a director on the board of any company;

         o        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts  and  gratuities  in  excess  of $100 per year  from any
                  person  or  entity   with  which  the  Fund  has   current  or
                  prospective business dealings,  not including occasional meals
                  or  tickets to theatre  or  sporting  events or other  similar
                  entertainment, provided it is business-related,  reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety.

         o        any  ownership  interest in, or any  consulting  or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers,  other
                  than   its    investment    adviser,    principal    placement
                  agent/underwriter, or any affiliated person thereof;

         o        a  direct  or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,
                  transaction  charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio  transactions  or for  selling or  redeeming  shares
                  other than an  interest  arising  from the  Covered  Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.


III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o        Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself or herself
                  with the disclosure  requirements  generally applicable to the
                  Fund;

         o        each Covered  Officer  should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or
                  cause others to misrepresent,  facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether  within or outside the Fund,
<PAGE>

                  including  to  the  Fund's  Directors  and  auditors,  and  to
                  governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o        each Covered Officer should, to the extent  appropriate within
                  his or her area of responsibility, consult with other officers
                  and  employees  of the Fund and its  adviser  with the goal of
                  promoting  full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable
                  disclosure  in the reports and  documents the Fund files with,
                  or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made
                  by the Fund; and

         o        it is  the  responsibility  of  each  Covered  Officer  to use
                  reasonable  efforts to promote  compliance  with the standards
                  and  restrictions   imposed  by  applicable  laws,  rules  and
                  regulations.


IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o        upon  adoption of the Code  (thereafter  as  applicable,  upon
                  becoming  a Covered  Officer),  affirm in writing to the Board
                  that he or she has received, read and understands the Code;

         o        annually  thereafter  affirm to the  Board  that he or she has
                  complied with the requirements of the Code;

         o        not  retaliate  against  any  other  Covered  Officer  or  any
                  employee of the Fund or its affiliated  persons for reports of
                  potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o        notify the Chief Legal Officer  promptly if he or she knows of
                  any  violation  of this  Code.  Failure  to do so is  itself a
                  violation of this Code.

         The Chief  Legal  Officer  is  responsible  for  applying  this Code to
specific  situations  in  which  questions  are  presented  under it and has the
authority to  interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  However,  any
explicit or implicit  waivers(2)  sought by a Covered Officer must be considered
by the Audit Committee of the relevant Fund as described below.

         The Fund will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

         o        the  Chief  Legal  Officer  will  take  appropriate  action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him or her;


- ----------
(2) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines  "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material  departure  form a  provision  of the code of ethics"  and  "implicit
waiver" as "the  registrant's  failure to take action within a reasonable period
of time  regarding a material  departure  from a provision of the code of ethics
that has been made known to an executive officer" of the registrant.
<PAGE>

         o        if, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the Chief Legal Officer is not
                  required  to take any further  action,  but will meet with the
                  person  reporting  the  violation for the purpose of informing
                  such person of the reason for not taking action;

         o        any  matter  that  the  Chief  Legal  Officer  believes  is  a
                  violation  will be  reported  to the  Audit  Committee  of the
                  Fund's Board;

         o        if the Audit Committee  concurs that a violation has occurred,
                  they will  consider  appropriate  action,  which  may  include
                  review  of,  and  appropriate   modifications  to,  applicable
                  policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel
                  of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to
                  dismiss the Covered Officer as an officer of the Fund;

         o        the Audit Committee will be responsible for granting  waivers,
                  as appropriate,  provided that waivers will be considered only
                  if  supported  by a written  request on behalf of the relevant
                  Covered Officer  explaining the basis for such request and how
                  the waiver may be implemented  consistent  with the principles
                  underlying this Code; and

         o        any  changes to or  waivers  of this Code will,  to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

         The Audit Committee,  in determining  whether waivers should be granted
or whether violations have occurred,  and the Chief Legal Officer,  in rendering
decisions  and  interpretations  and in conducting  investigations  of potential
violations  under the Code,  may, at their  discretion,  consult with such other
persons as they  determine  to be  appropriate,  including,  but not limited to,
another  senior  legal  officer  of the Fund or its  investment  adviser  or its
affiliates,  counsel to the Fund or its  investment  adviser or such  affiliate,
counsel to the  Independent  Directors,  or (subject to applicable  pre-approval
requirements) independent auditors or other consultants


V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This  Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the Fund for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Fund,  the Fund's  investment  adviser,  principal
placement  agent/underwriter,  or other service  providers  govern or purport to
govern the  behavior or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to
this Code,  they are  superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or
conflict  with the  provisions  of this Code,  unless any provision of this Code
conflicts  with  any  applicable  federal  or  state  law,  in  which  case  the
requirements  of such law will govern.  The Fund's and its investment  adviser's
and principal  placement  agent/underwriter's  codes of ethics under 17j-1
<PAGE>

under the Investment Company Act are separate requirements that may apply to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.


VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any  amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by a majority
vote of the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors.


VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this Code
will  be  considered   confidential   and  shall  be  maintained  and  protected
accordingly.  Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent  Directors and their
counsel,  the Fund and its  counsel and the  investment  adviser and its counsel
(and,  as relevant,  any other  person  described  in the last  paragraph  under
"Reporting and Accountability" above).


VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the Fund and does
not  constitute  an  admission,  by or on behalf  of the  Fund,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.





I  have  read  and   understand   the  terms  of  the  Code.  I  recognize   the
responsibilities  and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the Code.
