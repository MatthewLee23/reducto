Annual Report

This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund (the "Fund") for the annual reporting period
ended October 31, 2005. The Fund is a closed-end fund that trades under the New
York Stock Exchange symbol "AFB".

Investment Objective and Policies

The Fund is a closed-end management investment company that invests principally
in high-yielding, predominantly medium-quality municipal securities with
interest that is exempt from federal income tax, although these securities may
pay interest that is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax ("AMT") for
certain taxpayers. The Fund invests primarily in municipal bonds with long-term
maturities in order to maintain a weighted average maturity of 15-30 years, but
the average weighted maturity of obligations held by the Fund may be shortened,
depending on market conditions. Under normal conditions, the Fund invests at
least 80%, and normally substantially all, of its assets in municipal
securities paying interest that is exempt from regular federal income tax. In
addition, the Fund normally invests at least 75% of its assets in investment
grade municipal securities. For more information regarding the Fund's risks,
please see "A Word About Risk" on page 3 and "Note G-Risks Involved in
Investing in the Fund" of the Notes to Financial Statements on page 25.

Investment Results

The table on page 4 provides performance data for the Fund and its benchmark,
the Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index, for the six- and 12-month periods
ended October 31, 2005. For comparison, returns for the Lipper General
Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) Average (the "Lipper Average") are also
included. The funds that comprise the Lipper Average have generally similar
investment objectives to the Fund, although some may have different investment
policies and sales and management fees.

The Fund outperformed its benchmark during both the six- and 12-month periods
ended October 31, 2005. The Fund's stronger relative performance during the
12-month period under review was largely the result of security selection in
the insured and special tax sectors. The Fund's relative exposure to the
pre-refunded and hospital bond sectors also contributed positively to the
Fund's performance. In addition, the Fund's leveraged structure aided its
performance. The Fund's lack of exposure to bonds backed by the Master
Settlement Agreement with the tobacco industry hurt performance relative to the
benchmark. During both the six- and 12-month periods, the Fund also
outperformed its peer group, as represented by the Lipper Average.

Market Review and Investment Strategy

For the 12-month period ended October 31, 2005, yields on municipal bonds with
maturities out to 20 years rose, while those with longer than 20-year
maturities declined slightly. For example, five- to 10-year yields rose, on
average, 0.66% while 20- to 25-year bond yields declined by an average of
0.03%. Rising short-term rates were in line with the actions of the


_______________________________________________________________________________

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 1


U.S. Federal Reserve. Since October 2004, the Federal Reserve Open Market
Committee voted to increase the Fed Funds rate by 0.25% on nine separate
occasions to the current level of 4.0%. In contrast, strong demand for U.S.
taxable bonds by foreign investors and a relatively favorable inflationary
environment have led to lower yields for long-term bonds.

During this period, total returns were positive for municipal bonds of all
maturities. On a pre-tax basis, the municipal bond market outperformed the
taxable bond market. The LB Municipal Index gained 2.54% during the period
while the LB U.S. Aggregate Index, representing taxable bonds, gained 1.13%. As
of October 31, 2005, 20- to 30-year municipal bonds were yielding, on average,
94.2% of comparable maturity Treasury bonds compared to an average ratio of
92.2% last year.

Interest rates are still low by historical standards versus inflation.
Therefore, portfolio durations are still slightly below the benchmark duration
as a defensive measure. The continued low municipal yield environment has also
led to ongoing heavier-than-normal demand for lower-rated, higher-yielding
bonds as investors seek income. In the view of the Fund's Municipal Bond
Investment Team, that demand has made lower-rated bonds more expensive than
they have been on an historic basis. To take advantage of that opportunity, the
Team sold lower-rated bonds and replaced them with higher-quality bonds. State
and local government tax revenues have continued to improve in line with
general economic growth.

HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE

An Important Note About the Value of Historical Performance

The performance on the following page represents past performance and does not
guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the
performance information shown. Returns are annualized for periods longer than
one year. All fees and expenses related to the operation of the Fund have been
deducted. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not
account for taxes.

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund Shareholder Information

Daily market prices for the Fund's shares are published in the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Transaction section of The Wall Street Journal under the
abbreviation "AllianceNA." The Fund's NYSE trading symbol is "AFB." Weekly
comparative net asset value (NAV) and market price information about the Fund
is published each Monday in The Wall Street Journal, each Sunday in The New
York Times and each Saturday in Barron's and other newspapers in a table called
"Closed-End Bond Funds." For additional shareholder information regarding this
Fund, please see page 41.

Benchmark Disclosure

The unmanaged Lehman Brothers (LB) Municipal Index does not reflect fees and
expenses associated with the active management of a mutual fund portfolio. The
Index is a total return performance benchmark for the long-term, investment
grade, tax-exempt bond market. For both the six- and 12-month periods ended
October 31, 2005, the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) Average
consisted of 64 funds. These funds have generally similar investment objectives
to the Fund, although some may have different investment policies and sales and
management fees. An investor cannot invest directly in an index or average, and
their results are not indicative of the performance for any specific
investment, including the Fund.

A Word About Risk

Among the risks of investing in the Fund are changes in the general level of
interest rates or changes in bond credit quality ratings. Changes in interest
rates have a greater effect on bonds with longer maturities than on those with
shorter maturities. Please note, as interest rates rise, existing bond prices
fall and can cause the value of your investment in the Fund to decline. While
the Fund invests principally in bonds and other fixed-income securities, in
order to achieve its investment objectives, the Fund may at times use certain
types of investment derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.
These instruments involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater
than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. At the discretion of
the Fund's Adviser, the Fund may invest up to 25% of its net assets in
municipal bonds that are rated below investment grade ("junk bonds"). These
securities involve greater volatility and risk than higher-quality fixed-income
securities.

The issuance of the Fund's preferred stock results in leveraging of the Common
Stock, an investment technique usually considered speculative. Leverage creates
certain risks for holders of Common Stock, including higher volatility of both
the net asset value and market value of the Common Stock, and fluctuations in
the dividend rates on the preferred stock will affect the return to holders of
Common Stock. If the Fund were fully invested in longer-term securities and if
short-term interest rates were to increase, then the amount of dividends paid
on the preferred shares would increase and both net investment income available
for distribution to the holders of Common Stock and the net asset value of the
Common Stock would decline. At the same time, the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock (that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may,
as a result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common
Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the price of the
portfolio's investments, since the value of the Fund's Preferred Stock does not
fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net asset value, the market value of
the Fund's Common Stock may also decline.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 19


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
October 31, 2005

NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies

Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), was incorporated in
the state of Maryland on November 9, 2001 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which requires management to
make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation

Portfolio securities are valued at their current market value determined on the
basis of market quotations or, if market quotations are not readily available
or are deemed unreliable, at "fair value" as determined in accordance with
procedures established by and under the general supervision of the Fund's Board
of Directors.

In general, the market value of securities which are readily available and
deemed reliable are determined as follows. Securities listed on a national
securities exchange or on a foreign securities exchange are valued at the last
sale price at the close of the exchange or foreign securities exchange. If
there has been no sale on such day, the securities are valued at the mean of
the closing bid and asked prices on such day. Securities listed on more than
one exchange are valued by reference to the principal exchange on which the
securities are traded; securities not listed on an exchange but traded on The
NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued in accordance with the NASDAQ
Official Closing Price; listed put or call options are valued at the last sale
price. If there has been no sale on that day, such securities will be valued at
the closing bid prices on that day; open futures contracts and options thereon
are valued using the closing settlement price or, in the absence of such a
price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are no quotations available
for the day of valuation, the last available closing settlement price is used;
securities traded in the over-the-counter market, ("OTC") (but excluding
securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of the current bid and
asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or other comparable
sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt instruments having 60 days
or less remaining until maturity are valued at amortized cost if their original
maturity was 60 days or less; or by amortizing their fair value as of the 61st
day prior to maturity if their original term to maturity exceeded 60 days;
fixed-income securities, including mortgage backed and asset backed securities,
may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a pricing service or at a
price obtained from one or more of the major broker/dealers. In cases where


_______________________________________________________________________________

20 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


broker/dealer quotes are obtained, Alliance Capital Management, L.P. (the
"Adviser") may establish procedures whereby changes in market yields or spreads
are used to adjust, on a daily basis, a recently obtained quoted price on a
security; and OTC and other derivatives are valued on the basis of a quoted bid
price or spread from a major broker/dealer in such security.

Securities for which market quotations are not readily available (including
restricted securities) or are deemed unreliable are valued at fair value.
Factors considered in making this determination may include, but are not
limited to, information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, analysis
of the issuer's financial statements or other available documents. In addition,
the Fund may use fair value pricing for securities primarily traded in non-U.S.
markets because, most foreign markets close well before the Fund values its
securities at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time. The earlier close of these foreign
markets gives rise to the possibility that significant events, including broad
market moves, may have occurred in the interim and may materially affect the
value of those securities.

2. Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions

Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the trade date the securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and
losses are determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums
and accretes original issue discounts and market discounts as adjustments to
interest income.

4. Dividends and Distributions

Dividends and distributions to shareholders, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Income dividends and capital gains distributions are
determined in accordance with federal tax regulations and may differ from those
determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. To
the extent these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment;
temporary differences do not require such reclassification.

NOTE B
Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates

Under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of .65 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net
assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders. Such fee is accrued
daily


_______________________________________________________________________________

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 21


and paid monthly. The Adviser has voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its
fees or reimburse the Fund for expenses in the amount of 0.25% of the Fund's
average daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders for
the first 5 full years of the Fund's operations, 0.20% of the Fund's average
daily net assets applicable to common and preferred shareholders in year 6,
0.15% in year 7, 0.10% in year 8, and 0.05% in year 9. For the year ended
October 31, 2005, which is year 4 of operations, the amount of such fees waived
was $1,284,310.

Under the terms of a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance Global
Investor Services, Inc. (AGIS), an affiliate of the Adviser, the Fund
reimburses AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone inquiries for the Fund.
During the year ended October 31, 2005, there was no reimbursement paid to AGIS.

NOTE C
Investment Transactions

Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the year ended October 31, 2005, were as follows:

                                                   Purchases          Sales

The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes, gross unrealized
appreciation and unrealized depreciation (excluding swap and futures
transactions) are as follows:

Cost                                                             $  476,807,897
                                                                 ==============
Gross unrealized appreciation                                    $   22,657,052

                                                                 --------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                      $   22,002,548
                                                                 ==============

1. Swap Agreements

The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and
credit risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates
two parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based
upon or calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a
specified amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted
against each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by
the failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interim payment
to be received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the
contract. Therefore,


_______________________________________________________________________________

22 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each counterparty to a swap contract
in evaluating potential credit risk. Additionally, risks may arise from
unanticipated movements in interest rates or in the value of the underlying
securities.

As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. The Fund accrues for the interim payments on
swap contracts on a daily basis, with the net amount recorded within unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts on the statement of assets and
liabilities. Once the interim payments are settled in cash, the net amount is
recorded as realized gain/loss on swaps, in addition to realized gain/loss
recorded upon the termination of swap contracts on the statement of operations.
Prior to November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within
interest income/expense in the statement of operations. Fluctuations in the
value of swap contracts are recorded as a component of net change in unrealized
appreciation/depreciation of investments.

2. Financial Futures Contracts

The Fund may buy or sell financial futures contracts for the purpose of hedging
the portfolio against adverse effects of anticipated movements in the market.
The Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in the value of these
financial instruments and the imperfect correlation between movements in the
price of the futures contracts and movements in the price of the securities
hedged or used for cover.

At the time the Fund enters into a futures contract, the Fund deposits and
maintains as collateral an initial margin as required by the exchange on which
the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the Fund agrees to
receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily
fluctuation in the value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses.
Risks may arise from the potential inability of the counterparty to meet the
terms of the contract. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the
time it was opened and the time it was closed.

NOTE D
Common Stock

The Fund has 1,999,992,200 shares of $.001 par value common stock authorized.
There are 20,471,667 shares of common stock outstanding at October 31, 2005.

NOTE E
Preferred Stock

The Fund has authorized, issued and outstanding 7,800 shares of Auction


_______________________________________________________________________________

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 23


Preferred Stock, consisting of 1,950 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series
W and Series TH. The preferred shares have a liquidation value of $25,000 per
share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends. The dividend rate on the Auction
Preferred Stock may change generally every 7 days as set by the auction agent
for Series M, T, W and TH. The dividend rate on the Series M is 2.59% effective
through November 7, 2005. The dividend rate on the Series T is 2.61% effective
through November 1, 2005. The dividend rate on the Series W is 2.58% effective
through November 2, 2005. The dividend rate on the Series TH is 2.71% effective
through November 3, 2005.

At certain times, the Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund, in whole or
in part, at $25,000 per share plus accumulated, unpaid dividends.

Although the Fund will not ordinarily redeem the Preferred Shares, it may be
required to redeem shares if, for example, the Fund does not meet an asset
coverage ratio required by law or to correct a failure to meet a rating agency
guideline in a timely manner. The Fund voluntarily may redeem the Preferred
Shares in certain circumstances.

The Preferred Shareholders, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect
at least two Directors at all times and to elect a majority of the Directors in
the event two years' dividends on the Preferred Shares are unpaid. In each
case, the remaining Directors will be elected by the Common Shareholders and
Preferred Shareholders voting together as a single class. The Preferred
Shareholders will vote as a separate class on certain other matters as required
under the Fund's Charter, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Maryland law.

NOTE F
Distributions To Common Shareholders

The tax character of distributions paid to common shareholders during the
fiscal years ended October 31, 2005 and October 31, 2004 were as follows:

                                                  2005             2004

24 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


As of October 31, 2005, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit)
applicable to common shareholders on a tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed tax exempt income                              $    3,739,296
                                                             --------------
Accumulated capital and other losses                             (1,454,343)(a)
                                                             --------------
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)                           22,209,130(b)
                                                             --------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)                         $   24,494,083(c)
                                                             --------------

(a)  On October 31, 2005, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
$1,454,343 of which $1,444,137 expires in the year 2011, and $10,206 expires in
the year 2012. To the extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss
carryforward, such gains will not be distributed. During the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2005, the Fund utilized capital loss carryforwards of $2,385,306.

(b)  The differences between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
appreciation/(depreciation) are attributed primarily to the difference between
the book and tax treatment of swap income and the realization for tax purposes
of gain/losses on certain derivative instruments.

(c)  The difference between book-basis and tax-basis components of accumulated
earnings/(deficit) is attributable primarily to dividends payable.


During the current fiscal year, permanent differences, primarily due to the tax
treatment of swap income, resulted in a net increase in undistributed net
investment income and an increase in accumulated net realized loss on
investment transactions. This reclassification had no effect on net assets.

NOTE G
Risks Involved in Investing in the Fund

Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk--Interest rate risk is the risk that changes
in interest rates will affect the value of the Fund's investments in
fixed-income debt securities such as bonds or notes. Increases in interest
rates may cause the value of the Fund's investments to decline. Credit risk is
the risk that the issuer or guarantor of a debt security, or the counterparty
to a derivative contract, will be unable or unwilling to make timely principal
and/or interest payments, or to otherwise honor its obligations. The degree of
risk for a particular security may be reflected in its credit risk rating.
Credit risk is greater for medium quality and lower-rated securities.
Lower-rated debt securities and similar unrated securities (commonly known as
"junk bonds") have speculative elements or are predominantly speculative risks.

Indemnification Risk--In the ordinary course of business, the Fund enters into
contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

NOTE H
Legal Proceedings

As has been previously reported, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") and the Office of the New York Attorney General ("NYAG")
have been investigating practices in the mutual fund industry identified as
"market timing" and "late trading" of mutual fund shares. Certain other
regulatory authorities have also been conducting investigations into these
practices within the industry and have requested that the Adviser provide
information to them. The Adviser has been cooperating and will continue to
cooperate with all of these authorities. The shares of the Fund are not
redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an exchange at prices established by
the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its shareholders are not subject to the
market timing and late trading practices that are the subject of the
investigations mentioned above or the lawsuits described below. Please see
below for a description of the agreements reached by the Adviser and the SEC
and NYAG in connection with the investigations mentioned above.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the Adviser and certain other
defendants in which plaintiffs make claims purportedly based on or related to
the same practices that are the subject of the SEC and NYAG investigations
referred to above. Some of these lawsuits name the Fund as a party. The
lawsuits are now pending in the United States District Court for the District
of Maryland pursuant to a ruling by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict
Litigation transferring and centralizing all of the mutual funds involving
market and late trading in the District of Maryland (the "Mutual Fund MDL").
Management of the Adviser believes that these private lawsuits are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial
condition of the Fund.

On December 18, 2003, the Adviser confirmed that it had reached terms with the
SEC and the NYAG for the resolution of regulatory claims relating to the
practice of "market timing" mutual fund shares in some of the AllianceBernstein
Mutual Funds. The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an Order of the
Commission ("SEC Order"). The agreement with the NYAG is memorialized in an
Assurance of Discontinuation dated September 1, 2004 ("NYAGOrder"). Among the
key provisions of these agreements are the following:

(i)  The Adviser agreed to establish a $250 million fund (the "Reimbursement
Fund") to compensate mutual fund shareholders for the adverse effects of market
timing attributable to market timing relationships described in the SEC Order.
According to the SEC Order, the Reimbursement Fund is to be paid, in order of
priority, to fund investors based on (i) their aliquot share of losses suffered
by the fund due to market timing, and (ii) a proportionate share of advisory
fees paid by such fund during the period of such market timing;


_______________________________________________________________________________

26 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


(ii)  The Adviser agreed to reduce the advisory fees it receives from some of
the AllianceBernstein long-term, open-end retail funds, commencing January 1,
2004, for a period of at least five years; and

(iii)  The Adviser agreed to implement changes to its governance and compliance
procedures. Additionally, the SEC Order contemplates that the Adviser's
registered investment company clients, including the Fund, will introduce
governance and compliance changes.

The shares of the Fund are not redeemable by the Fund, but are traded on an
exchange at prices established by the market. Accordingly, the Fund and its
shareholders are not subject to the market timing practices described in the
SEC Order and are not expected to participate in the Reimbursement Fund. Since
the Fund is a closed-end fund, it will not have its advisory fee reduced
pursuant to the terms of the agreements mentioned above.

On February 10, 2004, the Adviser received (i) a subpoena duces tecum from the
Office of the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia and (ii) a request
for information from West Virginia's Office of the State Auditor, Securities
Commission (the "West Virginia Securities Commission") (together, the
"Information Requests"). Both Information Requests require the Adviser to
produce documents concerning, among other things, any market timing or late
trading in the Adviser's sponsored mutual funds. The Adviser responded to the
Information Requests and has been cooperating fully with the investigation.

On April 11, 2005, a complaint entitled The Attorney General of the State of
West Virginia v. AIM Advisors, Inc., et al. ("WVAG Complaint") was filed
against the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P. ("Alliance
Holding"), and various other defendants not affiliated with the Adviser. The
WVAG Complaint was filed in the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia
by the Attorney General of the State of West Virginia. The WVAG Complaint makes
factual allegations generally similar to those in certain of the complaints
related to the lawsuits discussed above. On May 31, 2005, defendants removed
the WVAG Complaint to the United States District Court for the Northern
District of West Virginia. On July 12, 2005, plaintiff moved to remand. On
October 19, 2005, the WVAG Complaint was transferred to the Mutual fund MDL.

On August 30, 2005, the deputy commissioner of securities of the West Virginia
Securities Commission signed a "Summary Order to Cease and Desist, and Notice
of Right to Hearing" addressed to the Adviser and Alliance Holding. The Summary
Order claims that the Adviser and Alliance Holding violated the West Virginia
Uniform Securities Act, and makes factual allegations generally similar to
those in the SEC Order and the NYAG Order. The Adviser intends to vigorously
defend against the allegations in the WVAG Complaint.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 27


On June 22, 2004, a purported class action complaint entitled Aucoin, et al. v.
Alliance Capital Management L.P., et al. ("Aucoin Complaint") was filed against
the Adviser, Alliance Capital Management Holding L.P., Alliance Capital
Management Corporation, AXA Financial, Inc., AllianceBernstein Investment
Research & Management, Inc., certain current and former directors of the
AllianceBernstein Mutual Funds, and unnamed Doe defendants. The Aucoin
Complaint names certain of the AllianceBernstein mutual funds as nominal
defendants. The Fund was not named as a defendant in the Aucoin Complaint. The
Aucoin Complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York by an alleged shareholder of an AllianceBernstein mutual
fund. The Aucoin Complaint alleges, among other things, (i) that certain of the
defendants improperly authorized the payment of excessive commissions and other
fees from fund assets to broker-dealers in exchange for preferential marketing
services, (ii) that certain of the defendants misrepresented and omitted from
registration statements and other reports material facts concerning such
payments, and (iii) that certain defendants caused such conduct as control
persons of other defendants. The Aucoin Complaint asserts claims for violation
of Sections 34(b), 36(b) and 48(a) of the Investment Company Act, Sections 206
and 215 of the Advisers Act, breach of common law fiduciary duties, and aiding
and abetting breaches of common law fiduciary duties. Plaintiffs seek an
unspecified amount of compensatory damages and punitive damages, rescission of
their contracts with the Adviser, including recovery of all fees paid to the
Adviser pursuant to such contracts, an accounting of all fund-related fees,
commissions and soft dollar payments, and restitution of all unlawfully or
discriminatorily obtained fees and expenses.

Since June 22, 2004, numerous additional lawsuits making factual allegations
substantially similar to those in the Aucoin Complaint were filed against the
Adviser and certain other defendants, and others may be filed.

On October 19, 2005, the District Court granted in part, and denied in part,
defendants' motion to dismiss the Aucoin Complaint and as a result the only
claim remaining is plaintiffs' Section 36(b).

The Adviser believes that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Fund or the Adviser's ability to perform advisory
services relating to the Fund.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 29


(a)  As of November 1, 2003, the Fund has adopted the method of accounting for
interim payments on swap contracts in accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board Statement No. 133. These interim payments are reflected within
net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts, however, prior to
November 1, 2003, these interim payments were reflected within interest
income/expense on the statement of operations. For the year ended October 31,
2004, the effect of this change to the net investment income and the net
realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investment transactions was less than
$0.01 per share and the ratio of net investment income to average net assets
was .00%.

(b)  Commencement of operations. Net asset value immediately after the closing
of the first public offering was $14.30.

(c)  Based on average shares outstanding.

(d)  Net of fees waived by the Adviser.

(e)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
on the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
the period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based on
net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on market
value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a decrease in
the premium of the market value to net asset value from the beginning to the
end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return based on net asset
value will be lower than total investment return based on market value in
periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an increase in the premium
of the market value to the net asset value from the beginning to the end of the
period. Total investment return calculated for a period of less than one year
is not annualized.

(f)  These expense and net investment income ratios do not reflect the effect
of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(g)  Annualized.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the
portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2005, and the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets
applicable to common shareholders for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of October 31, 2005 by correspondence with
the custodian and others or by other appropriate auditing procedures where
replies from others were not received. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. at October 31, 2005, the results
of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets
applicable to common shareholders for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION (unaudited)

In accordance with Federal tax law, the Fund's designation of "exempt-interest
dividends" paid during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005 was $24,410,582.

As required by Federal tax law rules, shareholders will receive notification of
their portion of the Fund's taxable ordinary dividends (if any) and capital
gain distributions (if any) paid for the 2005 calendar year on Form 1099-DIV
which will be mailed by January 31, 2006.

ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 31


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
(unaudited)

Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names can elect to
participate in the Dividend Reinvest-ment Plan (the "Plan"), pursuant to which
dividends and capital gain distributions to shareholders will be paid in or
reinvested in additional shares of the Fund (the "Dividend Shares"). Equiserve
Trust Company NA, (the "Agent") will act as agent for participants under the
Plan. Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of broker or nominee
should contact such broker or nominee to determine whether or how they may
participate in the Plan.

If the Board declares an income distribution or determines to make a capital
gain distribution payable either in shares or in cash,  non-participants in the
Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent
in shares of Common Stock of the Fund valued as follows:

(i)  If the shares of Common Stock are trading at net asset value or at a
premium above net asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new
shares at the greater of net asset value or 95% of the then current market
price.

(ii)  If the shares of Common Stock are trading at a discount from net asset
value at the time of valuation, the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or
distribution in cash and apply it to the purchase of the Fund's shares of
Common Stock in the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
for the participants' accounts. Such purchases will be made on or shortly after
the payment date for such dividend or distribution and in no event more than 30
days after such date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
purchase is necessary to comply with Federal securities laws. If, before the
Plan agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset
value of a share of Common Stock, the average purchase price per share paid by
the Plan agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares of Common
Stock, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or
distribution had been paid in shares issued by the Fund.

The Agent will maintain all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and furnish
written confirmation of all transactions in the account, including information
needed by shareholders for tax records. Shares in the account of each Plan
participant will be held by the Agent in non-certificate form in the name of
the participant, and each shareholder's proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan.

There will be no charges with respect to shares issued directly by the Fund to
satisfy the dividend reinvestment requirements. However, each participant will
pay a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the
Agent's open market purchases of shares.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions will not relieve
participants of any income taxes that


_______________________________________________________________________________

32 o ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND


may be payable (or required to be withheld) on dividends and distributions.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable. Accordingly,
the Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent
to written notice of the change sent to participants in the Plan at least 90
days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan may
also be amended or terminated by the Agent on at least 90 days' written notice
to participants in the Plan. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Agent at Equiserve Trust Company N.A. c/o Alliance National
Municipal Income fund, P.O. Box 43011, Providence, RI 02940-3011.

Since the filing of the most recent amendment to the Fund's registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, there have been (i) no
material changes in the Fund's investment objectives or policies, (ii) no
changes to the Fund's charter or by-laws that would delay or prevent a change
of control of the Fund, (iii) no material changes in the principal risk factors
associated with investment in the Fund, and (iv) no change to the persons
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio,
who are David Dowden, and Terrance Hults, each of whom is a Vice President of
the Fund.

ALLIANCE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT L.P.

Statement of Policies and Procedures for Proxy Voting

Introduction

As a registered investment adviser, Alliance Capital Management L.P. ("Alliance
Capital", "we" or "us") has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best
interests of our clients. We recognize that this duty requires us to vote
client securities in a timely manner and make voting decisions that are in the
best interests of our clients. Consistent with these obligations, we will
disclose our clients' voting records only to them and as required by mutual
fund vote disclosure regulations. In addition, the proxy committees may, after
careful consideration, choose to respond to surveys regarding past votes.

This statement is intended to comply with Rule 206(4)-6 of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. It sets forth our policies and procedures for voting
proxies for our discretionary investment advisory clients, including investment
companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This statement
applies to Alliance Capital's growth and value investment groups investing on
behalf of clients in both US and non-US securities.

Proxy Policies

This statement is designed to be responsive to the wide range of proxy voting
subjects that can have a significant effect on the investment value of the
securities held in our clients' accounts. These policies are not exhaustive due
to the variety of proxy voting issues that we may be required to consider.
Alliance Capital reserves the right to depart from these guidelines in order to
avoid voting decisions that we believe may be contrary to our clients' best
interests. In reviewing proxy issues, we will apply the following general
policies:

Corporate Governance: Alliance Capital's proxy voting policies recognize the
importance of good corporate governance in ensuring that management and the
board of directors fulfill their obligations to the shareholders. We favor
proposals promoting transparency and accountability within a company. We will
vote for proposals providing for equal access to the proxy materials so that
shareholders can express their views on various proxy issues. We also support
the appointment of a majority of independent directors on key committees and
separating the positions of chairman and chief executive officer. Finally,
because we believe that good corporate governance requires shareholders to have
a meaningful voice in the affairs of the company, we will support non-binding
shareholder proposals that request that companies amend their by-laws to
provide that director nominees be elected by an affirmative vote of a majority
of the votes cast.

Elections of Directors: Unless there is a proxy fight for seats on the Board or
we determine that there are other compelling reasons for withholding votes for
directors, we will vote in favor of the management proposed slate of directors.
That said, we believe that directors have a duty to respond to shareholder
actions that have received significant shareholder support. We may withhold
votes for directors that fail to act on key issues such as failure to implement
proposals to declassify boards, failure to implement a majority vote
requirement, failure to submit a rights plan to a shareholder vote or failure
to act on tender offers where a majority of shareholders have tendered their
shares. In addition, we will withhold votes for directors who fail to attend at
least seventy-five percent of board meetings within a given year without a
reasonable excuse. Finally, we may withhold votes for directors of non-U.S.
issuers where there is insufficient information about the nominees disclosed in
the proxy statement.

Appointment of Auditors: Alliance Capital believes that the company remains in
the best position to choose the auditors and will generally support
management's recommendation. However, we recognize that there may be inherent
conflicts when a company's independent auditor performs substantial non-audit
related services for the company. Although we recognize that there may be
special circumstances that could lead to high levels of non-audit fees in some
years, we would normally consider non-audit fees in excess of 70% of total fees
paid to the auditing firm to be disproportionate. Therefore, absent unique
circumstances, we may vote against the appointment of auditors if the fees for
non-audit related services exceed 70% of the total fees paid by the company to
the auditing firm or there are other reasons to question the independence of
the company's auditors.

Changes in Legal and Capital Structure: Changes in a company's charter,
articles of incorporation or by-laws are often technical and administrative in
nature. Absent a compelling reason to the contrary, Alliance Capital will cast
its votes in accordance with the company's management on such proposals.
However, we will review and analyze on a case-by-case basis any non-routine
proposals that are likely to affect the structure and operation of the company
or have a material economic effect on the company. For example, we will
generally support proposals to increase authorized common stock when it is
necessary to implement a stock split, aid in a restructuring or acquisition or
provide a sufficient number of shares for an employee savings plan, stock
option or executive compensation plan. However, a satisfactory explanation of a
company's intentions must be disclosed in the proxy statement for proposals
requesting an increase of greater than one hundred percent of the shares
outstanding. We will oppose increases in authorized common stock where there is
evidence that the shares will be used to implement a poison pill or another
form of anti-takeover device.

Corporate Restructurings, Mergers and Acquisitions: Alliance Capital believes
proxy votes dealing with corporate reorganizations are an extension of the
investment decision. Accordingly, we will analyze such proposals on a
case-by-case basis, weighing heavily the views of our research analysts that
cover the company and our investment professionals managing the portfolios in
which the stock is held.

Proposals Affecting Shareholder Rights: Alliance Capital believes that certain
fundamental rights of shareholders must be protected. We will generally vote in
favor of proposals that give shareholders a greater voice in the affairs of the
company and oppose any measure that seeks to limit those rights. However, when
analyzing such proposals we will weigh the financial impact of the proposal
against the impairment of shareholder rights.

Anti-Takeover Measures: Alliance Capital believes that measures that impede
corporate transactions such as takeovers or entrench management not only
infringe on the rights of shareholders but may also have a detrimental effect
on the value of the company. We will generally oppose proposals, regardless of
whether they are advanced by management or shareholders, the purpose or effect
of which is to entrench management or excessively or inappropriately dilute
shareholder ownership. Conversely, we support proposals that would restrict or
otherwise eliminate anti-takeover or anti-shareholder measures that have
already been adopted by corporate issuers. For example, we will support
shareholder proposals that seek to require the company to submit a shareholder
rights plan to a shareholder vote. We will evaluate, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals to completely redeem or eliminate such plans. Furthermore, we will
generally oppose proposals put forward by management (including the
authorization of blank check preferred stock, classified boards and
supermajority vote requirements) that appear to be anti-shareholder or intended
as management entrenchment mechanisms.

Executive Compensation: Alliance Capital believes that company management and
the compensation committee of the board of directors should, within reason, be
given latitude to determine the types and mix of compensation and benefit
awards offered to company employees. Whether proposed by a shareholder or
management, we will review proposals relating to executive compensation plans
on a case-by-case basis to ensure that the long-term interests of management
and shareholders are properly aligned. In general, we will analyze the proposed
plans to ensure that shareholder equity will not be excessively diluted. With
regard to stock award or option plans, we consider whether the option exercise
prices are below the market price on the date of grant and whether an
acceptable number of employees are eligible to participate in such programs. We
will generally oppose plans that have below market value exercise prices on the
date of issuance or permit repricing of underwater stock options without
shareholder approval. Other factors such as the company's performance and
industry practice will generally be factored into our analysis. We will support
proposals requiring managements to submit severance packages that exceed 2.99
times the sum of an executive officer's base salary plus bonus that are
triggered by a change in control to a shareholder vote. Finally, we will
support shareholder proposals requiring companies to expense stock options
because we view them as a large corporate expense that should be appropriately
accounted for.

Social and Corporate Responsibility: Alliance Capital will review and analyze
on a case-by-case basis proposals relating to social, political and
environmental issues to determine whether they will have a financial impact on
shareholder value. We will vote against proposals that are unduly burdensome or
result in unnecessary and excessive costs to the company. We may abstain from
voting on social proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial
impact on shareholder value.

Proxy Voting Procedures

Proxy Voting Committees

Our growth and value investment groups have formed separate proxy voting
committees to establish general proxy policies for Alliance Capital and
consider specific proxy voting matters as necessary. These committees
periodically review these policies and new types of corporate governance
issues, and decide how we should vote on proposals not covered by these
policies. When a proxy vote cannot be clearly decided by an application of our
stated policy, the proxy committee will evaluate the proposal. In addition, the
committees, in conjunction with the analyst that covers the company, may
contact corporate management and interested shareholder groups and others as
necessary to discuss proxy issues. Members of the committee include senior
investment personnel and representatives of the Legal and Compliance
Department. The committees may also evaluate proxies where we face a potential
conflict of interest (as discussed below). Finally, the committees monitor
adherence to these policies.

Conflicts of Interest

Alliance Capital recognizes that there may be a potential conflict of interest
when we vote a proxy solicited by an issuer whose retirement plan we manage, or
we administer, who distributes Alliance Capital sponsored mutual funds, or with
whom we or an employee has another business or personal relationship that may
affect how we vote on the issuer's proxy. Similarly, Alliance may have a
potential material conflict of interest when deciding how to vote on a proposal
sponsored or supported by a shareholder group that is a client. We believe that
centralized management of proxy voting, oversight by the proxy voting
committees and adherence to these policies ensures that proxies are voted with
only our clients' best interests in mind. Additionally, we have implemented
procedures to ensure that our votes are not the product of a material conflict
of interests, including: (i) on an annual basis, the proxy committees will take
reasonable steps to evaluate the nature of Alliance Capital's and our
employees' material business and personal relationships (and those of our
affiliates) with any company whose equity securities are held in client
accounts and any client that has sponsored or has material interest in a
proposal upon which we will be eligible to vote; (ii) requiring anyone involved
in the decision making process to disclose to the chairman of the appropriate
proxy committee any potential conflict that they are aware of (including
personal relationships) and any contact that they have had with any interested
party regarding a proxy vote; (iii) prohibiting employees involved in the
decision making process or vote administration from revealing how we intend to
vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested
parties; and (iv) where a material conflict of interests exists, reviewing our
proposed vote by applying a series of objective tests and, where necessary,
considering the views of third party research services to ensure that our
voting decision is consistent with our clients' best interests.

Because under certain circumstances Alliance Capital considers the
recommendation of third party research services, the proxy committees will take
reasonable steps to verify that any third party research service is in fact
independent based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. This includes
reviewing the third party research service's conflict management procedures and
ascertaining, among other things, whether the third party research service (i)
has the capacity and competency to adequately analyze proxy issues; and (ii)
can make such recommendations in an impartial manner and in the best interests
of our clients.

Proxies of Certain Non-US Issuers

Proxy voting in certain countries requires "share blocking." Shareholders
wishing to vote their proxies must deposit their shares shortly before the date
of the meeting (usually one-week) with a designated depositary. During this
blocking period, shares that will be voted at the meeting cannot be sold until
the meeting has taken place and the shares are returned to the clients'
custodian banks. Absent compelling reasons to the contrary, Alliance Capital
believes that the benefit to the client of exercising the vote does not
outweigh the cost of voting (i.e. not being able to sell the shares during this
period). Accordingly, if share blocking is required we generally abstain from
voting those shares.

In addition, voting proxies of issuers in non-US markets may give rise to a
number of administrative issues that may prevent Alliance Capital from voting
such proxies. For example, Alliance Capital may receive meeting notices without
enough time to fully consider the proxy or after the cut-off date for voting.
Other markets require Alliance Capital to provide local agents with power of
attorney prior to implementing Alliance Capital's voting instructions. Although
it is Alliance Capital's policy to seek to vote all proxies for securities held
in client accounts for which we have proxy voting authority, in the case of
non-US issuers, we vote proxies on a best efforts basis.

Loaned Securities

Many clients of Alliance Capital have entered into securities lending
arrangements with agent lenders to generate additional revenue. Alliance
Capital will not be able to vote securities that are on loan under these types
of arrangements. However, under rare circumstances, for voting issues that may
have a significant impact on the investment, we may request that clients recall
securities that are on loan if we determine that the benefit of voting
outweighs the costs and lost revenue to the client or fund and the
administrative burden of retrieving the securities.

Exhibit 12 (a)(1)

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.   Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

     The AllianceBernstein Mutual Fund Complex's code of ethics (this "Code")
for the investment companies within the complex (collectively, the "Funds" and
each, a "Company") applies to each Company's Principal Executive Officer,
Principal Financial and Accounting Officer and Controller (the "Covered
Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

* honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;


* full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the
Company;

* compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

* the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
person or persons identified in the Code; and

* accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

     Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Company. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member
of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position
with the Company.  For the purposes of this Code, members of the Covered
Officer's family include his or her spouse, children, stepchildren, financial
dependents, parents and stepparents.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The Company's
and the investment adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and
procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers
are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes that the
Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally
for the Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing
policies and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the
adviser and the Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such
activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and
the adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of
their duties as officers of the Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with
the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act,
such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it
is recognized by the Company's Board of Directors or Trustees (the "Directors")
that the Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more of
the other Funds or of other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

     Each Covered Officer must:

* not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Company whereby
the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Company;

* not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of
the Company;

* not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others to trade
personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions;

     There are some conflict of interest situations, whether involving a
Covered Officer directly or a member of his family, that should always be
discussed with the General Counsel of Alliance Capital Management L.P.(the
"General Counsel"), if material. Examples of these include:

* service as a director on the board of directors or trustees of any public or
private company (other than a not-for-profit organization);

* the receipt of any non-nominal gifts;

* the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the Company has
current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not
so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

* any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship with,
any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment adviser,
principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person thereof;

* a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges
or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio transactions or for
selling or redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the Covered
Officer's employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III. Disclosure and Compliance

* Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
requirements and disclosure controls and procedures generally applicable to the
Company;

* each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or outside the
Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors, and to governmental
regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

* each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds and the
adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Funds file with, or
submit to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds; and

* it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with
the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
regulations.


IV.  Reporting and Accountability

     Each Covered Officer must:

* upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the General Counsel that he has
received, read, and understands the Code;

* annually thereafter affirm to the General Counsel that he has complied with
the requirements of the Code;

* complete at least annually a questionnaire relating to affiliations or other
relationships that may give rise to conflicts of interest;

* not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
Company or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
are made in good faith; and

* notify the General Counsel promptly if he knows of any violation of this
Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, waivers sought by a
Covered Officer will be considered by the Company's Audit Committee (the
"Committee").

     The Company will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

* the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
potential violations reported to him;

* if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no material
violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take any further
action;

* any matter that the General Counsel believes is a material violation will be
reported to the Committee;

* if the Committee concurs that a material violation has occurred, it will
inform and make a recommendation to the Directors, who will consider
appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications
to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel
of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the
Covered Officer;

* the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and

* any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    Other Policies and Procedures

      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Company for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Company, the Company's adviser, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, it
is understood that this Code is in all respects separate and apart from, and
operates independently of, any such policies and procedures. In particular, the
Company's and its investment adviser's and principal underwriter's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act are separate
requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of
this Code.

VI.   Amendments

      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Directors, including a majority
of independent directors.

VII.  Confidentiality

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Directors, the investment adviser, their
counsel, counsel to the Company and, if deemed appropriate by the Directors of
the Company, to the Directors of the other Funds.

VIII. Internal Use

      The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
