PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE


DEAR SHAREHOLDER:
The US bond market continued to reward investors with solid returns for the
period covered by this report. As key economic indicators sent mixed signals,
the US economy continued to struggle and interest rates declined. In November,
the Federal Reserve Board lowered a key short-term interest rate--the federal
funds rate--to 1.25%, a new low.1 The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell
to a 45-year low of 3.3% near the end of the period. Although the environment
was favorable to bonds, declining interest rates and relatively low inflation
raised the fear that deflation, which hasn't been seen since the 1930s, would
return.

Bonds reported gains across all sectors. Leadership rotated from higher quality
bonds, which were the top performers in the previous period, to lower quality
bonds. However, in the municipal sector, higher quality bonds outperformed
high-yield issues. Taxable corporate and high-yield bonds also rebounded as
investors became more willing to take on risk.

The following report will provide you with more detailed information about the
trust's performance and the investment strategies used by portfolio manager
Maureen Newman. For more information, please contact your financial advisor.

CONSOLIDATION AND A NEW NAME: COLUMBIA
On April 1, 2003, six of the asset management firms brought together when
Columbia Management Group, Inc. was formed were consolidated and renamed
Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. (Columbia Management). This consolidation
does not affect the management or investment objectives of your trust and is the
next step in our efforts to create a consistent identity and to streamline our
organization. Although the name of the asset manager familiar to you has
changed, what hasn't changed is the commitment of our specialized investment
teams to a multi-disciplined approach to investing, focused on our goal of
offering shareholders the best products and services.

As always, we thank you for choosing Colonial Investment Grade Municipal Trust
and for giving us the opportunity to help you build a strong financial future.

/s/ Joseph R. Palombo

PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT


For the six-month period ended May 31, 2003, Colonial Investment Grade Municipal
Trust returned 10.14%, based on net asset value. The trust did better than its
peer group, the Lipper General Municipal Debt Funds (Leveraged) Category, which
averaged a return of 9.31% for the same period.1

Municipal bonds, especially high-grade insured issues, rose in value as
disappointing economic news and rising jobless claims drove interest rates
lower. The trust benefited from its stake in zero coupon municipal bonds, which
did especially well. Zero coupon bonds pay no interest and are purchased at a
steep discount. These bonds appreciate to face value at maturity. They tend to
outperform when interest rates are falling. The trust's preferred shares, which
represent about one-third of total assets, also helped performance. The trust
used the leverage provided by its preferred shares to invest in longer-term
bonds that earned higher income than the short-term variable rate that the
preferred shares paid out. US Airways bonds posted strong gains, while United
Airlines (0.4% and 0.1% of net assets, respectively) and tobacco bonds
faltered.2 Deterring performance to some extent were short positions in US
Treasury futures contracts, which are employed to reduce the overall duration of
the trust.

About 90% of the trust's assets remained in investment grade issues. New
additions included utilities such as Portland General, Pacificorp, and North
Carolina Eastern Municipal Power (0.1%, 0.3% and 0.2% of net assets,
respectively). These bonds offered attractive yields and relatively short
maturities. We slowed our buying in health care, where cutbacks in Medicaid
reimbursements have hurt nursing home and hospital bonds. To keep the trust's
yield strong, we also added small positions in various high-yield,
non-investment grade bonds.

We expect bonds to do well as the economy slowly recovers and inflation remains
tame. Demand will most likely remain strong for municipal bonds, which ended the
period looking attractively priced compared to US Treasuries. We plan to remain
focused on essential services bonds, which are backed by revenues from user
fees. We also expect to continue to add small stakes in high-yield issues.

1  Lipper Inc., a widely respected data provider in the industry, calculates
   an average total return for mutual funds with similar investment objectives
   as those of the trust.

2  Holdings are disclosed as of May 31, 2003, and are subject to change.

Past performance is no guarantee of future investment results. The principal
value and investment returns will fluctuate, resulting in a gain or loss on
sale.

Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-free income, but it also involves
certain risks. The value of the trust shares will be affected by interest rate
changes and the creditworthiness of issues held in the trust. Investing in high
yield securities offers the potential for high current income and attractive
total return, but involves certain risks. Lower-rated bond risks include default
of the issuer and rising interest rates. Interest income from certain tax-exempt
bonds may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals and
corporations.

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION:
Colonial Investment Grade Municipal Trust (the "Trust") is a Massachusetts
business trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Act"),
as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The
Trust's investment goal is to seek as high a level of after-tax total return as
is consistent with prudent risk, by pursuing current income generally exempt
from ordinary federal income tax and opportunities for long-term appreciation
from a portfolio primarily invested in investment grade municipal bonds. The
Trust is authorized to issue an unlimited number of common shares of beneficial
interest and 2,400 Auction Preferred Shares ("APS").

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

SECURITY VALUATION AND TRANSACTIONS:
Debt securities generally are valued by a pricing service based upon market
transactions for normal, institutional-size trading units of similar securities.
Such services may use various pricing techniques which take into account
appropriate factors such as yield, quality, coupon rate, maturity, type of
issue, trading characteristics and other data, as well as broker quotes. When
management deems it appropriate, an over-the-counter or exchange bid quotation
is used.

Options are valued at the last sale price, or in the absence of a sale, the mean
between the last quoted bid and asking price.

Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day by the
board of trade or exchange on which they are traded.

Short-term obligations with a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost.

Investments for which market quotations are not readily available, or quotations
which management believes are not appropriate, are valued at fair value under
procedures approved by the Board of Trustees.

Security transactions are accounted for on the date the securities are
purchased, sold or mature.

Cost is determined and gains (losses) are based upon the specific identification
method for both financial statement and federal income tax purposes.

The Trust may trade securities on other than normal settlement terms. This may
increase the risk if the other party to the transaction fails to deliver and
causes the Trust to subsequently invest at less advantageous prices.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:
Consistent with the Trust's policy to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to distribute all of its taxable and tax-exempt income, no federal income
tax has been accrued.

INTEREST INCOME, DEBT DISCOUNT AND PREMIUM:
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Premium and discount are being
amortized and accreted, respectively, for all debt securities.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:
Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the ex-date.

Distributions to preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at
the end of each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the APS is
generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for the APS on May 31, 2003
was 1.19%. For the six months ended May 31, 2003, the Trust declared dividends
to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $337,005 representing an average
APS dividend rate of 1.13%.

NOTE 2. FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

The following capital loss carryforwards, determined as of November 30, 2002,
are available to reduce taxable income arising from future net realized gains on
investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue Code:

              YEAR OF                 CAPITAL LOSS
            EXPIRATION                CARRYFORWARD
            ----------                ------------
               2003                    $  172,808
               2004                     1,454,485
               2008                     3,464,384
               2010                     1,238,884
                                       ----------
                                       $6,330,561

3. FEE AND COMPENSATION PAID TO AFFILIATES

MANAGEMENT FEE:
On April 1, 2003, Colonial Management Associates, Inc. ("Colonial"), the
previous investment advisor to the Trust merged into Columbia Management
Advisors, Inc. ("Columbia"), formerly known as Columbia Management Co., an
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation. At the
time of the merger, Columbia assumed the obligations of Colonial with respect to
the Trust. The merger did not change the way the Trust is managed, the
investment personnel assigned to manage the Trust or the fees paid by the Trust
to Columbia.

Columbia is the investment advisor of the Trust and furnishes accounting and
other services and office facilities for a fee to be paid monthly at the annual
rate of 0.65% of the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets
applicable to the APS.

PRICING AND BOOKKEEPING FEES:
Columbia is responsible for providing pricing and bookkeeping services to the
Trust under a Pricing and Bookkeeping Agreement. Under a separate agreement (the
"Outsourcing Agreement"), Columbia has delegated those functions to State Street
Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"). Columbia pays fees to State Street
under the Outsourcing Agreement.

Under its pricing and bookkeeping agreement with the Trust, Columbia receives
from the Trust an annual flat fee of $10,000, paid monthly, and in any month
that the Trust's average weekly net assets, including assets applicable to the
APS, are more than $50 million, a monthly fee equal to the average weekly net
assets, including assets applicable to the APS, of the Trust for that month
multiplied by a fee rate that is calculated by taking into account the fees
payable to State Street under the Outsourcing Agreement. For the six months
ended May 31, 2003, the annualized net asset based fee rate was 0.033%. The
Trust also pays out-of-pocket costs for pricing services.

OTHER:
The Trust pays no compensation to its officers, all of whom are employees of
Columbia or its affiliates.

The Trust's Independent Trustees may participate in a deferred compensation plan
which may be terminated at any time. Obligations of the plan will be paid solely
out of the Trust's assets.

The Trust has an agreement with its custodian bank under which $158 of custody
fees were reduced by balance credits for the six months ended May 31, 2003. The
Trust could have invested a portion of the assets utilized in connection with
the expense offset arrangement in an income-producing asset if it had not
entered into such an agreement.

NOTE 4. PREFERRED SHARES
The Trust currently has outstanding 2,400 APS. The APS are redeemable at the
option of the Trust on any dividend payment date at the redemption price of
$25,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends accumulated on a daily
basis unpaid through the redemption date (whether or not such dividends have
been declared).

Under the Act, the Trust is required to maintain asset coverage of at least 200%
with respect to the APS as of the last business day of each month in which any
APS are outstanding. Additionally, the Trust is required to meet more stringent
asset coverage requirements under the terms of the APS Agreement and in
accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the APS' rating agencies. Should
these requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the APS not be
paid, the Trust may be restricted in its ability to declare dividends to common
shareholders or may be required to redeem certain of the APS. At May 31, 2003,
there were no such restrictions on the Trust.

NOTE 5. PORTFOLIO INFORMATION

INVESTMENT ACTIVITY:
For the six months ended May 31, 2003, purchases and sales of investments, other
than short-term obligations, were $13,930,136 and $18,180,098, respectively.

Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) at May 31, 2003, based on cost of
investments for federal income tax purposes, was:

   Gross unrealized appreciation                $22,989,528
   Gross unrealized depreciation                 (4,824,719)
                                                -----------
      Net unrealized appreciation               $18,164,809
                                                ===========

FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS:
The Trust may invest in municipal and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Trust
will invest in these instruments to hedge against the effects of changes in the
value of portfolio securities due to anticipated changes in interest rates
and/or market conditions, for duration management, or when the transactions are
economically appropriate to the reduction of risk inherent in the management of
the Trust and not for trading purposes. The use of futures contracts involves
certain risks, which include: (1) imperfect correlation between the price
movement of the instruments and the underlying securities, (2) inability to
close out positions due to different trading hours, or the temporary absence of
a liquid market, for either the instrument or the underlying securities, or (3)
an inaccurate prediction by Columbia of the future direction of interest rates.
Any of these risks may involve amounts exceeding the variation margin recorded
in the Trust's Statement of Assets and Liabilities at any given time.




13
<PAGE>


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

May 31, 2003 (Unaudited)


Upon entering into a futures contract, the Trust deposits cash or securities
with its custodian in an amount sufficient to meet the initial margin
requirement. Subsequent payments are made or received by the Trust equal to the
daily change in the contract value and are recorded as variation margin payable
or receivable and offset in unrealized gains or losses. The Trust recognizes a
realized gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires.

The Trust may write call and put options on futures it owns or in which it may
invest. Writing put options tends to increase the Trust's exposure to the
underlying instrument. Writing call options tends to decrease the Trust's
exposure to the underlying instrument. When the Trust writes a call or put
option, an amount equal to the premium received is recorded as a liability and
subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
written. Premiums received from writing options which expire are treated as
realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are exercised or
closed are added to the proceeds or offset against the amounts paid on the
underlying future transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. The Trust
as a writer of an option has no control over whether the underlying future may
be sold (call) or purchased (put) and as a result bears the market risk of an
unfavorable change in the price of the future underlying the written option.
There is the risk the Trust may not be able to enter into a closing transaction
because of an illiquid market.

The Trust may also purchase put and call options. Purchasing call options tends
to increase the Trust's exposure to the underlying instrument. Purchasing put
options tends to decrease the Trust's exposure to the underlying instrument. The
Trust pays a premium which is included in the Trust's Statement of Assets and
Liabilities as an investment and subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the
current value of the option. Premiums paid for purchasing options which expire
are treated as realized losses. The risk associated with purchasing put and call
options is limited to the premium paid. Premiums paid for purchasing options
which are exercised or closed are added to the amounts paid or offset against
the proceeds on the underlying future transaction to determine the realized gain
or loss.

Refer to the Trust's Investment Portfolio for a summary of open futures contacts
at May 31, 2003.

OTHER:
The Trust had greater than 10% of its net assets, at May 31, 2003, invested in
issuers located in New York and Texas.

There are certain risks arising from geographic concentration in any state.
Certain revenue or tax related events in a state may impair the ability of
certain issuers of municipal securities to pay principal and interest on their
obligations.

The Trust may focus its investments in certain industries, subjecting it to
greater risk than a trust that is more diversified.

   from 6.98% to 7.06% and increase the ratio of net investment income
   (adjusted for dividend payments to preferred shareholders) from 6.30% to
   6.38%. Per share data and ratios for periods prior to November 30, 2002

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN


COLONIAL INVESTMENT GRADE MUNICIPAL TRUST

Pursuant to the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all
shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
distributions reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Trust by
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan Agent") unless a shareholder elects to
receive cash. Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or
nominee will have distributions reinvested automatically by the broker or
nominee in additional shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided
by the broker or the nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions
in cash. If the service is not available, such distributions will be paid in
cash. Shareholders whose shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee
should contact the broker or nominee for details. All distributions to
shareholders who elect not to participate in the Plan will be paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder of record on the record date therefore by the
Plan Agent as the dividend disbursing agent.

Non-participants in the Plan will receive distributions in cash. Distributions
payable to participants in the Plan will be applied by the Plan Agent, acting as
agent for Plan participants, to the purchase of shares of the Trust. Such shares
will be purchased by the Plan Agent at the then current market price of such
shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for the
participants' accounts.

Participants in the Plan may withdraw from the Plan upon written notice to the
Plan Agent. When a participant withdraws from the Plan or upon termination of
the Plan as provided below, certificates for whole shares credited to his
account under the Plan will be issued and a cash payment will be made for any
fraction of a share credited to such account. A shareholder's notice of election
to withdraw from the Plan must be received by the Plan Agent before the record
date for a dividend in order to be given effect with respect to that dividend.

In the case of shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees holding shares
for others who are the beneficial owners of those shares, the Plan Agent will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to
time by the shareholder of record as representing the total amount registered in
such shareholder's name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are to
participate in the Plan.

There is no charge to Plan participants for reinvesting distributions. The Plan
Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of distributions will be paid
by the Trust. Each participant in the Plan will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's open market
purchases in connection with the reinvestment of distributions. Purchase orders
from the participants in the Plan may be combined with those of other
participants and the price paid by any particular participant may be the average
of the price paid on various orders executed on behalf of groups of participants
in the Plan.

The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve participants of any
income tax that may be payable on such dividends or distributions.

The Plan may be amended or terminated on 30 days' written notice to Plan
participants. All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., by mail at P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010, or by phone at 1-800-730-6001.

                    COLONIAL INVESTMENT GRADE MUNICIPAL TRUST

I, Joseph R. Palombo, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Colonial Investment Grade
     Municipal Trust;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the
     registrant and have:

     a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material
     information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated
     subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
     particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

     b) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
     procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this
     report (the "Evaluation Date"); and

     c) presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the
     disclosure controls and procedures based on our evaluation as of the
     Evaluation Date;

5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on
     our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
     committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
     equivalent functions):

     a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
     controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
     process, summarize, and report financial data and have identified for the
     registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and

     b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
     controls; and

6.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
     report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls
     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
     corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.
