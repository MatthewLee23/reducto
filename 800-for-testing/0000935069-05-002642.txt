                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.  The Gabelli Utility Trust (the "Trust") is a  non-diversified
closed-end management investment company organized as a Delaware statutory trust
on February 25, 1999 and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"), whose primary objective is long-term growth of capital
and income.  The Trust had no operations  prior to July 9, 1999,  other than the
sale of 10,000 shares of beneficial  interest for $100,000 to The Gabelli Equity
Trust Inc. (the "Equity  Trust") at $10.00 per share. On July 9, 1999, the Trust
had a 4 for 3 stock split  making the balance of Trust shares held by the Equity
Trust as 13,333.  On July 9, 1999, the Equity Trust  contributed  $79,487,260 in
cash and  securities  in exchange for shares of the Trust,  and on the same date
distributed  such shares to Equity Trust  shareholders of record on July 1, 1999
at the rate of one share of the Trust for every ten shares of the Equity  Trust.
Investment operations commenced on July 9, 1999.

      The Trust will invest 80% of its assets,  under normal market  conditions,
in common stocks and other securities of foreign and domestic companies involved
in  providing  products,  services  or  equipment  for  (i)  the  generation  or
distribution of electricity,  gas and water and (ii) telecommunications services
or infrastructure  operations (the "80% Policy").  The 80% Policy may be changed
without shareholder approval. However, the Trust has adopted a policy to provide
shareholders  with  notice at least 60 days prior to the  implementation  of any
change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted   accounting   principles   requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  The following is a summary of significant  accounting policies
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

      SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees (the "Board") so determines, by such other method as the Board
shall  determine  in good faith,  to reflect its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").

      Portfolio  securities  primarily  traded on foreign  markets are generally
valued at the preceding  closing values of such  securities on their  respective
exchanges or if after the close of the foreign  markets,  but prior to the close
of business on the day the securities are being valued, market conditions change
significantly,  certain  foreign  securities  may be  fair  valued  pursuant  to
procedures  established  by the  Board.  Debt  instruments  that are not  credit
impaired  with  remaining  maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost,  unless the Board  determines such does not reflect the  securities'  fair
value,  in which  case  these  securities  will be valued at their fair value as
determined by the Board. Debt instruments having a maturity greater than 60 days
for which  market  quotations  are  readily  available  are valued at the latest
average of the bid and asked  prices.  If there were no asked  prices  quoted on
such day, the security is valued using the closing bid price.  Futures contracts
are valued at the closing  settlement price of the exchange or board of trade on
which the applicable contract is traded.

      Securities  and  assets  for  which  market  quotations  are  not  readily
available  are  valued at their  fair value as  determined  in good faith  under
procedures  established by and under the general  supervision of the Board. Fair
valuation  methodologies  and  procedures  may include,  but are not limited to:
analysis and review of available financial and non-


                                        8

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

financial  information  about the  company;  comparisons  to the  valuation  and
changes in valuation of similar  securities,  including a comparison  of foreign
securities to the  equivalent  U.S.  dollar value ADR securities at the close of
the U.S.  exchange;  and  evaluation  of any  other  information  that  could be
indicative of the value of the security.

      REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. The Trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
primary  government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Board,
with member banks of the Federal Reserve System or with other brokers or dealers
that meet credit  guidelines  established  by the  Adviser  and  reviewed by the
Board.  Under the  terms of a  typical  repurchase  agreement,  the Trust  takes
possession  of an  underlying  debt  obligation  subject to an obligation of the
seller to repurchase,  and the Trust to resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon
price and time, thereby determining the yield during the Trust's holding period.
The Trust will always receive and maintain securities as collateral whose market
value, including accrued interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar
amount invested by the Trust in each agreement.  The Trust will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Trust may be delayed or limited.

      SWAP  AGREEMENTS.  The  Trust  may enter  into  interest  rate swap or cap
transactions.  The use of interest  rate swaps and caps is a highly  specialized
activity that involves  investment  techniques  and risks  different  from those
associated with ordinary  portfolio security  transactions.  In an interest rate
swap,  the Trust would agree to pay to the other party to the interest rate swap
(which is known as the  "counterparty")  periodically  a fixed  rate  payment in
exchange  for the  counterparty  agreeing  to pay to the  Trust  periodically  a
variable rate payment that is intended to approximate the Trust's  variable rate
payment obligation on the Series B Preferred Stock. In an interest rate cap, the
Trust  would  pay a  premium  to the  counterparty  and,  to the  extent  that a
specified variable rate index exceeds a predetermined  fixed rate, would receive
from the counterparty payments of the difference based on the notional amount of
such cap.  Interest rate swap and cap  transactions  introduce  additional  risk
because the Trust would remain  obligated to pay preferred  stock dividends when
due in  accordance  with the  Articles  Supplementary  even if the  counterparty
defaulted.  If there is a default by the  counterparty  to a swap contract,  the
Trust will be limited to contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related
to the transaction.  There is no assurance that the swap contract counterparties
will be able to meet their  obligations  pursuant to the swap contracts or that,
in the  event of  default,  the  Trust  will  succeed  in  pursuing  contractual
remedies. The Trust thus assumes the risk that it may be delayed in or prevented
from  obtaining  payments  owed  to it  pursuant  to  the  swap  contracts.  The
creditworthiness  of the swap contract  counterparties  is closely  monitored in
order to  minimize  this  risk.  Depending  on the  general  state of short term
interest rates and the returns on the Trust's portfolio securities at that point
in time,  such a default  could  negatively  affect the Trust's  ability to make
dividend payments for the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition,  at the time an
interest rate swap or cap transaction  reaches its scheduled  termination  date,
there  is a risk  that  the  Trust  will  not be able to  obtain  a  replacement
transaction or that the terms of the replacement  will not be as favorable as on
the expiring transaction. If this occurs, it could have a negative impact on the
Trust's ability to make dividend payments on the Series B Preferred Stock.

      The use of derivative  instruments involves, to varying degrees,  elements
of market risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      Unrealized  gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and unrealized
losses are reported as a liability on the  Statement of Assets and  Liabilities.
The  change in value of swaps,  including  the  accrual of  periodic  amounts of
interest to be paid or received  on swaps is  reported  as  unrealized  gains or
losses in the Statement of Operations.  A realized gain or loss is recorded upon
payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements. Swap
agreements  involve,  to varying  degrees,  elements of market and  counterparty
risk,  and  exposure to loss in excess of the related  amounts  reflected in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

      The Trust has entered into one interest rate swap  agreement with Citibank
N.A. Under the agreement the Trust receives a variable rate of interest and pays
a respective fixed rate of interest on the nominal value of the swap. Details of
the swap at June 30, 2005 are as follows:

*Based on Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate).

      FUTURES  CONTRACTS.  The Trust may  engage in  futures  contracts  for the
purpose of hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio  securities and
in the value of securities it intends to purchase. Such investments will only be
made if they are economically  appropriate to the reduction of risks involved in
the  management  of the  Trust's  investments.  Upon  entering  into  a  futures
contract,  the Trust is required to deposit with the broker an amount of cash or
cash equivalents equal to a certain  percentage of the contract amount.  This is
known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation margin") are made
or received by the Trust each day,  depending  on the daily  fluctuation  of the
value of the  contract.  The daily  changes  in the  contract  are  included  in
unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on investments and futures contracts. The
Trust  recognizes a realized  gain or loss when the contract is closed.  At June
30, 2005, there were no open futures contracts.

      There are several risks in connection with the use of futures contracts as
a hedging device. The change in value of futures contracts primarily corresponds
with the value of their underlying instruments, which may not correlate with the
change in value of the hedged  investments.  These  contracts may involve market
risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss  reflected  in the  Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. In addition, there is the risk that the Trust may not be
able to enter  into a  closing  transaction  because  of an  illiquid  secondary
market.

      FORWARD  FOREIGN  EXCHANGE  CONTRACTS.  The  Trust may  engage in  forward
foreign  exchange  contracts for hedging a specific  transaction with respect to
either the currency in which the transaction is denominated or another  currency
as deemed  appropriate by the Adviser.  Forward foreign  exchange  contracts are
valued at the forward rate and are marked-to-market  daily. The change in market
value is included in unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on  investments  and
foreign currency translations.  When the contract is closed, the Trust records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference  between the value of the contract
at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

      The  use  of  forward  foreign  exchange   contracts  does  not  eliminate
fluctuations in the underlying prices of the Trust's portfolio  securities,  but
it does  establish  a rate of  exchange  that  can be  achieved  in the  future.
Although  forward  foreign  exchange  contracts  limit the risk of loss due to a
decline in the value of the hedged currency,  they also limit any potential gain
that might result should the value of the currency increase. These contracts may
involve  market risk in excess of the  unrealized  gain or loss reflected in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.  In addition, the Trust could be exposed to
risks if the  counterparties  to the  contracts  are unable to meet the terms of
their  contracts.  At June 30, 2005, there were no open forward foreign exchange
contracts.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATIONS.  The books and  records  of the Trust are
maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies,  investments and
other assets and liabilities  are translated  into U.S.  dollars at the exchange
rates prevailing at the end of the period, and purchases and sales of investment
securities,  income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate  prevailing
on the respective dates of such transactions. Unrealized gains and losses, which
result from changes in foreign exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of
securities,  have  been  included  in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on
investments and foreign  currency  translations.  Net realized  foreign currency
gains and losses  resulting  from  changes in  exchange  rates  include  foreign
currency gains and losses  between trade date and settlement  date on investment
securities  transactions,  foreign  currency  transactions  and  the  difference
between the amounts of interest and dividends recorded on the books of the Trust
and the amounts  actually  received.  The portion of foreign  currency gains and
losses  related to  fluctuation in exchange rates between the initial trade date
and  subsequent  sale  trade  date  is  included  in  realized   gain/(loss)  on
investments.

      FOREIGN SECURITIES.  The Trust may directly purchase securities of foreign
issuers.  Investing in securities of foreign issuers  involves special risks not
typically  associated  with investing in securities of U.S.  issuers.  The risks
include  possible  revaluation of currencies,  the ability to repatriate  funds,
less complete financial  information about companies and possible future adverse
political  and  economic  developments.  Moreover,  securities  of many  foreign
issuers and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than
those of securities of comparable U.S. issuers.

      SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME. Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

      DIVIDENDS  AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions  to common
shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and
capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with Federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from that determined under U.S. generally accepted
accounting  principles.   These  differences  are  primarily  due  to  differing
treatments  of income and gains on  various  investment  securities  held by the
Trust, timing differences and differing  characterizations of distributions made
by the Trust.

      Distributions  to  Shareholders  of the Trust's 5.625% Series A Cumulative
Preferred   Stock  and  Series  B  Auction  Rate   Cumulative   Preferred  Stock
("Cumulative  Preferred Stock") are recorded on a daily basis and are determined
as described in Note 5.

      For the year  ended  December  31,  2004,  reclassifications  were made to
decrease accumulated  distributions in excess of net investment income by $3,970
and to  increase  accumulated  net  realized  loss on  investments  and  foreign
currency transactions by $3,970.

      The tax  character  of  distributions  paid  during the fiscal  year ended
December 31, 2004 was as follows:

      PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  The Trust intends to continue to qualify as a
regulated  investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code").  It is the policy of the Trust to comply with the
requirements  of the Code  applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to
distribute  substantially  all of its net investment  company taxable income and
net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.

      Dividends  and interest from  non-U.S.  sources  received by the Trust are
generally subject to non-U.S. withholding taxes at rates ranging up to 30%. Such
withholding  taxes may be reduced or  eliminated  under the terms of  applicable
U.S.  income tax treaties,  and the Trust  intends to undertake  any  procedural
steps required to claim the benefits of such treaties.

      As of December 31, 2004, the  components of accumulated  earnings/(losses)
on a tax basis were as follows:

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Trust has entered into an
investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory  Agreement") with the Adviser which
provides  that the Trust will pay the  Adviser a fee,  computed  weekly and paid
monthly,  equal on an annual  basis to 1.00% of the value of its average  weekly
net assets  including the  liquidation  value of preferred  stock. In accordance
with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous  investment
program for the Trust's portfolio and oversees the administration of all aspects
of the  Trust's  business  and  affairs.  The  Adviser  has agreed to reduce the
management  fee  on  the  incremental  assets  attributable  to  the  Cumulative
Preferred  Stock if the total return of the net asset value of the Common Shares
of the Trust,  including  distributions  and advisory fee subject to  reduction,
does not exceed the stated  dividend rate of the Cumulative  Preferred Stock for
the fiscal year.

      The Trust's  total  return on the net asset value of the Common  Shares is
monitored on a monthly basis to assess whether the total return on the net asset
value of the Common Shares exceeds the stated  dividend rate of each  particular
series of Cumulative  Preferred  Stock for the period.  For the six months ended
June 30,  2005,  the Trust's  total  return on the net asset value of the Common
Shares  exceeded the stated dividend rate or net swap expense of all outstanding
Preferred Stock. Thus, management fees were accrued on these assets.

      During  the six  months  ended  June 30,  2005,  Gabelli &  Company,  Inc.
("Gabelli  &  Company"),  an  affiliate  of the  Adviser,  received  $57,404  in
brokerage  commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio
securities on behalf of the Trust.

      In  connection  with the  2004  Rights  Offering  ("Rights"),  holders  of
unexercised  rights to purchase Common Shares of the Trust were able to instruct
the  Subscription  Agent  (EquiServe Trust Company) to sell such Rights on their
behalf.  The  Subscription  Agent was  permitted  to effect  such sales  through
Gabelli & Company,  unless the Subscription  Agent was able to negotiate a lower
commission  rate with an independent  broker.  Total  commissions  from sales of
Rights effected by the Subscription  Agent through Gabelli & Company amounted to
$21,882 for the year ended December 31, 2004.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

      The cost of  calculating  the Trust's net asset value per share is a Trust
expense pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. During the six months ended June 30,
2005, the Trust  reimbursed the Adviser  $22,500 in connection  with the cost of
computing  the Trust's  net asset  value,  which is  included  in  miscellaneous
expenses in the Statement of Operations.

      The Trust is  assuming  its portion of the  allocated  cost of the Gabelli
Funds' Chief Compliance Officer in the amount of $2,936 for the six months ended
June 30,  2005  which is  included  in  payroll  expenses  in the  Statement  of
Operations.

4.  PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES.  Cost of  purchases  and  proceeds  from the sales of
securities,  other than short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30,
2005 aggregated $50,760,811 and $8,553,942, respectively.

5. CAPITAL. The charter permits the Trust to issue an unlimited number of shares
of beneficial interest (par value $0.001). The Board of the Trust has authorized
the repurchase of its shares on the open market when the shares are trading at a
discount  of 10% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board may  determine
from time to time) from the net asset value of the shares. During the six months
ended June 30,  2005,  the Trust did not  repurchase  any  shares of  beneficial
interest in the open market.

      Transactions in shares of beneficial interest were as follows:

      The Trust's  Articles of  Incorporation  authorize  the  issuance of up to
2,005,000 shares of $0.001 par value Cumulative  Preferred Stock. The Cumulative
Preferred  Stock is senior to the  Common  Shares and  results in the  financial
leveraging of the Common Shares. Such leveraging tends to magnify both the risks
and opportunities to common shareholders.  Dividends on shares of the Cumulative
Preferred Stock are cumulative. The Trust is required by the 1940 Act and by the
Articles  Supplementary to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. If the Trust fails to meet these  requirements and
does not correct such failure,  the Trust may be required to redeem,  in part or
in full,  the 5.625%  Series A and Series B Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock at a redemption price of $25.00 and $25,000,  respectively, per share plus
an amount equal to the accumulated and unpaid dividends  whether or not declared
on such  shares in order to meet these  requirements.  Additionally,  failure to
meet the  foregoing  asset  coverage  requirements  could  restrict  the Trust's
ability  to pay  dividends  to common  shareholders  and could  lead to sales of
portfolio  securities at inopportune  times.  The income received on the Trust's
assets may vary in a manner  unrelated  to the fixed and variable  rates,  which
could have either a beneficial or detrimental  impact on net  investment  income
and gains available to common shareholders.

      On August 20, 2003, the Trust distributed one transferable  right for each
of the 15,298,490  Common Shares  outstanding to  shareholders of record on that
date. Three rights were required to purchase one additional  common share at the
subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders  who exercised  their full
primary  subscription  rights were eligible for an  over-subscription  privilege
entitling  them to  subscribe,  subject  to certain  limitations  and a pro-rata
allotment,  for any  additional  shares not  purchased  pursuant  to the primary
subscription  plus  such  additional  amounts  as  authorized  by the  Board  in
accordance with the registration  statement.  The subscription period expired on
September 25, 2003. The rights

offering  was fully and  over-subscribed  resulting in the issuance of 7,500,000
Common Shares and proceeds of $52,500,000  to the Trust,  prior to the deduction
of  expenses  of  $534,089.  The net asset  value per share of the Trust  common
shareholders  was enhanced by  approximately  $0.12 per share as a result of the
issuance of shares above net asset value.

      On October 20, 2004, the Trust distributed one transferable right for each
of the 23,118,091  Common Shares  outstanding to  shareholders of record on that
date.  Four rights were required to purchase one additional  common share at the
subscription  price of $7.00 per share.  Shareholders  who exercised  their full
primary  subscription  rights were eligible for an  over-subscription  privilege
entitling  them to  subscribe,  subject  to certain  limitations  and a pro-rata
allotment,  for any  additional  shares not  purchased  pursuant  to the primary
subscription  plus  such  additional  amounts  as  authorized  by the  Board  in
accordance with the registration  statement.  The subscription period expired on
November 24, 2004. The rights  offering was fully  subscribed,  having  received
over-subscription  requests  in  excess  of the  shares  available  for  primary
subscription  resulting in the issuance of 5,779,546  Common Shares and proceeds
of  $40,456,822  to the Trust,  prior to the deduction of estimated  expenses of
$475,000.  The net asset value per share of the Trust  common  shareholders  was
reduced by  approximately  $0.06 per share as a result of the issuance of shares
below net asset value.

      On July 31, 2003, the Trust  received net proceeds of  $28,877,500  (after
underwriting  discounts of $945,000 and offering  expenses of $169,949) from the
public  offering of 1,200,000  shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock.  Commencing July 31, 2008 and thereafter,  the Trust, at its option,  may
redeem the 5.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock in whole or in part at the
redemption  price at any time.  During the six months ended June 30,  2005,  the
Trust did not  repurchase  any shares of 5.625%  Series A  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. All repurchased shares of 5.625% Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock have
been  retired.  At June  30,  2005,  1,184,200  shares  of the  5.625%  Series A
Cumulative  Preferred Stock were outstanding and accrued  dividends  amounted to
$18,503.

      On July 31, 2003, the Trust  received net proceeds of  $24,572,500  (after
underwriting  discounts of $250,000 and offering  expenses of $169,949) from the
public  offering of 1,000 shares of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred
Stock. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, which is generally held
every 7 days, is expected to vary with short-term  interest rates.  The dividend
rates of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred Stock ranged from 2.24% to
3.41% for the six months ended June 30, 2005.  Existing  shareholders may submit
an order to hold, bid or sell such shares on each auction date. Series B Auction
Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  shareholders  may also  trade  shares in the
secondary market. The Trust, at its option, may redeem the Series B Auction Rate
Cumulative  Preferred  Stock in whole or in part at the redemption  price at any
time.  During the six months ended June 30,  2005,  the Trust did not redeem any
shares of Series B Auction Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock. At June 30, 2005,
1,000  shares of the  Series B Auction  Rate  Cumulative  Preferred  Stock  were
outstanding  with an  annualized  dividend  rate of 3.41% per share and  accrued
dividends amounted to $4,736.

      The holders of Cumulative Preferred Stock have voting rights equivalent to
those of the  holders  of  Common  Shares  (one  vote per  share)  and will vote
together with holders of Common Shares as a single class. In addition,  the 1940
Act  requires  that along with  approval  of a majority of the holders of common
stock,  approval  of a  majority  of the  holders of any  outstanding  shares of
Cumulative  Preferred Stock,  voting separately as a class, would be required to
(a) adopt any plan of reorganization  that would adversely affect the Cumulative
Preferred Stock,  and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security  holders,
including,  among other things,  changes in the Trust's  subclassification  as a
closed-end   investment  company  or  changes  in  its  fundamental   investment
restrictions.

6. INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION.  Because the Trust primarily invests in common stocks
and other securities of foreign and domestic  companies in the utility industry,
its  portfolio  may be subject to greater  risk and market  fluctuations  than a
portfolio of securities representing a broad range of investments.

7. OTHER MATTERS. The Adviser and/or affiliates have received subpoenas from the
Attorney General of the State of New York and the SEC requesting  information on
mutual fund  shares  trading  practices.  Gabelli  Asset  Management  Inc.,  the
Adviser's  parent  company,  is responding  to these  requests for documents and
testimony.  The Trust does not believe  that these  matters will have a material
adverse  effect  on  the  Trust's  financial  position  or  the  results  of its
operations.

8.  INDEMNIFICATIONS.  The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of
indemnifications.  The Trust's  maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is
unknown. However, the Trust has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST

           BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At its meeting on February  16,  2005,  the Board of Trustees  ("Board")  of the
Trust approved the  continuation of the investment  advisory  agreement with the
Adviser for the Trust on the basis of the  recommendation  by the trustees  (the
"independent  trustees")  who are not  "interested  persons"  of the Trust.  The
following  paragraphs  summarize the material information and factors considered
by the  independent  trustees  as well as  their  conclusions  relative  to such
factors.

NATURE,  EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES.  The  independent  trustees  considered
information  regarding the portfolio  manager and supporting  team, the depth of
the analyst pool available to the Adviser and the portfolio  manager,  the scope
of administrative,  shareholder and other services supervised or provided by the
Adviser and the absence of significant  service problems  reported to the Board.
The independent directors noted the experience, length of service and reputation
of the portfolio manager.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The independent directors reviewed the short, medium and
long-term  performance of the Trust against a peer group of utility  funds.  The
trustees  noted that the Trust's  performance  was in or near the top 40% of the
funds in its category for all relevant periods.

PROFITABILITY.  The  independent  trustees  reviewed  summary data regarding the
profitability of the Trust to the Adviser both with an  administrative  overhead
charge and without  such a charge.  The trustees  also noted that a  substantial
portion of the Trust's  portfolio  transactions  were  executed by an affiliated
broker and that the Adviser  received a moderate  level of soft dollar  research
benefits through the Trust's portfolio brokerage.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The independent  trustees determined that economies of scale
were unlikely to be an issue for a closed-end fund such as the Trust.

SHARING  OF  ECONOMIES  OF  SCALE.  The  independent  trustees  noted  that  the
investment  management fee schedule for the Trust does not take into account any
potential economies of scale.

SERVICE AND COST  COMPARISONS.  The  independent  trustees  compared the expense
ratios of the  investment  management  fee, other expenses and total expenses of
the Trust to similar expense ratios of the peer group of utility funds and noted
that the Adviser's  management  fee includes  substantially  all  administrative
services of the Trust as well as  investment  advisory  services.  The  trustees
noted that the Trust's  expense  ratios were  higher  than  average  within this
group.  The trustees also noted that the basic  management fee structure was the
same as that in effect for most of the  Gabelli  funds but that the  Adviser did
not charge a fee on assets  supported  by  leverage  except to the  extent  that
performance of the Trust was positive after deducting the costs of leverage. The
trustees  did not  compare  the  management  fee to the fee for  other  types of
accounts managed by the Adviser.

CONCLUSIONS.  The independent  trustees  concluded that the Trust enjoyed highly
experienced  portfolio  management  services,  good  ancillary  services  and an
excellent  performance record. The independent  trustees also concluded that the
Trust's  expense  ratios and the  profitability  to the Adviser of managing  the
Trust were  reasonable,  particularly in light of the Trust's  performance,  and
that  economies of scale were not a factor in their  thinking.  The trustees did
not view the potential  profitability of ancillary services as material to their
decision.  On the basis of the foregoing and without assigning particular weight
to any single  conclusion,  the  independent  trustees  determined  to recommend
continuation  of the  investment  management  agreement  to the  full  Board  of
Trustees.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLANS

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

      It is the Policy of The Gabelli Utility Trust  ("Trust") to  automatically
reinvest dividends payable to common shareholders. As a "registered" shareholder
you  automatically  become  a  participant  in the  Trust's  Automatic  Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan authorizes the Trust to issue shares to
participants upon an income dividend or a capital gains distribution  regardless
of whether the shares are trading at a discount or a premium to net asset value.
All distributions to shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names
will be automatically  reinvested  pursuant to the Plan in additional  shares of
the Trust.  Plan  participants  may send their stock  certificates  to EquiServe
Trust  Co.  ("EquiServe")  to be held in their  dividend  reinvestment  account.
Registered  shareholders  wishing to  receive  their  distribution  in cash must
submit this request in writing to:

                            The Gabelli Utility Trust
                                  c/o EquiServe
                                  P.O.Box 43010
                            Providence, RI 02940-3010

      Shareholders  requesting this cash election must include the shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional questions regarding the Plan or requesting a copy of the terms of the
Plan may contact EquiServe at (800) 336-6983.

      SHAREHOLDERS WISHING TO LIQUIDATE REINVESTED SHARES held at EquiServe must
do so in  writing  or by  telephone.  Please  submit  your  request to the above
mentioned  address  or  telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,
address  and  account  number.  The  cost  to  liquidate  shares  is  $2.50  per
transaction as well as the brokerage commission incurred.  Brokerage charges are
expected to be less than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

      If your  shares  are held in the name of a broker,  bank or  nominee,  you
should contact such institution. If such institution is not participating in the
Plan,  your  account  will  be  credited  with  a cash  dividend.  In  order  to
participate in the Plan through such institution, it may be necessary for you to
have your shares taken out of "street name" and  re-registered in your own name.
Once  registered  in  your  own  name  your  dividends  will  be   automatically
reinvested. Certain brokers participate in the Plan. Shareholders holding shares
in "street name" at participating institutions will have dividends automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

      The number of Common Shares  distributed  to  participants  in the Plan in
lieu of cash  dividends is determined in the following  manner.  Under the Plan,
whenever  the market price of the Trust's  Common  Shares is equal to or exceeds
net asset value at the time shares are valued for  purposes of  determining  the
number of shares equivalent to the cash dividends or capital gains distribution,
participants are issued Common Shares valued at the greater of (i) the net asset
value as most recently  determined or (ii) 95% of the then current  market price
of the Trust's Common Shares. The valuation date is the dividend or distribution
payment date or, if that date is not a New York Stock Exchange  trading day, the
next  trading  day. If the net asset  value of the Common  Shares at the time of
valuation  exceeds  the market  price of the Common  Shares,  participants  will
receive Common Shares from the Trust valued at market price. If the Trust should
declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable only in cash, EquiServe
will buy Common Shares in the open market,  or on the New York Stock Exchange or
elsewhere,  for the participants' accounts,  except that EquiServe will endeavor
to terminate purchases in the open market and cause the Trust to issue shares at
net asset value if,  following the  commencement of such  purchases,  the market
value of the Common  Shares  exceeds the then  current net asset  value.

      The automatic  reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions
will not  relieve  participants  of any  income tax which may be payable on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

      The Trust  reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to
any  voluntary  cash  payments  made  and  any  dividend  or  distribution  paid
subsequent  to written  notice of the change  sent to the members of the Plan at
least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended or  terminated  by  EquiServe  on at least 90 days'  written
notice to participants in the Plan.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

      The  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan  is  yet  another   vehicle  for  our
shareholders to increase their  investment in the Trust. In order to participate
in the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Plan,  shareholders  must have  their  shares
registered in their own name.

      Participants in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional  cash payments to EquiServe for  investments in the Trust's shares at
the then  current  market  price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from $250 to
$10,000. EquiServe will use these funds to purchase shares in the open market on
or about the 1st and 15th of each month.  EquiServe will charge each shareholder
who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata share of the  brokerage  commissions.
Brokerage  charges  for such  purchases  are  expected to be less than the usual
brokerage charge for such transactions.  It is suggested that any voluntary cash
payments be sent to EquiServe,  P.O. Box 43010,  Providence,  RI 02940-3010 such
that EquiServe  receives such payments  approximately 10 days before the 1st and
15th of the month.  Funds not received at least five days before the  investment
date shall be held for investment until the next purchase date. A payment may be
withdrawn  without  charge if notice is received by  EquiServe at least 48 hours
before such payment is to be invested.

      For  more  information   regarding  the  Dividend  Reinvestment  Plan  and

4.   The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are  responsible for

     (d)  Disclosed  in this  report  any  change in the  registrant's  internal
          control  over  financial  reporting  that  occurred  during the second
          fiscal  quarter  of  the  period  covered  by  this  report  that  has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

          operation  of internal  control  over  financial  reporting  which are

          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  Any fraud, whether or not material,  that involves management or other
          employees who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's  internal
