(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST  PERFORMANCE  IS NO  GUARANTEE  OF  FUTURE  RESULTS.  Total  return  is
calculated  by  subtracting  the  value  of an  investment  in the  Fund  at the
beginning of each  specified  period from the value at the end of the period and
dividing the  remainder by the value of the  investment  at the beginning of the
period and expressing the result as a percentage.  The calculation  assumes that
all income  dividends  and capital gain  distributions  have been  reinvested at
prices obtained under the Fund's dividend  reinvestment  plan. Total return does
not reflect broker commissions or sales charges.  Total return for a period more
than one year  represents  the average  annual total return.  Total return for a
period of less than one year is not annualized.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.  Total
return,  price,  yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market
conditions.  This data is provided for information  only and is not intended for
trading purposes.  Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously
offered.  There is a  one-time  public  offering  and  once  issued,  shares  of
closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Net asset
value is total assets  applicable to common  shareholders less total liabilities
divided by the number of common  shares  outstanding.  Holdings  are  subject to
change daily.

(3) Dividend Yield is determined by dividing the annualized  current monthly per
share  dividend to common  shareholders  by the market price per common share at
December 31, 2004.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nicholas-Applegate  Convertible & Income Fund II (the "Fund") was organized as a
Massachusetts  business trust on April 22, 2003. Prior to commencing  operations
on July 31, 2003, the Fund had no operations  other than matters relating to its
organization and registration as a diversified, closed-end management investment
company under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940. PA Fund  Management LLC (the
"Investment  Manager"),  serves  as  the  Fund's  investment  manager  and is an
indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary of Allianz  Global  Investors of America L.P.
("Allianz  Global"),  formerly Allianz Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P.
Allianz Global is an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Fund
has an unlimited amount of $0.00001 par value common stock authorized.

The Fund  seeks to  provide  total  return  through  a  combination  of  capital
appreciation  and  high  current  income.  The Fund  attempts  to  achieve  this
objective  by  investing  in  a  portfolio   of   convertible   securities   and
non-convertible income-producing securities.

The  preparation  of the  financial  statements in  accordance  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
and  disclosures in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from
these estimates.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations  which provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is unknown as this would  involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet been asserted.
However, the Fund expects the risk of any loss to be remote.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund.

(A) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market quotations
are readily available are stated at market value. Portfolio securities and other
financial  instruments for which market  quotations are not readily available or
if a development/event  occurs that may impact the value of the security, may be
fair-valued  in good faith  pursuant to procedures  established  by the Board of
Trustees.  The Fund's  investments  are valued daily by an  independent  pricing
service, dealer quotations, or are valued at the last sale price on the exchange
that is the primary market for such securities, or the last quoted bid price for
those securities for which the over-the-counter market is the primary market for
listed  securities  in  which  there  were no  sales.  Prices  obtained  from an
independent  pricing  service  use  information  provided  by  market  makers or
estimates of market value  obtained from yield data relating to  investments  or
securities with similar  characteristics.  Short-term investments maturing in 60
days or less are valued at amortized  cost,  if their  original  maturity was 60
days or less, or by amortizing their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if
the original term to maturity  exceeded 60 days.  The prices used by the Fund to
value  securities  may  differ  from the value  that  would be  realized  if the
securities  were sold and the  differences  could be material  to the  financial
statements.  The  Fund's  net asset  value is  determined  daily at the close of
regular  trading  (normally,  4:00  p.m.  Eastern  time) on the New  York  Stock
Exchange.

(B) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment  transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on  investments  are determined on the  identified  cost basis.  Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on debt securities
purchased  are accreted or  amortized  to interest  income over the lives of the
respective  securities using the effective  interest method.  Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date.

(C) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies.  Accordingly, no
provision  for  U.S.  federal  income  taxes  is  required.   In  addition,   by
distributing  substantially  all of its ordinary  income and  long-term  capital
gains,  if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends not to be subject to
U.S. federal excise tax.

(D) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS--COMMON STOCK
The Fund  declares  dividends  from net  investment  income  monthly  to  common
shareholders.  Distributions  of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. The Fund records dividends and distributions to its shareholders
on the  ex-dividend  date.  The amount of dividends and  distributions  from net
investment  income and net realized  capital gains are  determined in accordance
with federal income tax  regulations,  which may differ from generally  accepted
accounting  principles.  These  "book-tax"  differences  are  considered  either
temporary or permanent in nature.  To the extent these differences are permanent
in nature,  such amounts are  reclassified  within the capital accounts based on
their  federal

<PAGE>


NICHOLAS-APPLEGATE  CONVERTIBLE  & INCOME FUND II NOTES TO FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS
December 31, 2004 (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


income tax treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.  To
the extent these dividends and/or  distributions  exceed current and accumulated
earnings  and profits  for  federal  income tax  purposes  they are  reported as
dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in excess of par.

(E) CREDIT-LINKED TRUST CERTIFICATES
Credit-linked  trust  certificates are investments in a limited purpose trust or
other  vehicle  formed  under state law which,  in turn,  invests in a basket of
derivative  instruments,  such as credit default swaps,  interest rate swaps and
other  securities,  in order to  provide  exposure  to the high yield or another
fixed income market.

Similar to an investment in a bond,  investments  in these  credit-linked  trust
certificates  represent the right to receive  periodic  income  payments (in the
form of  distributions)  and payment of  principal at the end of the term of the
certificate.  However,  these payments are conditioned on the trust's receipt of
payments from, and the trust's potential  obligations to, the  counterparties to
the derivative instruments and other securities in which the trust invests.

(F) INTEREST RATE CAPS
In an  interest  rate cap,  one party pays a fee while the other  party pays the
excess,  if any, of a floating rate over a specified  fixed rate.  Interest rate
caps are  intended  to manage the  Fund's  exposure  to  changes  in  short-term
interest rates and hedge the Auction Preferred Shares. Owning interest rate caps
reduces the Fund's  duration,  making it less  sensitive  to changes in interest
rates from a market value perspective.  The effect on income involves protection
from rising short-term rates,  which the Fund experiences  primarily in the form
of leverage.  The Fund is exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance
by the other party to the interest rate cap.

(G) CONCENTRATION OF RISK
It is the Fund's  policy to invest  the  majority  of its assets in  convertible
securities.  Although convertible  securities do derive part of their value from
that of the securities into which they are convertible,  they are not considered
derivative  financial  instruments.  However,  certain of the Fund's investments
include  features  which render them more  sensitive  to price  changes in their
underlying  securities.  Consequently,  the Fund is exposed to greater  downside
risk than traditional  convertible  securities,  but still less than that of the
underlying common stock.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
The Fund has entered into an Investment  Management  Agreement (the "Agreement")
with the Investment Manager to serve as the Fund's Investment  Manager.  Subject
to the  supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees,  the Investment  Manager is
responsible for managing,  either directly or through others selected by it, the
Fund's  investment  activities,  business  affairs and  administrative  matters.
Pursuant to the Agreement,  the Fund pays the Investment  Manager an annual fee,
payable  monthly,  at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Fund's average daily total
managed  assets.  Total  managed  assets  refer to the total  assets of the Fund
(including  assets  attributable  to any  Preferred  Shares  or  other  forms of
leverage  that  may  be  outstanding)  minus  accrued  liabilities  (other  than
liabilities  representing  leverage).  The  Investment  Manager has retained its
affiliate,  Nicholas-Applegate  Capital Management LLC (the  "Sub-Adviser"),  to
manage the Fund's  investments.  Subject to the  supervision  of the  Investment
Manager,  the Sub-Adviser  makes all the Fund's  investment  decisions.  For its
services pursuant to the sub-advisory agreement,  the Manager, and not the Fund,
will pay to NACM a monthly fee.

3. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES
For the six months ended December 31, 2004,  purchases and sales of investments,
other  than  short-term   securities,   were   $453,185,787  and   $507,731,258,
respectively.

The Fund is subject to certain  limitations  and  restrictions  while  preferred
shares  are   outstanding.   Failure  to  comply  with  these   limitations  and
restrictions   could   preclude  the  Fund  from   declaring  any  dividends  or
distributions to common  shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share,  generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on any
matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

On January 3, 2005,  a dividend of  $0.115625  per share was  declared to common

On February 1, 2004,  a dividend of  $0.115625  per share was declared to common
shareholders  payable  March 1, 2005 to  shareholders  of record on February 11,
2005.

7. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On September 13, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
announced that the  Investment  Manager and certain of its affiliates had agreed
to a settlement of charges that they and certain of their  officers  had,  among
other things,  violated various antifraud  provisions of the federal  securities
laws in connection with an alleged  market-timing  arrangement involving trading
of shares of various open-end investment companies ("open-end funds") advised or
distributed by the Investment  Manager and certain of its  affiliates.  In their
settlement  with the  Commission,  the Investment  Manager and their  affiliates
consented to the entry of an order by the Commission and,  without  admitting or
denying  the  findings  contained  in the  order,  agreed to  implement  certain
compliance and governance changes and consented to  cease-and-desist  orders and
censures.  In addition,  the Investment Manager and its affiliates agreed to pay
civil  money  penalties  in  the  aggregate   amount  $40  million  and  to  pay
disgorgement  in the  amount of $10  million,  for an  aggregate  payment of $50
million.  In connection  with the  settlement,  the  Investment  Manager and its
affiliates have been dismissed from the related  complaint the Commission  filed
on May 6, 2004 in the U.S.  District Court in the Southern District of New York.
Neither the  complaint  nor the order  alleges any  inappropriate  activity took
place with respect to the Fund.

In a related,  action on June 1, 2004, the Attorney  General of the State of New
Jersey  announced  that it had entered into a settlement  agreement with Allianz
Global and certain other  affiliates of the  Investment  Manager,  in connection
with a complaint filed by the New Jersey Attorney  General  ("NJAG") on February
17, 2004. In the settlement,  Allianz Global and other named affiliates  neither
admitted nor denied the  allegations or conclusions of law, but did agree to pay
New Jersey a civil fine of $15 million and $3 million  for  investigative  costs
and further potential  enforcement  initiatives against unrelated parties.  They
also undertook to implement certain governance  changes.  The complaint relating
to the  settlement  contained  allegations  arising out of the same matters that
were subject of the Commission order regarding market timing described above.

On September 15, 2004, the Commission  announced that the Investment Manager and
certain of its affiliates  agreed to settle an enforcement  action in connection
with  charges that they  violated  various  antifraud  and other  provisions  of
federal  securities  laws as a result of, among other  things,  their failure to
disclose  to the board of  trustees  and  shareholders  of

various open-end funds advised or distributed by the Investment  Manager and its
affiliates material facts and conflicts of interest that arose from their use of
brokerage  commissions  on portfolio  transactions  to pay for so-called  "shelf
space"  arrangements  with  certain  broker-dealers.   In  the  settlement,  the
Investment Manager and its affiliates  consented to the entry of an order by the
Commission  without admitting or denying the findings contained in the order. In
connection with the settlement, the Investment Manager and its affiliates agreed
to  undertake  certain  compliance  and  disclosure  reforms  and  consented  to
cease-and-desist  orders and censures.  In addition,  the Investment Manager and
these  affiliates  agreed to pay a civil money  penalty of $5 million and to pay
disgorgement  of $6.6  million  based upon the amount of  brokerage  commissions
alleged  to have been  paid by such  open-end  funds in  connection  with  these
arrangements  (and  related  interest).  In a  related  action,  the  California
Attorney  General  announced  on  September  15,  2004  that it had  entered  an
agreement  with an  affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager in  resolution  of an
investigation   into  matters  that  are  similar  to  those  discussed  in  the
Commission's  order. The settlement  agreement resolves matters described in the
compliant filed by the California  Attorney General in the Superior Court of the
State of California  alleging,  among other things, that this affiliate violated
certain  antifraud  provisions of California law by failing to disclose  matters
related to the  shelf-space  arrangements  described  above.  In the  settlement
agreement,  the  affiliate  did not admit to any  liability but agreed to pay $5
million  in civil  penalties  and $4 million in  recognition  of the  California
Attorney  General's fees and costs associated with the investigation and related
matters.  Neither the Commission's  order nor the California  Attorney General's
complaint  alleges any  inappropriate  activity  took place with  respect to the
Fund.

Since February 2004, the Investment  Manager and certain of its affiliates  have
been named as  defendants  in 14 lawsuits  filed in U.S.  District  Court in the
Southern  District of New York,  the  Central  District  of  California  and the
Districts of New Jersey and  Connecticut.  Ten of those lawsuits concern "market
timing,"  and they have  been  transferred  to and  consolidated  for  pre-trial
proceedings  in the U.S.  District  Court  for the  District  of  Maryland;  the
remaining four lawsuits concern  "revenue  sharing" with brokers offering "shelf
space"  and have been  consolidated  into a single  action in the U.S.  District
Court for the  District of  Connecticut.  The  lawsuits  have been  commenced as
putative  class actions on behalf of investors who  purchased,  held or redeemed
shares of affiliated funds during specified periods or as derivative  actions on
behalf of the funds.  The lawsuits  generally  relate to the same facts that are
the subject of the regulatory  proceedings  discussed  above. The lawsuits seek,
among other things,  unspecified compensatory damages plus interest and, in some
cases,  punitive damages,  the rescission of investment advisory contracts,  the
return of fees paid  under  those  contracts  and  restitution.  The  Investment
Manager and the Sub-Adviser  believe that other similar lawsuits may be filed in
U.S.  federal or state courts naming as defendants the Investment  Manager,  the
Sub-Adviser,  Allianz Global, the Fund, other open- and closed-end funds advised
or  distributed  by  the  Investment  Manager,   the  Sub-Adviser  and/or  their
affiliates,  the boards of trustees of those funds,  and/or other affiliates and
their employees.

Under Section 9(a) of the Investment  Company Act of 1940, if any of the various
regulatory  proceedings or lawsuits were to result in a court injunction against
the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, Allianz Global and/or their affiliates,
they and their  affiliates  would, in the absence of exemptive relief granted by
the Commission,  be barred from serving as an investment  adviser/sub-adviser or
principal  underwriter  for any  registered  investment  company,  including the
Funds. In connection  with an inquiry from the Commission  concerning the status
of the New Jersey settlement  described above under Section 9(a), the Investment
Manager,  the  Sub-Adviser,  and  certain  of their  affiliates  (together,  the
"Applicants")  have sought  exemptive  relief from the Commission  under Section
9(c) of the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940.  The  Commission  has granted the
Applicants  a  temporary  exemption  from the  provisions  of Section  9(a) with
respect to the New Jersey  settlement  until the earlier of (i)  September)  13,
2006 and (ii) the date on which  the  Commission  takes  final  action  on their
application  for a permanent  order.  There is no assurance  that the Commission
will issue a permanent order.

It is possible that these matters and/or other developments resulting from these
matters  could lead to a decrease  in the market  price of the Fund's  shares or
other  adverse  consequences  to the Fund  and its  shareholders.  However,  the
Investment Manager and the Sub-Adviser believe that these matters are not likely
to have a material adverse effect on the Fund or on the Investment  Manager's or
the Sub-Adviser's ability to perform its respective investment advisory services
relating to the Fund.

8. CORPORATE CHANGES
On September  14, 2004,  David C. Flattum was appointed to the Board of Trustees
and Youse Guia was named as the Fund's Chief Compliance  Officer.  On October 5,
2004, the Board of Trustees  elected  Robert E. Connor as Chairman.  On December
14, 2004, Thomas J. Fuccillo was appointed as the Fund's Secretary.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

In  January  2004,  the  Registrant's  Board of  Trustees  adopted a  Nominating
Committee  Charter  governing  the affairs of the  Nominating  Committee  of the
Board,   which   is   posted   on  the   PIMCO   Advisors   Funds   website   at
www.pimcoadvisors.com.  Appendix B to the Nominating  Committee Charter includes
"Procedures for Shareholders to Submit Nominee Candidates, "which sets forth the
procedures  by which  shareholders  may recommend  nominees to the  Registrant's
Board of Trustees.  Among other  requirements,  the procedures  provide that the
recommending  shareholder  must  submit  any  recommendation  in  writing to the
Registrant to the attention of the Registrant's Secretary, at the address of the
principal  executive  offices of the Registrant and that such submission must be
received  at such  offices  not less than 45 days nor more than 75 days prior to
the date of the  Board or  shareholder  meeting  at which the  nominee  would be
elected.   Any  recommendation  must  include  certain  biographical  and  other
information regarding the candidate and the recommending  shareholder,  and must
include a written and signed  consent of the  candidate to be named as a nominee
and  to  serve  as a  Trustee  if  elected.  The  foregoing  description  of the
requirements  is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to
Appendix B of the Nominating Committee Charter.

     Act of 1940,  as amended are effective  based on their  evaluation of these
     controls and  procedures  as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of
     this document.

(b)  There were no significant changes in the registrant's  internal controls or
     in factors that could affect these controls subsequent to the date of their
     evaluation,  including any  corrective  actions with regard to  significant
     deficiencies and material weaknesses.

                  registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an annual
                  report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely
