                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Forward-looking
statements include statements regarding the goals, beliefs, plans or current
expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust" or the "Advisor")
and/or Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners" or the
"Sub-Advisor") and their respective representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the
information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the
Advisor and/or Four Corners and their respective representatives only as of the
date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these
forward-looking statements to reflect events and circumstances that arise after
the date hereof.

                         PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of other risks of investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                             HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that can help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you

SHAREHOLDER LETTER

       FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  ANNUAL REPORT
                                  MAY 31, 2008

Dear Shareholders:

The year 2007 and the first half of 2008 have been challenging for the financial
markets and for many investors. Yet, regardless of the market, First Trust
Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") believes that in order to be successful in
reaching your financial goals, you should be invested for the long-term. We also
believe that investors should seek professional help from a financial advisor
who has been through many types of markets, knows the range of investments
available, and is committed to bringing you investments suitable to your
particular situation.

Our goal at First Trust has always been to offer a wide range of investment
products, including our family of closed-end funds, to help financial advisors
give you the opportunity to meet your financial objectives. We have continued to
expand our product line to ensure that you have many choices to fit your
investment needs.

The report you hold contains detailed information about your investment in First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II. It contains a portfolio
commentary from the Fund's portfolio management team that provides a market
recap for the period, a performance analysis and a market and Fund outlook.
Additionally, the report provides the Fund's financial statements for the period
covered by this report. I encourage you to read this document and discuss it
with your financial advisor.

As you may be aware, there is continuing uncertainty caused by the unprecedented
auction failures of auction rate preferred securities, also known as ARPS, over
the past several months. This Fund has issued this type of security, and First
Trust believes that auction rate securities may continue to experience failed
auctions. I want you to know that First Trust is seeking methods for refinancing
the outstanding auction rate securities that are experiencing failed auctions.
The ability to obtain this refinancing is contingent on finding third parties
willing to provide such financing on a cost effective basis. We will report to
you in the next edition of this report regarding this issue, or you may check
with your financial advisor.

First Trust has been through many types of markets and remains committed to
bringing you quality investment solutions regardless of the inevitable ups and
downs experienced in the market. We offer a variety of products that may fit
many financial plans to help those investors seeking long-term investment
success. As well, we are committed to giving you up-to-date information about
your investments so you and your financial advisor are always current on your
portfolio.

We continue to value our relationship with you, and we thank you for the
opportunity to assist you in achieving your financial goals.

Sincerely,


/s/ James A. Bowen
James A. Bowen
President of First Trust/Four Corners
Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II

FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of the First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating
Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues its objectives by investing in a portfolio of Senior Loans. There
can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The
Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP

The Fund's fiscal year ended May 31, 2008 included some of the most volatile
conditions in Senior Loan market history, despite strong fundamental performance
and record low default rates during much of the year. The year included the
worst quarter ever recorded (Q1 2008), during which the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan
Index ("Index") declined by -5.7%, and also included the best ever monthly Index
gain of 3.7% in April. As described in more detail below, we expect ongoing
volatility in the Senior Loan market to be higher than it had been prior to
Fiscal 2008.

As the sub-prime crisis began to unfold in mid-2007, there was a spillover
impact on the supply/demand relationship in the Senior Loan market. In recent
years, structured, securitized investment products such as collateralized loan
obligations ("CLOs") have been a significant source of demand in the Senior Loan
market, driving Senior Loan spreads to historical lows. As the sub-prime crisis
began to unfold, there was a dramatic global reduction in demand for all
structured product assets, including CLOs. This, in turn, resulted in a swift
and severe decline in demand for Senior Loans, even though most Senior Loans
have no direct exposure to sub-prime mortgage assets.


                                     Page 3

<PAGE>

                       PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (CONTINUED)

This dramatic reduction in demand coincided with record levels of Senior Loan
supply, as private equity firms sought to take advantage of favorable credit
markets, and commercial and investment banks agreed to provide Senior Loan and
high-yield bond financing for record amounts of mergers and acquisitions on very
borrower-friendly terms. This increase in supply, coupled with the decrease in
demand, created an imbalance that caused unprecedented declines in Senior Loan
prices, despite the fact that most CLOs and Senior Loans continue to perform
well.

The void created by the lack of CLO demand for Senior Loans has been partially
filled by non-traditional Senior Loan investors such as hedge funds, distressed
investors, newly created "dislocation" funds and equity-income funds. At reduced
price levels, these non-traditional investors recognized attractive relative
value in Senior Loans, which are typically secured and have priority claims over
borrowers' assets. However, these new Senior Loan market investors are typically
more focused on value across multiple asset classes, as opposed to being
dedicated to investing in Senior Loans, and as credit spreads widen or asset
prices decline across various asset classes, these investors are more likely to
trade in and out of Senior Loans (depending upon their relative value). This
increased capital velocity is in sharp contrast to the historically stable CLO
investor base. While we believe that these "non-traditional" investors will
continue to have incremental demand for loans and improve technical conditions
overall, we also believe that, compared to historical periods, their
participation in the Senior Loan market will result in higher volatility for the
foreseeable future.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

FCT's NAV return of -5.2%(1) was one of the highest among its "pure-play" peer
group in Fiscal 2008, and the Fund's NAV return exceeded the broad peer group
average of -7.6%.(2) This is a result of the Fund's focus on higher quality
credit than many of its peers. The NAV return underperformed the Index return of
- -2.4% as a result of the negative impact of leverage, fees, expenses, and
un-invested cash balances which were not part of the Index return. The Fund
generated a total return of -14.3%(3) including market price change and
dividends for Fiscal 2008. The Fund's closing price on May 31, 2008 was $14.76,
which represented a 10.1% discount to its NAV, compared to the Fund's discount
to NAV of 0.5% twelve months earlier.

While credit spreads have widened significantly during Fiscal 2008, the
underlying FCT portfolio is still made up primarily of Senior Loans purchased
during the last several years. The credit spreads on these Senior Loans are
generally below the spreads on new Senior Loans which are being issued in the
current environment. As the assets in the Fund prepay, we will re-invest the
proceeds in either newly-issued Senior Loans that we expect to be on better
economic and structural terms than those which were issued prior to the loan
market correction, or pre-correction Senior Loans at discounted dollar prices.

The combination of reduced short-term interest rates and the credit spread
compression of recent years has pressured the Fund's dividend. While the Fund
has kept the dividend stable since October 2007, and had previously increased
its dividend 13 times, it has announced a dividend reduction for the June 2008
monthly dividend. The dividend distribution totaled $1.37 per Common Share
during the fiscal year, which represented an 8.7% decrease from the prior fiscal
year. Based on the Fund's current dividend, FCT's distribution rate is 8.8%
(calculated on the Fund's share price) and 7.9% (based on the Fund's NAV) as of
May 31, 2008, which was the highest yield among pure-play competitors and better
than the pure play peer group averages of 7.1% and 6.5%, respectively.

While we are disappointed with the Senior Loan market's heightened volatility
and the Fund's poor market price performance, we do believe that the recent
correction is healthy and good for the market overall. We were also pleased with
the Fund's relative performance compared to the peer group, based on total
return as well as current yield and the Fund's credit positioning going into an
economic slow down. Credit standards had been eroding in 2006 and 2007 and the
correction has already resulted in new loans being issued on more
investor-friendly economic and structural terms. As discussed above, the Senior
Loan market witnessed a marked increase in volatility during the period covered
by this report. The Fund's NAV fluctuated from a high of $18.85 to a low of
$14.84, a difference of $4.01 per Common Share, whereas the market price of the
Fund closed as high as $19.08 and as low as $13.04, a difference of $6.04 per
Common Share.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK

Default rates during most of Fiscal 2008 were at or near historically low
levels, going as low as 0.2% in June 2007.(4) However, we have seen a meaningful
increase in default rates during calendar 2008, and Fiscal 2008 ended with a
trailing 12-month default rate of 1.7%.(5) We believe that the U.S. economy is
slowing and that default rates will continue to increase for the foreseeable
future.

Despite increasing default rates, we believe that the Senior Loan prices are
still being depressed by weak technical conditions and that Senior Loans are
"cheap" based on their underlying fundamentals. Loan market spreads based on an
assumed 3-year life were 626 basis points above LIBOR as of May 31, 2008.(6)
Assuming historical average default and recovery rates, we believe current loan
prices and spread levels imply continuous default rates of 12.9%, versus the
1.7% trailing default rate and the highest default rate ever of 7.5% in June
2000.(5)(7) This means that over one in three loans would need to default in the
next three years to justify current credit spreads; however, Four Corners does
not believe that this

default level is likely. While we do expect Senior Loans to remain volatile, we
also see good value in the asset class at current price and spread levels.
Furthermore, we believe that we have constructed a portfolio that will continue
to perform in a slowing economy and offer investors a compelling yield.

     obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan and changes in NAV per Common

2)   The "pure-play" peer group consists of a smaller subset (FCM, FCT, PPR, TLI
     and VVR) of the broad peer group, which invests almost exclusively in
     senior loans. We believe that these "pure-play" funds are generally more
     comparable to the Fund than the broad peer group as the non-senior loan
     holdings are routinely less than 5% of the fund. Of the broad peer group,
     eleven funds invest a material portion of their assets in high yield bonds,
     emerging markets debt or other types of corporate debt securities.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2008

                              1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined
daily, as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m.
Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses, dividends declared
but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund) and the liquidation value of any
outstanding Preferred Shares, by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value according
to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of the Fund's
assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties. In the
event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing service does
not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations are deemed
unreliable, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value
method to value the Fund's securities and other investments. Additionally, if
events occur after the close of the principal market for particular securities
(e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities), but before the Fund values its
assets, that could materially affect NAV, First Trust may use a fair value
method to value the Fund's securities and other investments. The use of fair
value pricing by the Fund is governed by valuation procedures adopted by the
Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior
Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior
Loan at a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2008

day as of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities
traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding securities traded on the
NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature
in less than 60 days when purchased are valued at amortized cost.

B. CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS:

The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes or to
gain exposure to a credit in which the Fund may otherwise invest. A credit
default swap contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit
risk of an issuer. The Fund may be either the buyer or seller in a credit
default swap transaction. The "buyer" in a credit default swap contract is
obligated to pay the "seller" a periodic stream of payments over the term of the
contract provided that no event of default on the underlying reference
obligation has occurred. If an event of default occurs, the seller must pay the
buyer the full notional value, or "par value", of the reference obligation. In
exchange, the seller receives the par value of securities of the reference
obligor. In the case of cash settlement, the seller will pay the difference
between par and the market value of the securities of the reference obligor. An
event of default may be a grace period extension, obligation acceleration,
repudiation/moratorium, or restructuring.

Buying a credit default swap contract involves the risk that the contract may
expire worthless and the credit risk that the seller may fail to satisfy its
payment obligations to the Fund in the event of default. Selling a credit
default swap contract involves greater risks than if the Fund had invested in
the reference obligation directly. The Fund will segregate cash or liquid assets
in an amount equal to the aggregate market value of the credit default swap
contracts of which it is a seller. Additionally, the Fund maintains cash or
liquid assets for the full notional amount of the credit default swap contracts
of which it is a seller. The Fund may only enter into such transactions with
counterparties rated A- or higher.

Credit default swap contracts are marked to market daily based upon quotations
from brokers or market makers and the change in value, if any, is recorded as
unrealized appreciation (depreciation). For a credit default swap contract sold
by the Fund, payment of the agreed upon amount made by the Fund in the event of
default of the referenced debt obligation is recorded as the cost of the
reference debt obligation purchased/received.

C. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

D. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such securities
is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund maintains liquid assets with a
current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued or
delayed-delivery purchase commitments. At May 31, 2008, the Fund had no
when-issued or delayed-delivery purchase commitments.

                                  MAY 31, 2008

E. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
approximately $2,452,803 as of May 31, 2008. The Fund is obligated to fund these
loan commitments at the borrower's discretion. Net unrealized depreciation of
$146,835 from these commitments is included in "Net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation) on investments and swap transactions" on the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities.

F. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that cannot be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. Prior to registration, restricted securities may only be
resold in transactions exempt from registration. The Fund held restricted
securities at May 31, 2008 as shown in the following table. The Fund does not
have the right to demand that such securities be registered. These securities
are valued using market quotations according to the valuation procedures as
stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a
discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted security. There are
no unrestricted securities with the same maturity dates and yields for these
issuers.

</TABLE>

(l)  Security was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on July
     31, 2007.

G. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterizations of distributions
made by the Fund. Permanent differences incurred during the year ended May 31,
2008, resulting in book and tax accounting differences, have been reclassified
at year end to reflect a decrease in undistributed net investment income by
$165,944 and an increase in accumulated net realized gain (loss) on investments
sold by $165,944. Net assets applicable to Common Shareholders were not affected
by this reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2008 and May 31, 2007 was as follows:

</TABLE>

H. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes.

The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws, which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of loss and offset such loss against any future realized capital gains. At
May 31, 2008, the Fund had available realized capital losses of $3,984,460 and
$3,611,723 to offset future net capital gains through the fiscal years ending
2014 and 2016, respectively.

POST-OCTOBER LOSSES. Under current laws, certain losses realized after October
31 may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following
fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2008, the Fund intends to elect
to defer net realized losses incurred from November 1, 2007 through May 31, 2008
of $3,884,858.

In June 2006, Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No.
48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB
Statement 109 ("FIN 48"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2006. This Interpretation prescribes a minimum threshold for
financial statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. As of May 31, 2008, management has
evaluated the application of FIN 48 to the Fund, and has determined that there
is no material impact resulting from the adoption of this Interpretation on the
Fund's financial statements.

I. EXPENSES:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

J. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT:

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 Fair Value Measurements
("FAS 157"), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Disclosure will include fair
value measurement at the reporting date and the assignment of levels within the
hierarchy in which the fair value measurements fall. At this time, management is
evaluating the implications of FAS 157 and its impact on the Fund's financial
statements, if any, has not been determined.

In March 2008, FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
161, "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS
161"). FAS 161 requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies
for using derivatives, quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and
gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about
credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative agreements. The
application of FAS 161 is required for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2008 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of FAS 161 will have on the Fund's financial
statement disclosures, if any.

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

                       6. AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of May 31, 2008, the Fund has
2,000 Series A and 2,000 Series B AMP Shares outstanding at a liquidation value
of $25,000 per share.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date. The Fund pays commissions to the auction agent as
compensation for conducting the auctions. These fees are included in the
"Auction Market Preferred Shares commission fees" on the Statement of
Operations.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (CONTINUED)

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2008

The markets for auction rate securities have continued to experience a number of
failed auctions, including auctions relating to the Series A AMP Shares and
Series B AMP Shares. A failed auction results when there are not enough bidders
in the auction at rates below the maximum rate as prescribed by the terms of the
security. When an auction fails, the rate is automatically set at the maximum
rate. A failed auction does not cause an acceleration of, or otherwise have any
impact on, outstanding principal amounts due. In the case of the Fund's
outstanding Series A AMP Shares and Series B AMP Shares, the maximum rate under
the terms of those securities has been one hundred twenty-five percent (and
could be up to three hundred percent, depending on the ratings of the Series A
AMP Shares and Series B AMP Shares) of the greater of: (1) the applicable AA
composite commercial paper rate (for a rate period of fewer than 184 days) or
the applicable U.S. Treasury index rate (for a rate period of 184 days or more),
or (2) the applicable London-InterBank Offered Rate.

On July 2, 2008, the Fund redeemed $20 million of its $100 million outstanding
AMP Shares, consisting of $10 million Series A AMP Shares and $10 million Series
B AMP Shares with proceeds from a Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility" -
see Note 7 below) with Citigroup North America Inc., as Agent. The Credit
Facility is to be used as leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an
expiration date of May 15, 2009. The total commitment under the Credit Facility
is $195,000,000. Loans under the Credit Facility will bear interest at a per
annum rate equal to either: (i) a commercial paper note rate, (ii) Eurodollar
Rate plus a margin, or (iii) the prime rate publicly announced by Citibank N.A.
plus a margin. The annual interest rate in effect at July 2, 2008 was 2.79%. The
Fund also pays additional borrowing costs, which include a program fee of 0.75%
and a liquidity fee of 0.50% per year. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act,
the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage"
of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings).

First Trust is continuing to seek methods for refinancing the approximately $80
million of the Fund's AMP Shares that remain outstanding. The ability to obtain
this refinancing is contingent on finding third parties willing to provide such
financing on a cost effective basis. There is no assurance that First Trust will
be successful in finding such financing, and any such financing arrangements
would be subject to approval of the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of May 31, 2008 was 3.54% and 3.95% for
the Series A 7 day and Series B 28 day auctions, respectively. The dividend
rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates. The high and low annual dividend rates during the
year ended May 31, 2008, for the Series A 7 day auction were 6.25% and 3.54%,
respectively, and the average dividend rate was 4.95%. The high and low annual
dividend rates during the year ended May 31, 2008, for the Series B 28 day
auction were 6.50% and 3.95%, respectively, and the average dividend rate was
5.11%. These rates may vary in a manner not related directly to the income
received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a beneficial or
detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to Common
Shareholders.

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.

                          7. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund has entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit
Facility") with various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be
used as leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of May
15, 2009. The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the
Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the
requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings,
must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total
assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is
$195,000,000. For the year ended May 31, 2008, the average amount outstanding
was $174,904,372. The high and low annual interest rates during the year ended
May 31, 2008, were 5.75% and 2.70%, respectively, with a weighted average
interest rate of 4.67%. The annual interest rate in effect at May 31, 2008 was
2.71%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs, which include a program
fee of 0.75% and a liquidity fee of 0.50% per year. Such expenses are included
in "Interest and fees on loan" on the Statement of Operations.

                             8. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.

                                  MAY 31, 2008

any point in time may be worth less than the original investment, even after
taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends and distributions.
Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including the general
condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events affecting the
issuers occur.

LOWER GRADE DEBT INSTRUMENTS: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally lower grade. These lower grade debt instruments may become the subject
of bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise subsequently default as to the repayment
of principal and/or payment of interest or be downgraded to ratings in the lower
rating categories. Lower grade debt instruments tend to be less liquid than
higher grade debt instruments.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. The Fund borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing
program, through the issuance of Preferred Shares, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares and the holders of Preferred Shares, with
respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in
compliance with certain credit facility provisions, the Fund may not be
permitted to declare dividends or other distributions, including dividends and
distributions with respect to Common Shares or Preferred Shares or purchase
Common Shares or Preferred Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. The value of the collateral may not
equal the Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline
below the principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's
investment. Also, to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the
borrower or its subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the
stock may decline in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or
substantially all of its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under
collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior
Loan may not satisfy the issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of
non-payment of scheduled interest or principal, and the collateral may not be
readily liquidated.

AUCTION RISK: If an auction fails you may not be able to sell some or all of
your preferred shares. No third parties related to the auction nor the Fund
itself are obligated to purchase preferred shares in an auction or otherwise,
nor is the Fund required to redeem preferred shares in the event of a failed
auction.

                               9. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On May 19, 2008, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.095 per share to Common
Shareholders of record June 4, 2008, payable June 16, 2008.

On June 20, 2008, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.080 per share to Common
Shareholders of record July 3, 2008, payable July 15, 2008.

Effective July 14, 2008, PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc., formerly
known as PFPC, and PFPC Trust Company, no longer serve as the Fund's
Administrator and Transfer Agent and Custodian. As of that date, in accordance
with certain fee agreements, JPMorgan Investor Services Company serves as the
Fund's Administrator and Fund Accountant, JP Morgan Chase Bank, National
Association serves as the Custodian and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
serves as the Transfer Agent.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR
FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of May 31, 2008, the related statement of
operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for the periods presented. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2008, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, agent banks, and brokers; where replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Fund as of May 31, 2008, the results of its operations and its cash flows for
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in
the period then ended, and the financial highlights for the periods presented,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2008

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

     (1)  If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
          the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price equal
          to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or (ii) 95% of
          the market price on that date.

     (2)  If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
          Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will
          purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or elsewhere,
          for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price
          for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed
          its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by
          the Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time of valuation,
          resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or
          distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The
          Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions received in cash
          to purchase Common Shares in the open market within 30 days of the
          valuation date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
          purchases is necessary to comply with federal securities laws.
          Interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 659-2649, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions and a transaction fee of $15.00.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing American Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219 or through their
website located at www.amstock.com (you will need to know your 10-digit
participant number and social security number to gain access to your account
online.)

                      ADVISORY AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING CONTINUATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND
SUB-ADVISORY CONTRACTS

The Board of Trustees of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II (the "Fund"), including the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved
the continuation of the Investment Management Agreement (the "Advisory
Agreement") between the Fund and First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor") and
the Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (the "Sub-Advisory Agreement" and together
with the Advisory Agreement, the "Agreements") among the Fund, the Advisor and
Four Corners Capital Management, LLC (the "Sub-Advisor"), at a meeting held on
March 3, 2008. The Board determined that the terms of the Agreements are fair
and reasonable and that the Agreements continue to be in the best interests of
the Fund.

To reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as well as under
the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving advisory
contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the fiduciary duty
of investment advisors with respect to advisory agreements and compensation; the
standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have
fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by the Board in voting
on such agreements. To assist the Board in its evaluation of the Agreements, the
Independent Trustees received a separate report from each of the Advisor and the
Sub-Advisor in advance of the Board meeting responding to a request for
information from counsel to the Independent Trustees. The reports, among other
things, outlined the services provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor
(including the relevant personnel responsible for these services and their
experience); the advisory and sub-advisory fees for the Fund as compared to fees
charged by investment advisors and sub-advisors to comparable funds and as
compared to fees charged to other clients of the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor;
expenses of the Fund as compared to expense ratios of comparable funds; the
nature of expenses incurred in providing services to the Fund and the potential
for economies of scale, if any; financial data on the Advisor and the
Sub-Advisor; any fall-out benefits to the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor; and
information on the Advisor's and the Sub-Advisor's compliance programs. The
Independent Trustees also met separately with their independent legal counsel to
discuss the information provided by the Advisor and the

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) - (CONTINUED)

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2008

Sub-Advisor. The Board applied its business judgment to determine whether the
arrangements between the Fund and the Advisor and among the Fund, the Advisor
and the Sub-Advisor are reasonable business arrangements from the Fund's
perspective as well as from the perspective of shareholders.

In reviewing the Agreements, the Board considered the nature, quality and extent
of services provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor under the Agreements.
With respect to the Advisory Agreement, the Board considered that the Advisor is
responsible for the overall management and administration of the Fund, including
the oversight of the Sub-Advisor. The Board noted the compliance program that
had been developed by the Advisor and considered that the compliance program
includes policies and procedures for monitoring the Sub-Advisor's compliance
with the 1940 Act and the Fund's investment objectives and policies. With
respect to the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board received a presentation from
representatives of the Sub-Advisor discussing the services that the Sub-Advisor
provides to the Fund and how the Sub-Advisor meets the Fund's investment
objectives. In light of the information presented and the considerations made,
the Board concluded that the nature, quality and extent of services provided to
the Fund by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor under the Agreements have been and
are expected to remain satisfactory and that the Sub-Advisor has managed the
Fund consistent with its investment objectives and policies.

The Board considered the advisory and sub-advisory fees paid under the
Agreements. The Board reviewed data prepared by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper"), an
independent source, showing the management fees and expense ratios of the Fund
as compared to the management fees and expense ratios of one peer group selected
by Lipper and a second peer group selected by the Advisor. The Board discussed
with representatives of the Advisor the differences between the two peer groups
and the limitations in creating a relevant peer group for the Fund including the
difficulties in comparing (i) funds using different types of leverage, (ii)
"pure play" funds such as the Fund with senior loan funds that invest in high
yield bonds and (iii) senior loan funds with significantly different asset
levels than the Fund's. Based on the information provided, the Board noted that
the Fund's management fees were in the third quintile of both the Lipper peer
group and the Advisor peer group and that the Fund's expense ratio was in the
third and fourth quintiles of the Lipper peer group and the Advisor peer group,
respectively. The Board also considered the sub-advisory fee rate and how it
related to the overall management fee structure of the Fund and noted that the
Advisor pays the Sub-Advisor out of the advisory fees it receives from the Fund.
Finally, the Board considered the advisory fees paid to the Advisor by similar
funds, and noted that the Advisor does not provide advisory services to clients
with investment objectives and policies similar to the Fund's other than to two
other closed end funds. The Board also considered information provided by the
Sub-Advisor as to the fees it charges to other clients.

The Board also considered the Fund's performance for the one-, two- and three
year periods, as applicable, ended September 30, 2007, as compared to the
performance of a relevant benchmark index and to a performance group selected by
Lipper. The Board noted that the Fund's performance was in the third quintile of
the performance group for the one- and three-year periods and in the fourth
quintile of the performance group for the two-year period. The board also noted
that the Fund underperformed its benchmark for the one-year period. The Board
also considered performance data provided by the Advisor for the one-year and
since-inception periods ended December 31, 2007, and considered an analysis
prepared by the Advisor on benefits provided by the Fund's leverage. In
addition, the Board considered the market price and net asset value performance
of the Fund since inception, and compared the Fund's premium/discount to the
average and median premium/discount of the Lipper peer group, noting that the
Fund's premium/discount was generally indicative of the asset class and market
events. The Board concluded that the Fund's performance was reasonable,
particularly in light of the small number of funds managed in a similar "pure
play" style, without a high yield bond component.

On the basis of all the information provided on the fees, expenses and
performance of the Fund, the Board concluded that the advisory and sub-advisory
fees were reasonable and appropriate in light of the nature, quality and extent
of services provided by the Advisor and Sub-Advisor under the Agreements.

The Board noted that the Advisor has continued to invest in personnel and
infrastructure and had noted that the advisory fee is not structured to pass the
benefits of any economies of scale on to the shareholders as the Fund's assets
grow. The Board concluded that the management fee reflects an appropriate level
of sharing of any economies of scale. The Board also considered the costs of the
services provided and profits realized by the Advisor from serving as investment
manager to closed-end funds for the twelve months ended December 31, 2007, as
set forth in the materials provided to the Board. The Board noted the inherent
limitations in the profitability analysis, and concluded that the Advisor's
profitability appeared to be not excessive in light of the services provided to
the Fund. In addition, the Board considered and discussed any ancillary benefits
derived by the Advisor from its relationship with the Fund and noted that the
typical fall out benefits to the Advisor such as soft dollars are not present.
The Board concluded that any other fall-out benefits received by the Advisor or
its affiliates would appear to be attenuated.

                                  MAY 31, 2008

The Board considered that the Sub-Advisor's investment services expenses are
primarily fixed, and that the Sub-Advisor had added personnel in the past year
to improve the quality and consistency of services and anticipated continued
investments in personnel and systems. The Board considered that the sub-advisory
fee rate was negotiated at arm's length between the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor,
an unaffiliated third party. The Board also considered data provided by the
Sub-Advisor as to the profitability of the Sub-Advisory Agreement to the
Sub-Advisor, noting that the method used to allocate expenses was not a typical
practice of the Sub-Advisor. The Board noted the inherent limitations in this
profitability analysis and concluded that the profitability analysis for the
Advisor was more relevant, although the profitability of the Sub-Advisory
Agreement appeared to be not excessive in light of the services provided to the
Fund. The Board noted that the Sub-Advisor does not maintain any soft-dollar
arrangements and that the Sub-Advisor indicated that it does not receive any
material fall-out benefits from its relationship to the Fund.

Based on all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, determined that the terms of the
Agreements continue to be fair and reasonable and that the continuation of the
Agreements is in the best interests of the Fund. No single factor was
determinative in the Board's analysis.

          more of the items set forth in paragraph (b) of this item's
          instructions.

ITEM 4.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

     (a) AUDIT FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed for each of the
last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the principal
accountant for the audit of the registrant's annual financial statements or

<PAGE>

     (b) AUDIT-RELATED FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed in each of

each of the last two fiscal years of the registrant for assurance and related

(e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

     Pursuant to its charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy, the Audit Committee (the "COMMITTEE") is responsible for the
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including
the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Registrant by its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the Committee authorized to give such
pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up to $25,000 and report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

     The Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the independent
auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's adviser (not
including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant, subject to
the DE MINIMIS exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has provided non-audit services to
the Registrant's adviser (other than any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is sub-contracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were

<PAGE>

not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Committee will consider whether
the provision of such non-audit services is compatible with the auditor's
independence.

(e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
(d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser of this Item that
were approved by the audit committee pursuant to the pre-approval exceptions
included in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X are as follows:

               (b)  0%

               (c)  0%

               (d)  0%

     (f)  The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
          engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most
          recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons
          other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees
          was less than fifty percent.

     (g)  The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant for
          services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
          investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
          primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen
          by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled
          by, or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing
          services to the Registrant for 2007 were $11,186 and $65,072 for the
          Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser and for 2008 were
          $5,000 and $19,502 for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment
          adviser, respectively.

     (h)  The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined
          that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
          Registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
          role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
          overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
          controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
          that provides ongoing services to the Registrant that were not
          pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
          Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
          accountant's independence.

ITEM 5.  AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

     (a)  The registrant has a separately designated audit committee consisting
          of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The members of the
          audit committee are: Thomas R. Kadlec, Niel B. Nielson, Richard E.
          Erickson and Robert F. Keith.

     close of the reporting period is included as part of the report to
     shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                           FIRST TRUST ADVISORS, L.P.
                                FIRST TRUST FUNDS
                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

     First Trust Advisors, L.P. (the "ADVISER") serves as investment adviser
providing discretionary investment advisory services for several open or
closed-end investment companies (the "FUNDS"). As part of these services, the
Adviser has full responsibility for proxy voting and related duties. In
fulfilling these duties, the Adviser and Funds have adopted the following
policies and procedures:

     1.   It is the Adviser's policy to seek to ensure that proxies for
          securities held by a Fund are voted consistently and solely in the
          best economic interests of the respective Fund.

     2.   The Adviser shall be responsible for the oversight of a Fund's proxy
          voting process and shall assign a senior member of its staff to be
          responsible for this oversight.

     3.   The Adviser has engaged the services of Institutional Shareholder
          Services, Inc. ("ISS") to make recommendations to the Adviser on the
          voting of proxies related to securities held by a Fund. ISS provides
          voting recommendations based on established guidelines and practices.
          The Adviser has adopted these ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines.

     4.   The Adviser shall review the ISS recommendations and generally will
          vote the proxies in accordance with such recommendations.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Adviser may not vote in accordance
          with the ISS recommendations if the Adviser believes that the specific
          ISS recommendation is not in the best interests of the respective
          Fund.

     5.   If the Adviser manages the assets or pension fund of a company and any
          of the Adviser's clients hold any securities in that company, the
          Adviser will vote proxies relating to such company's securities in
          accordance with the ISS recommendations to avoid any conflict of
          interest. In addition, if the Adviser has actual knowledge of any
          other type of material conflict of interest between itself and the
          respective Fund with respect to the voting of a proxy, the Adviser
          shall vote the applicable proxy in accordance with the ISS
          recommendations to avoid such conflict of interest.

     6.   If a Fund requests the Adviser to follow specific voting guidelines or
          additional guidelines, the Adviser shall review the request and follow
          such guidelines, unless the Adviser

<PAGE>

          determines that it is unable to follow such guidelines. In such case,
          the Adviser shall inform the Fund that it is not able to follow the
          Fund's request.

     7.   The Adviser may have clients in addition to the Funds which have
          provided the Adviser with discretionary authority to vote proxies on
          their behalf. In such cases, the Adviser shall follow the same
          policies and procedures.

1. Operational Items

ADJOURN MEETING

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to provide management with the authority to
adjourn an annual or special meeting absent compelling reasons to support the
proposal.

Vote FOR proposals that relate specifically to soliciting votes for a merger or
transaction if supporting that merger or transaction. Vote AGAINST proposals if
the wording is too vague or if the proposal includes "other business."

AMEND QUORUM REQUIREMENTS

Vote AGAINST proposals to reduce quorum requirements for shareholder meetings
below a majority of the shares outstanding unless there are compelling reasons
to support the proposal.

AMEND MINOR BYLAWS

Vote FOR bylaw or charter changes that are of a housekeeping nature (updates or
corrections).

AUDITOR INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

Consider the issue of auditor indemnification and limitation of liability on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis. Factors to be assessed include, but are not limited to:

     -    The terms of the auditor agreement- the degree to which these
          agreements impact shareholders' rights;

     -    Motivation and rationale for establishing the agreements;

     -    Quality of disclosure; and

     -    Historical practices in the audit area.

WTHHOLD or vote AGAINST members of an audit committee in situations where there
is persuasive evidence that the audit committee entered into an inappropriate
indemnification agreement with its auditor that limits the ability of the
company, or its shareholders, to pursue legitimate legal recourse against the
audit firm.

AUDITOR RATIFICATION

Vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the following apply:

     -    An auditor has a financial interest in or association with the
          company, and is therefore not independent;

     -    There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered
          an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
          financial position;

     -    Poor accounting practices are identified that rise to a serious level
          of concern, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; and material
          weaknesses identified in Section 404 disclosures; or

     -    Fees for non-audit services ("Other" fees) are excessive.

Non-audit fees are excessive if:

Non-audit ("other") fees > audit fees + audit-related fees + tax
compliance/preparation fees


                  2008 US PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES SUMMARY -6-

<PAGE>

RISKMETRICS Group                                            www.riskmetrics.com

Tax compliance and preparation include the preparation of original and amended
tax returns, refund claims and tax payment planning. All other services in the
tax category, such as tax advice, planning or consulting should be added to
"Other" fees. If the breakout of tax fees cannot be determined, add all tax fees
to "Other" fees.

In circumstances where "Other" fees include fees related to significant one-time
capital structure events: initial public offerings, bankruptcy emergence, and
spin-offs; and the company makes public disclosure of the amount and nature of
those fees which are an exception to the standard "non-audit fee" category, then
such fees may be excluded from the non-audit fees considered in determining the
ratio of non-audit to audit/audit-related fees/tax compliance and preparation
for purposes of determining whether non-audit fees are excessive.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to prohibit or limit
their auditors from engaging in non-audit services.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking for audit firm rotation,
taking into account:

     -    The tenure of the audit firm;

     -    The length of rotation specified in the proposal;

     -    Any significant audit-related issues at the company;

     -    The number of Audit Committee meetings held each year;

     -    The number of financial experts serving on the committee; and

     -    Whether the company has a periodic renewal process where the auditor
          is evaluated for both audit quality and competitive price.

CHANGE COMPANY NAME

Vote FOR proposals to change the corporate name.

CHANGE DATE, TIME, OR LOCATION OF ANNUAL MEETING

Vote FOR management proposals to change the date, time, and/or location of the
annual meeting unless the proposed change is unreasonable.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to change the date, time, and/or location of
the annual meeting unless the current scheduling or location is unreasonable.

TRANSACT OTHER BUSINESS

Vote AGAINST proposals to approve other business when it appears as voting item.

2. Board of Directors:

VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS

Vote on director nominees should be determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD(1) from individual directors who:

     -    Attend less than 75 percent of the board and committee meetings
          without a valid excuse (such as illness, service to the nation, work
          on behalf of the company);

     -    Sit on more than six public company boards;

     -    Are CEOs of public companies who sit on the boards of more than two
          public companies besides their own-- withhold only at their outside
          boards.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from all nominees of the board of directors, (except
from new nominees, who should be considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis) if:

     -    The company's proxy indicates that not all directors attended 75% of
          the aggregate of their board and committee meetings, but fails to
          provide the required disclosure of the names of the directors
          involved. If this information cannot be obtained, vote
          against/withhold from all incumbent directors;

     -    The company's poison pill has a dead-hand or modified dead-hand
          feature. Vote against/withhold every year until this feature is
          removed;

     -    The board adopts or renews a poison pill without shareholder approval,
          does not commit to putting it to shareholder vote within 12 months of
          adoption (or in the case of an newly public company, does not commit
          to put the pill to a shareholder vote within 12 months following the
          IPO), or reneges on a commitment to put the pill to a vote, and has
          not yet received a withhold/against recommendation for this issue;

     -    The board failed to act on a shareholder proposal that received
          approval by a majority of the shares outstanding the previous year (a
          management proposal with other than a FOR recommendation by management
          will not be considered as sufficient action taken);

     -    The board failed to act on a shareholder proposal that received
          approval of the majority of shares cast for the previous two
          consecutive years (a management proposal with other than a FOR
          recommendation by management will not be considered as sufficient
          action taken);

     -    The board failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of the
          shareholders tendered their shares;

     -    At the previous board election, any director received more than 50
          percent withhold/against votes of the shares cast and the company has
          failed to address the underlying issue(s) that caused the high
          withhold/against vote;

     -    The company is a Russell 3000 company that underperformed its industry
          group (GICS group) under the criteria discussed in the section
          "Performance Test for Directors";

     -    The board is classified, and a continuing director responsible for a
          problematic governance issue at the board/committee level that would
          warrant a withhold/against vote recommendation is not up for election-
          any or all appropriate nominees (except new) may be held accountable.

- ----------
(1)  In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use "Withhold" as the
     valid contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a majority
     vote standard use "Against". However, it will vary by company and the proxy
     must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote option for the
     particular company.

RISKMETRICS Group                                            www.riskmetrics.com

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from Inside Directors and Affiliated Outside Directors
(per the Classification of Directors below) when:

     -    The inside or affiliated outside director serves on any of the three
          key committees: audit, compensation, or nominating;

     -    The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so
          that the full board functions as that committee;

     -    The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if board attests
          that the independent directors fulfill the functions of such a
          committee;

     -    The full board is less than majority independent.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from the members of the Audit Committee if:

     -    The non-audit fees paid to the auditor are excessive (see discussion
          under Auditor Ratification);

     -    Poor accounting practices are identified which rise to a level of
          serious concern, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; and material
          weaknesses identified in Section 404 disclosures; or

     -    There is persuasive evidence that the audit committee entered into an
          inappropriate indemnification agreement with its auditor that limits
          the ability of the company, or its shareholders, to pursue legitimate
          legal recourse against the audit firm.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from the members of the Compensation Committee if:

     -    There is a negative correlation between the chief executive's pay and
          company performance (see discussion under Equity Compensation Plans);

     -    The company reprices underwater options for stock, cash or other
          consideration without prior shareholder approval, even if allowed in
          their equity plan;

     -    The company fails to submit one-time transfers of stock options to a
          shareholder vote;

     -    The company fails to fulfill the terms of a burn rate commitment they
          made to shareholders;

     -    The company has backdated options (see "Options Backdating" policy);

     -    The company has poor compensation practices (see "Poor Pay Practices"
          policy). Poor pay practices may warrant withholding votes from the CEO
          and potentially the entire board as well.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from directors, individually or the entire board, for
egregious actions or failure to replace management as appropriate.

FOOTNOTES:

(1)  "Affiliate" includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS
     uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent company as the standard for
     applying its affiliate designation.

     Act of 1934) include the chief

     executive, operating, financial, legal, technology, and accounting officers
     of a company (including the president, treasurer, secretary, controller, or
     any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, division or
     policy function). A non-employee director serving as an officer due to
     statutory requirements (e.g. corporate secretary) will be classified as an
     Affiliated Outsider. If the company provides additional disclosure that the
     director is not receiving additional compensation for serving in that
     capacity, then the director will be classified as an Independent Outsider.

(3)  Includes any former CEO of the company prior to the company's initial
     public offering (IPO).

(4)  ISS will look at the terms of the interim CEO's employment contract to
     determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension
     benefits or other such standard provisions typically contained in contracts
     of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also consider if a formal search
     process was underway for a full-time CEO at the time.

(5)  "Relative" follows the SEC's new definition of "immediate family members"
     which covers spouses, parents, children, step-parents, step-children,
     siblings, in-laws, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing
     the household of any director, nominee for director, executive officer, or
     significant shareholder of the company.

(6)  Professional services can be characterized as advisory in nature and
     generally include the following: investment banking / financial advisory
     services; commercial banking (beyond deposit services); investment
     services; insurance services; accounting/audit services; consulting
     services; marketing services; and legal services. The case of participation
     in a banking syndicate by a non-lead bank should be considered a
     transaction (and hence subject to the associated materiality test) rather
     than a professional relationship.

(7)  If the company makes or receives annual payments exceeding the greater of
     $200,000 or 5 percent of the recipient's gross revenues. (The recipient is
     the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction).

(8)  Interlocks include: (a) executive officers serving as directors on each
     other's compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a
     committee, on the board); or (b) executive officers sitting on each other's
     boards and at least one serves on the other's compensation or similar
     committees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board).

(9)  The operating involvement of the Founder with the company will be
     considered. Little to no operating involvement may cause ISS to deem the
     Founder as an independent outsider.

(10) For purposes of ISS' director independence classification, "material" will
     be defined as a standard of relationship (financial, personal or otherwise)
     that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially influence one's
     objectivity in the boardroom in a manner that would have a meaningful
     impact on an individual's ability to satisfy requisite fiduciary standards
     on behalf of shareholders.

previously the company was permitted to provide indemnification for at the
discretion of the company's board (i.e., "permissive indemnification") but that
previously the company was not required to indemnify.

Vote FOR only those proposals providing such expanded coverage in cases when a
director's or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if both of the following
apply:

     -    If the director was found to have acted in good faith and in a manner
          that he reasonably believed was in the best interests of the company;
          and

     -    If only the director's legal expenses would be covered.

     -    Designated lead director, elected by and from the independent board
          members with clearly delineated and comprehensive duties. (The role
          may alternatively reside with a presiding director, vice chairman, or
          rotating lead director; however the director must serve a minimum of
          one year in order to qualify as a lead director.) The duties should
          include, but are not limited to, the following:

               -    presides at all meetings of the board at which the chairman
                    is not present, including executive sessions of the
                    independent directors;

               -    serves as liaison between the chairman and the independent
                    directors;

                    sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;

               -    has the authority to call meetings of the independent
                    directors;

               -    if requested by major shareholders, ensures that he is
                    available for consultation and direct communication;

     -    The company publicly discloses a comparison of the duties of its
          independent lead director and its chairman;

     -    The company publicly discloses a sufficient explanation of why it
          chooses not to give the position of chairman to the independent lead
          director, and instead combine the chairman and CEO positions;

     -    Two-thirds independent board;

     -    All independent key committees;

     -    Established governance guidelines;

     -    The company should not have underperformed both its peers and index on
          the basis of both one-year and three-year total shareholder returns*,
          unless there has been a change in the Chairman/CEO position within
          that time; and

     -    The company does not have any problematic governance issues.

Vote FOR the proposal if the company does not provide disclosure with respect to
any or all of the bullet points above. If disclosure is provided, evaluate on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis.

*    The industry peer group used for this evaluation is the average of the 12
     companies in the same 6-digit GICS group that are closest in revenue to the
     company. To fail, the company must under-perform its index and industry
     group on all 4 measures (1 and 3 year on industry peers and index).

MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS/ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMITTEES

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that a majority or more of directors be
independent unless the board composition already meets the proposed threshold by
ISS' definition of independent outsider. (See Classification of Directors.)

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that board audit, compensation, and/or
nominating committees be composed exclusively of independent directors if they
currently do not meet that standard.

MAJORITY VOTE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

Generally vote FOR precatory and binding resolutions requesting that the board
change the company's bylaws to stipulate that directors need to be elected with
an affirmative majority of votes cast, provided it does not conflict with the
state law where the company is incorporated. Binding resolutions need to allow
for a carve-out for a plurality vote standard when there are more nominees than
board seats.

Companies are strongly encouraged to also adopt a post-election policy (also
know as a director resignation policy) that will provide guidelines so that the
company will promptly address the situation of a holdover director.

OFFICE OF THE BOARD

Generally vote FOR shareholders proposals requesting that the board establish an
Office of the Board of Directors in order to facilitate direct communications
between shareholders and non-management directors, unless the company has all of
the following:

     -    Established a communication structure that goes beyond the exchange
          requirements to facilitate the exchange of information between
          shareholders and members of the board;

     -    Effectively disclosed information with respect to this structure to
          its shareholders;

     -    Company has not ignored majority-supported shareholder proposals or a
          majority withhold vote on a director nominee; and

     -    The company has an independent chairman or a lead/presiding director,
          according to ISS' definition. This individual must be made available
          for periodic consultation and direct communication with major
          shareholders.

OPEN ACCESS

Vote shareholder proposals asking for open or proxy access on a CASE-BY-CASE
basis, taking into account:

     -    The ownership threshold proposed in the resolution;

     -    The proponent's rationale for the proposal at the targeted company in
          terms of board and director conduct.

PERFORMANCE TEST FOR DIRECTORS

On a CASE-BY-CASE basis, Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from directors of Russell 3000
companies that underperformed relative to their industry peers. The criterion
used to evaluate such underperformance is a combination of four performance
measures:

One measurement is a market-based performance metric and three measurements are
tied to the company's operational performance. The market performance metric in
the methodology is five-year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) on a relative basis
within each four-digit GICS group. The three operational performance metrics are
sales growth, EBITDA growth (or operating income growth for companies in the
financial sector), and pre-tax operating Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) (or
Return on Average Assets (ROAA) for companies in the financial sector) on a
relative basis within each four-digit GICS group. All four metrics will be
time-weighted as follows: 40 percent on the trailing 12 month period and 60
percent on the 48 month period prior to the trailing 12 months. This methodology
emphasizes the company's historical performance over a five-year period yet also
accounts for near-term changes in a company's performance.

The table below summarizes the framework:

</TABLE>

*    Metric applies to companies in the financial sector

Adopt a two-phase approach. In Year 1, the worst performers (bottom 5 percent)
within each of the 24 GICS groups receive are noted. In Year 2, consider a vote
AGAINST or WITHHOLD votes from director nominees if a company continues to be in
the bottom five percent within its GICS group for that respective year and shows
no improvement in its most recent trailing 12 months operating and market
performance relative to its peers in its GICS group. Take into account various
factors including:

     -    Year-to-date performance;

     -    Situational circumstances;

     -    Change in management/board;

     -    Overall governance practices.

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS

Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum amount of
stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on
the board. While stock ownership on the part of directors is desired, the
company should determine the appropriate ownership requirement.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking that the company adopt a
holding or retention period for its executives (for holding stock after the
vesting or exercise of equity awards), taking into account any stock ownership
requirements or holding period/retention ratio already in place and the actual
ownership level of executives.

TERM LIMITS

Vote AGAINST shareholder or management proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors through term limits. However, scrutinize boards where the average
tenure of all directors exceeds 15 years for independence from management and
for sufficient turnover to ensure that new perspectives are being added to the
board.

3. Proxy Contests

VOTING FOR DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on the election of directors in contested elections,
considering the following factors:

     -    Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
          industry;

     -    Management's track record;

     -    Background to the proxy contest;

     -    Qualifications of director nominees (both slates);

     -    Strategic plan of dissident slate and quality of critique against
          management;

     -    Likelihood that the proposed goals and objectives can be achieved
          (both slates);

     -    Stock ownership positions.

REIMBURSING PROXY SOLICITATION EXPENSES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to reimburse proxy solicitation expenses. When
voting in conjunction with support of a dissident slate, vote FOR the
reimbursement of all appropriate proxy solicitation expenses associated with the
election.

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals calling for the reimbursement of
reasonable costs incurred in connection with nominating one or more candidates
in a contested election where the following apply:

     -    The election of fewer than 50% of the directors to be elected is
          contested in the election;

     -    One or more of the dissident's candidates is elected;

     -    Shareholders are not permitted to cumulate their votes for directors;
          and

     -    The election occurred, and the expenses were incurred, after the
          adoption of this bylaw.

CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that corporations adopt confidential
voting, use independent vote tabulators, and use independent inspectors of
election, as long as the proposal includes a provision for proxy contests as
follows: In the case of a contested election, management should be permitted to
request that the dissident group honor its confidential voting policy. If the
dissidents agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents will not agree,
the confidential voting policy is waived.

Vote FOR management proposals to adopt confidential voting.

4. Antitakeover Defenses and Voting Related Issues

ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS/NOMINATIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on advance notice proposals, supporting those proposals which
allow shareholders to submit proposals as close to the meeting date as
reasonably possible and within the broadest window possible.

AMEND BYLAWS WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.

Vote FOR proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition
to shareholders.

POISON PILLS

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that the company submit its poison
pill to a shareholder vote or redeem it UNLESS the company has: (1) A
shareholder approved poison pill in place; or (2) The company has adopted a
policy concerning the adoption of a pill in the future specifying that the board
will only adopt a shareholder rights plan if either:

     -    Shareholders have approved the adoption of the plan; or

     -    The board, in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities,
          determines that it is in the best interest of shareholders under the
          circumstances to adopt a pill without the delay in adoption that would
          result from seeking stockholder approval (i.e., the "fiduciary out"
          provision). A poison pill adopted under this fiduciary out will be put
          to a shareholder ratification vote within 12 months of adoption or
          expire. If the pill is not approved by a majority of the votes cast on
          this issue, the plan will immediately terminate.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals calling for poison pills to be put to a vote
within a time period of less than one year after adoption. If the company has no
non-shareholder approved poison pill in place and has adopted a policy with the
provisions outlined above, vote AGAINST the proposal. If these conditions are
not met, vote FOR the proposal, but with the caveat that a vote within 12 months
would be considered sufficient.

Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals on poison pill ratification, focusing
on the features of the shareholder rights plan. Rights plans should contain the
following attributes:

     -    No lower than a 20% trigger, flip-in or flip-over;

     -    A term of no more than three years;

     -    No dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the
          ability of a future board to redeem the pill;

     -    Shareholder redemption feature (qualifying offer clause); if the board
          refuses to redeem the pill 90 days after a qualifying offer is
          announced, 10 percent of the shares may call a special meeting or seek
          a written consent to vote on rescinding the pill.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to take
action by written consent.

Vote FOR proposals to allow or make easier shareholder action by written
consent.

5. Mergers and Corporate Restructurings

OVERALL APPROACH

For mergers and acquisitions, review and evaluate the merits and drawbacks of
the proposed transaction, balancing various and sometimes countervailing factors
including:

     -    VALUATION - Is the value to be received by the target shareholders (or
          paid by the acquirer) reasonable? While the fairness opinion may
          provide an initial starting point for assessing valuation
          reasonableness, emphasis is placed on the offer premium, market
          reaction and strategic rationale.

     -    MARKET REACTION - How has the market responded to the proposed deal? A
          negative market reaction should cause closer scrutiny of a deal.

     -    STRATEGIC RATIONALE - Does the deal make sense strategically? From
          where is the value derived? Cost and revenue synergies should not be
          overly aggressive or optimistic, but reasonably achievable. Management
          should also have a favorable track record of successful integration of
          historical acquisitions.

     -    NEGOTIATIONS AND PROCESS - Were the terms of the transaction
          negotiated at arm's-length? Was the process fair and equitable? A fair
          process helps to ensure the best price for shareholders. Significant
          negotiation "wins" can also signify the deal makers' competency. The
          comprehensiveness of the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial
          auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder value.

     -    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction
          disproportionately and inappropriately as compared to non-insider
          shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and
          officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger
          than if they did not hold these interests. Consider whether these
          interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support
          or recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the "ISS
          Transaction Summary" section of this report is an aggregate figure
          that can in certain cases be a misleading indicator of the true value
          transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to
          be excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether
          a potential conflict exists.

     -    GOVERNANCE - Will the combined company have a better or worse
          governance profile than the current governance profiles of the
          respective parties to the transaction? If the governance profile is to
          change for the worse, the burden is on the company to prove that other
          issues (such as valuation) outweigh any deterioration in governance.

6. State of Incorporation

CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION PROVISIONS

Control share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting
rights when they contribute to ownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting
rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored by
approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus,
control share acquisition statutes effectively require a hostile bidder to put
its offer to a shareholder vote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder
continues buying up a large block of shares.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing
so would enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to
shareholders.

Vote AGAINST proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition
provisions.

Vote FOR proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.

CONTROL SHARE CASH-OUT PROVISIONS

Control share cash-out statutes give dissident shareholders the right to
"cash-out" of their position in a company at the expense of the shareholder who
has taken a control position. In other words, when an investor crosses a preset
threshold level, remaining shareholders are given the right to sell their shares
to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share cash-out statutes.

DISGORGEMENT PROVISIONS

Disgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a
certain percentage of a company's stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company
any profits realized from the sale of that company's stock purchased 24 months
before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the acquirer
occurring within a certain period of time (between 18 months and 24 months)
prior to the investor's gaining control status are subject to these
recapture-of-profits provisions.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.

FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that
stipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it
paid to acquire the control shares), evaluating factors such as the vote
required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required to repeal the
fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.

<PAGE>

RISKMETRICS Group                                            www.riskmetrics.com

Generally, vote AGAINST fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements
greater than a majority of disinterested shares.

FREEZE-OUT PROVISIONS

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of state freeze-out provisions. Freeze-out
provisions force an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a
company to wait a specified period of time before gaining control of the
company.

GREENMAIL

Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from individuals or groups seeking control of the company. Since only the
hostile party receives payment, usually at a substantial premium over the market
value of its shares, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.

Vote FOR proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or
otherwise restrict a company's ability to make greenmail payments.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other
charter or bylaw amendments.

REINCORPORATION PROPOSALS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to change a company's state of incorporation,
taking into consideration both financial and corporate governance concerns,
including:

     -    The reasons for reincorporating;

     -    A comparison of the governance provisions;

     -    Comparative economic benefits; and

     -    A comparison of the jurisdictional laws.

Vote FOR re-incorporation when the economic factors outweigh any neutral or
negative governance changes.

STAKEHOLDER PROVISIONS

Vote AGAINST proposals that ask the board to consider non-shareholder
constituencies or other non-financial effects when evaluating a merger or
business combination.

STATE ANTITAKEOVER STATUTES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to opt in or out of state takeover statutes
(including control share acquisition statutes, control share cash-out statutes,
freeze-out provisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison pill
endorsements, severance pay and labor contract provisions, anti-greenmail
provisions, and disgorgement provisions).

continue to operate as a going concern is uncertain.

In addition, for capital requests less than or equal to 300 percent of the
current authorized shares that marginally fail the calculated allowable cap
(i.e., exceed the allowable cap by no more than 5 percent), on a CASE-BY-CASE
basis, vote FOR the increase based on the company's performance and whether the
company's ongoing use of shares has shown prudence. Factors should include, at a
minimum, the following:

     -    Rationale;

     -    Good performance with respect to peers and index on a five-year total
          shareholder return basis;

     -    Absence of non-shareholder approved poison pill;

     -    Reasonable equity compensation burn rate;

     -    No non-shareholder approved pay plans; and

     -    Absence of egregious equity compensation practices.

DUAL-CLASS STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior
voting rights.

Vote AGAINST proposals at companies with dual-class capital structures to
increase the number of authorized shares of the class of stock that has superior
voting rights.

Vote FOR proposals to create a new class of nonvoting or sub-voting common stock
if:

     -    It is intended for financing purposes with minimal or no dilution to
          current shareholders;

     -    It is not designed to preserve the voting power of an insider or
          significant shareholder.

ISSUE STOCK FOR USE WITH RIGHTS PLAN

Vote AGAINST proposals that increase authorized common stock for the explicit
purpose of implementing a non-shareholder approved shareholder rights plan
(poison pill).

PREFERRED STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred
stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other
rights ("blank check" preferred stock).

Vote FOR proposals to create "declawed" blank check preferred stock (stock that
cannot be used as a takeover defense).

Vote FOR proposals to authorize preferred stock in cases where the company
specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and
the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.

Vote AGAINST proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred stock
authorized for issuance when no shares have been issued or reserved for a
specific purpose.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred
shares after analyzing the number of preferred shares available for issue given
a company's industry and performance in terms of shareholder returns.

into account the following:

     -    More simplified capital structure;

     -    Impact on voting power and dividends;

     -    Reasons for the reclassification;

of authorized shares will be proportionately reduced.

Vote FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split to avoid
delisting.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to implement a reverse stock split that do not
proportionately reduce the number of shares authorized for issue based on the
allowable increased calculated using the Capital Structure model.

value of the transaction against such factors as:

     -    Adverse governance changes;

8. Executive and Director Compensation

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on equity-based compensation plans. Vote AGAINST the equity
plan if any of the following factors apply:

     -    The total cost of the company's equity plans is unreasonable;

     -    The plan expressly permits the repricing of stock options without
          prior shareholder approval;

     -    There is a disconnect between CEO pay and the company's performance;

     -    The company's three year burn rate exceeds the greater of 2% and the
          mean plus one standard deviation of its industry group; or

     -    The plan is a vehicle for poor pay practices.

Each of these factors is described below:

COST OF EQUITY PLANS

Generally, vote AGAINST equity plans if the cost is unreasonable. For
non-employee director plans, vote FOR the plan if certain factors are met (see
Director Compensation section).

The cost of the equity plans is expressed as Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT),
which is measured using a binomial option pricing model that assesses the amount
of shareholders' equity flowing out of the company to employees and directors.
SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value,
and includes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and
shares granted but unexercised. All award types are valued. For omnibus plans,
unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of awards (for
example, full value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be
granted will be the most expensive types. See discussion of specific types of
awards.

The Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls below the
company-specific allowable cap. The allowable cap is determined as follows: The
top quartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry
Classification Standard GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each
industry are established based on these top performers' historic SVT. Regression
analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly
correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or
downwards for the specific company by plugging the company-specific performance
measures, size and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to arrive
at the company's allowable cap.

REPRICING PROVISIONS

Vote AGAINST plans that expressly permit the repricing of underwater stock
options without prior shareholder approval, even if the cost of the plan is
reasonable. Also, vote AGAINST OR WITHHOLD from members of the Compensation
Committee who approved and/or implemented an option exchange program by
repricing and buying out underwater options for stock, cash or other
consideration or canceling underwater options and regranting options with a
lower exercise price without prior shareholder approval, even if such repricings
are allowed in their equity plan.

<PAGE>

RISKMETRICS Group                                            www.riskmetrics.com

Vote AGAINST plans if the company has a history of repricing options without
shareholder approval, and the applicable listing standards would not preclude
them from doing so.

PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE DISCONNECT

Generally vote AGAINST plans in which:

     -    There is a disconnect between the CEO's pay and company performance
          (an increase in pay and a decrease in performance);

     -    The main source of the pay increase (over half) is equity-based; and

     -    The CEO is a participant of the equity proposal.

Performance decreases are based on negative one- and three-year total
shareholder returns. CEO pay increases are based on the CEO's total direct
compensation (salary, cash bonus, value of non-equity incentive payouts, present
value of stock options, face value of restricted stock, target value of
performance-based awards, change in pension value and nonqualified deferred
compensation earnings, and all other compensation) increasing over the previous
year.

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD votes from the Compensation Committee members when the
company has a pay-for-performance disconnect.

On a CASE-BY-CASE basis, vote for equity plans and FOR compensation committee
members with a pay-for-performance disconnect if compensation committee members
can present strong and compelling evidence of improved committee performance.
This evidence must go beyond the usual compensation committee report disclosure.
This additional evidence necessary includes all of the following:

     -    The compensation committee has reviewed all components of the CEO's
          compensation, including the following:

               -    Base salary, bonus, long-term incentives;

               -    Accumulative realized and unrealized stock option and
                    restricted stock gains;

               -    Dollar value of perquisites and other personal benefits to
                    the CEO and the total cost to the company;

               -    Earnings and accumulated payment obligations under the
                    company's nonqualified deferred compensation program;

               -    Actual projected payment obligations under the company's
                    supplemental executive retirement plan (SERPs).

     -    A tally sheet with all the above components should be disclosed for
          the following termination scenarios:

               -    Payment if termination occurs within 12 months: $_____;

               -    Payment if "not for cause" termination occurs within 12
                    months: $_____;

               -    Payment if "change of control" termination occurs within 12
                    months: $_____.

     -    The compensation committee is committed to providing additional
          information on the named executives' annual cash bonus program and/or
          long-term incentive cash plan for the current fiscal year. The
          compensation committee will provide full disclosure of the qualitative
          and quantitative performance criteria and hurdle rates used to
          determine the payouts of the cash program. From this


                  2008 US PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES SUMMARY -30-

          disclosure, shareholders will know the minimum level of performance
          required for any cash bonus to be delivered, as well as the maximum
          cash bonus payable for superior performance.

The repetition of the compensation committee report does not meet ISS'
requirement of compelling and strong evidence of improved disclosure. The level
of transparency and disclosure is at the highest level where shareholders can
understand the mechanics of the annual cash bonus and/or long-term incentive
cash plan based on the additional disclosure.

     -    The compensation committee is committed to granting a substantial
          portion of performance-based equity awards to the named executive
          officers. A substantial portion of performance-based awards would be
          at least 50 percent of the shares awarded to each of the named
          executive officers. Performance-based equity awards are earned or paid
          out based on the achievement of company performance targets. The
          company will disclose the details of the performance criteria (e.g.,
          return on equity) and the hurdle rates (e.g., 15 percent) associated
          with the performance targets. From this disclosure, shareholders will
          know the minimum level of performance required for any equity grants
          to be made. The performance-based equity awards do not refer to
          non-qualified stock options(3) or performance-accelerated grants.(4)
          Instead, performance-based equity awards are performance-contingent
          grants where the individual will not receive the equity grant by not
          meeting the target performance and vice versa.

The level of transparency and disclosure is at the highest level where
shareholders can understand the mechanics of the performance-based equity awards
based on the additional disclosure.

     -    The compensation committee has the sole authority to hire and fire
          outside compensation consultants. The role of the outside compensation
          consultant is to assist the compensation committee to analyze
          executive pay packages or contracts and understand the company's
          financial measures.

THREE-YEAR BURN RATE/BURN RATE COMMITMENT

Generally vote AGAINST plans if the company's most recent three-year burn rate
exceeds one standard deviation in excess of the industry mean (per the following
Burn Rate Table) and is over 2 percent of common shares outstanding. The
three-year burn rate policy does not apply to non-employee director plans unless
outside directors receive a significant portion of shares each year.

The annual burn rate is calculated as follows:

Annual Burn rate = (# of options granted + # of full value shares awarded *
Multiplier) / Weighted Average common shares outstanding)

- ----------
(3)  Non-qualified stock options are not performance-based awards unless the
     grant or the vesting of the stock options is tied to the achievement of a
     pre-determined and disclosed performance measure. A rising stock market
     will generally increase share prices of all companies, despite of the
     company's underlying performance.

(4)  Performance-accelerated grants are awards that vest earlier based on the
     achievement of a specified measure. However, these grants will ultimately
     vest over time even without the attainment of the goal(s).

However, vote FOR equity plans if the company fails this burn rate test but the
company commits in a public filing to a three-year average burn rate equal to
its GICS group burn rate mean plus one standard deviation (or 2%, whichever is
greater), assuming all other conditions for voting FOR the plan have been met.

If a company fails to fulfill its burn rate commitment, vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD
from the compensation committee.

POOR PAY PRACTICES

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from compensation committee members, CEO, and
potentially the entire board, if the company has poor compensation practices.
Vote AGAINST equity plans if the plan is a vehicle for poor compensation
practices.

The following practices, while not exhaustive, are examples of poor compensation
practices that may warrant voting against or withholding votes:

     -    Egregious employment contracts:

          -    Contracts containing multi-year guarantees for salary increases,
               bonuses, and equity compensation;

     -    Excessive perks:

          -    Overly generous cost and/or reimbursement of taxes for personal
               use of corporate aircraft, personal security systems maintenance
               and/or installation, car allowances, and/or other excessive
               arrangements relative to base salary;

     -    Abnormally large bonus payouts without justifiable performance linkage
          or proper disclosure:

          -    Performance metrics that are changed, canceled, or replaced
               during the performance period without adequate explanation of the
               action and the link to performance;

     -    Egregious pension/SERP (supplemental executive retirement plan)
          payouts:

          -    Inclusion of additional years of service not worked that result
               in significant payouts

          -    Inclusion of performance-based equity awards in the pension
               calculation;

     -    New CEO with overly generous new hire package:

          -    Excessive "make whole" provisions;

          -    Any of the poor pay practices listed in this policy;

     -    Excessive severance and/or change-in-control provisions:

          -    Inclusion of excessive change-in-control or severance payments,
               especially those with a multiple in excess of 3X cash pay;

          -    Severance paid for a "performance termination," (i.e., due to the
               executive's failure to perform job functions at the appropriate
               level);

          -    Change-in-control payouts without loss of job or substantial
               diminution of job duties (single-triggered);

          -    Perquisites for former executives such as car allowances,
               personal use of corporate aircraft, or other inappropriate
               arrangements;

     -    Poor disclosure practices:

          -    Unclear explanation of how the CEO is involved in the pay setting
               process;

          -    Retrospective performance targets and methodology not discussed;

          -    Methodology for benchmarking practices and/or peer group not
               disclosed and explained;

     -    Internal Pay Disparity:

          -    Excessive differential between CEO total pay and that of next
               highest-paid named executive officer (NEO);

     -    Options backdating (covered in a separate policy);

     -    Other excessive compensation payouts or poor pay practices at the
          company.

SPECIFIC TREATMENT OF CERTAIN AWARD TYPES IN EQUITY PLAN EVALUATIONS:

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS

Options that have Dividend Equivalent Rights (DERs) associated with them will
have a higher calculated award value than those without DERs under the binomial
model, based on the value of these dividend streams. The higher value will be
applied to new shares, shares available under existing plans, and shares awarded
but not exercised per the plan specifications. DERS transfer more shareholder
equity to employees and non-employee directors and this cost should be captured.

LIBERAL SHARE RECYCLING PROVISIONS

Under net share counting provisions, shares tendered by an option holder to pay
for the exercise of an option, shares withheld for taxes or shares repurchased
by the company on the open market can be recycled back into the equity plan for
awarding again. All awards with such provisions should be valued as full-value
awards. Stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs) will also be considered
as full-value awards if a company counts only the net shares issued to employees
towards their plan reserve.

OPTION OVERHANG COST

Companies with sustained positive stock performance and high overhang cost (the
overhang alone exceeds the allowable cap) attributable to in-the-money options
outstanding in excess of six years may warrant a carve-out of these options from
the overhang as long as the dilution attributable to the new share request is
reasonable and the company exhibits sound compensation practices. Consider, on a
CASE-BY-CASE basis, a carve-out of a portion of cost attributable to overhang,
considering the following criteria:

     -    PERFORMANCE: Companies with sustained positive stock performance will
          merit greater scrutiny. Five-year total shareholder return (TSR),
          year-over-year performance, and peer performance could play a
          significant role in this determination.

     -    OVERHANG DISCLOSURE: Assess whether optionees have held in-the-money
          options for a prolonged period (thus reflecting their confidence in
          the prospects of the company). Note that this assessment would require
          additional disclosure regarding a company's overhang. Specifically,
          the following disclosure would be required:

               -    The number of in-the-money options outstanding in excess of
                    six or more years with a corresponding weighted average
                    exercise price and weighted average contractual remaining
                    term;

               -    The number of all options outstanding less than six years
                    and underwater options outstanding in excess of six years
                    with a corresponding weighted average exercise price and
                    weighted average contractual remaining term;

               -    The general vesting provisions of option grants; and

               -    The distribution of outstanding option grants with respect
                    to the named executive officers;

     -    DILUTION: Calculate the expected duration of the new share request in
          addition to all shares currently available for grant under the equity
          compensation program, based on the company's three-year average burn
          rate (or a burn-rate commitment that the company makes for future
          years). The expected duration will be calculated by multiplying the
          company's unadjusted (options and full-value awards accounted on a
          one-for-one basis) three-year average burn rate by the most recent
          fiscal year's weighted average shares outstanding (as used in the
          company's calculation of basic EPS) and divide the

          sum of the new share request and all available shares under the
          company's equity compensation program by the product. For example, an
          expected duration in excess of five years could be considered
          problematic; and

     -    COMPENSATION PRACTICES: An evaluation of overall practices could
          include: (1) stock option repricing provisions, (2) high concentration
          ratios (of grants to top executives), or (3) additional practices
          outlined in the Poor Pay Practices policy.

OTHER COMPENSATION PROPOSALS AND POLICIES

401(K) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Vote FOR proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for employees.

ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (SAY-ON-PAY) MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on management proposals for an advisory vote on executive
compensation. Vote AGAINST these resolutions in cases where boards have failed
to demonstrate good stewardship of investors' interests regarding executive
compensation practices. The following principles and factors should be
considered:

1. The following FIVE GLOBAL PRINCIPLES apply to all markets:

     -    Maintain appropriate pay-for-performance alignment with emphasis on
          long-term shareholder value: This principle encompasses overall
          executive pay practices, which must be designed to attract, retain,
          and appropriately motivate the key employees who drive shareholder
          value creation over the long term. It will take into consideration,
          among other factors: the linkage between pay and performance; the mix
          between fixed and variable pay; performance goals; and equity-based
          plan costs;

     -    Avoid arrangements that risk "pay for failure": This principle
          addresses the use and appropriateness of long or indefinite contracts,
          excessive severance packages, and guaranteed compensation;

     -    Maintain an independent and effective compensation committee: This
          principle promotes oversight of executive pay programs by directors
          with appropriate skills, knowledge, experience, and a sound process
          for compensation decision-making (e.g., including access to
          independent expertise and advice when needed);

     -    Provide shareholders with clear, comprehensive compensation
          disclosures: This principle underscores the importance of informative
          and timely disclosures that enable shareholders to evaluate executive
          pay practices fully and fairly;

     -    Avoid inappropriate pay to non-executive directors: This principle
          recognizes the interests of shareholders in ensuring that compensation
          to outside directors does not compromise their independence and
          ability to make appropriate judgments in overseeing managers' pay and
          performance. At the market level, it may incorporate a variety of
          generally accepted best practices.

2. For U.S. companies, vote CASE-BY-CASE considering the following factors in
the context of each company's specific circumstances and the board's disclosed
rationale for its practices:

RELATIVE CONSIDERATIONS:

     -    Assessment of performance metrics relative to business strategy, as
          discussed and explained in the CD&A;


                  2008 US PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES SUMMARY -35-

<PAGE>

RISKMETRICS Group                                           www.riskmetrics.com

     -    Evaluation of peer groups used to set target pay or award
          opportunities;

     -    Alignment of company performance and executive pay trends over time
          (e.g., performance down: pay down);

     -    Assessment of disparity between total pay of the CEO and other Named
          Executive Officers (NEOs).

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:

     -    Balance of fixed versus performance-driven pay;

     -    Assessment of excessive practices with respect to perks, severance
          packages, supplemental executive pension plans, and burn rates.

COMMUNICATION CONSIDERATIONS:

     -    Evaluation of information and board rationale provided in CD&A about
          how compensation is determined (e.g., why certain elements and pay
          targets are used, and specific incentive plan goals, especially
          retrospective goals);

     -    Assessment of board's responsiveness to investor input and engagement
          on compensation issues (e.g., in responding to majority-supported
          shareholder proposals on executive pay topics).

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on compensation plans for non-employee directors, based on the
cost of the plans against the company's allowable cap.

On occasion, director stock plans that set aside a relatively small number of
shares when combined with employee or executive stock compensation plans will
exceed the allowable cap. Vote for the plan if ALL of the following qualitative
factors in the board's compensation are met and disclosed in the proxy
statement:

     -    Director stock ownership guidelines with a minimum of three times the
          annual cash retainer.

     -    Vesting schedule or mandatory holding/deferral period:

          -    A minimum vesting of three years for stock options or restricted
               stock; or

          -    Deferred stock payable at the end of a three-year deferral
               period.

     -    Mix between cash and equity:

          -    A balanced mix of cash and equity, for example 40% cash/60%
               equity or 50% cash/50% equity; or

          -    If the mix is heavier on the equity component, the vesting
               schedule or deferral period should be more stringent, with the
               lesser of five years or the term of directorship.

     -    No retirement/benefits and perquisites provided to non-employee
          directors; and

     -    Detailed disclosure provided on cash and equity compensation delivered
          to each non-employee director for the most recent fiscal year in a
          table. The column headers for the table may include the following:
          name of each non-employee director, annual retainer, board meeting
          fees, committee retainer, committee-meeting fees, and equity grants.

DIRECTOR RETIREMENT PLANS

Vote AGAINST retirement plans for non-employee directors.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to eliminate retirement plans for non-employee
directors.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)

Vote FOR proposals to implement an ESOP or increase authorized shares for
existing ESOPs, unless the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is excessive
(more than five percent of outstanding shares).

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS-- QUALIFIED PLANS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on qualified employee stock purchase plans. Vote FOR employee
stock purchase plans where all of the following apply:

     -    Purchase price is at least 85 percent of fair market value;

     -    Offering period is 27 months or less; and

     -    The number of shares allocated to the plan is ten percent or less of
          the outstanding shares.

Vote AGAINST qualified employee stock purchase plans where any of the following
apply:

     -    Purchase price is less than 85 percent of fair market value; or

     -    Offering period is greater than 27 months; or

     -    The number of shares allocated to the plan is more than ten percent of
          the outstanding shares.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS-- NON-QUALIFIED PLANS

Vote CASE-by-CASE on nonqualified employee stock purchase plans. Vote FOR
nonqualified employee stock purchase plans with all the following features:

     -    Broad-based participation (i.e., all employees of the company with the
          exclusion of individuals with 5 percent or more of beneficial
          ownership of the company);

     -    Limits on employee contribution, which may be a fixed dollar amount or
          expressed as a percent of base salary;

     -    Company matching contribution up to 25 percent of employee's
          contribution, which is effectively a discount of 20 percent from
          market value;

     -    No discount on the stock price on the date of purchase since there is
          a company matching contribution.

Vote AGAINST nonqualified employee stock purchase plans when any of the plan
features do not meet the above criteria. If the company matching contribution
exceeds 25 percent of employee's contribution, evaluate the cost of the plan
against its allowable cap.

INCENTIVE BONUS PLANS AND TAX DEDUCTIBILITY PROPOSALS (OBRA-RELATED COMPENSATION
PROPOSALS)

Vote FOR proposals that simply amend shareholder-approved compensation plans to
include administrative features or place a cap on the annual grants any one
participant may receive to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) of the
Internal Revenue Code.

Vote FOR proposals to add performance goals to existing compensation plans to
comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) unless they are clearly
inappropriate.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on amendments to existing plans to increase shares reserved
and to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the provisions of Section
162(m) as long as the plan does not exceed the allowable cap and the plan does
not violate any of the supplemental policies.

Generally vote FOR cash or cash and stock bonus plans that are submitted to
shareholders for the purpose of exempting compensation from taxes under the
provisions of Section 162(m) if no increase in shares is requested.

OPTIONS BACKDATING

In cases where a company has practiced options backdating, vote AGAINST or
WITHHOLD on a CASE-BY-CASE basis from the members of the compensation committee,
depending on the severity of the practices and the subsequent corrective actions
on the part of the board. Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from the compensation
committee members who oversaw the questionable options grant practices or from
current compensation committee members who fail to respond to the issue
proactively, depending on several factors, including, but not limited to:

     -    Reason and motive for the options backdating issue, such as
          inadvertent vs. deliberate grant date changes;

     -    Length of time of options backdating;

     -    Size of restatement due to options backdating;

     -    Corrective actions taken by the board or compensation committee, such
          as canceling or repricing backdated options, or recoupment of option
          gains on backdated grants;

     -    Adoption of a grant policy that prohibits backdating, and creation of
          a fixed grant schedule or window period for equity grants going
          forward.

OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAMS/REPRICING OPTIONS

Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals seeking approval to exchange/reprice
options taking into consideration:

     -    Historic trading patterns--the stock price should not be so volatile
          that the options are likely to be back "in-the-money" over the near
          term;

     -    Rationale for the re-pricing--was the stock price decline beyond
          management's control?

     -    Is this a value-for-value exchange?

     -    Are surrendered stock options added back to the plan reserve?

     -    Option vesting--does the new option vest immediately or is there a
          black-out period?

     -    Term of the option--the term should remain the same as that of the
          replaced option;

     -    Exercise price--should be set at fair market or a premium to market;

     -    Participants--executive officers and directors should be excluded.

If the surrendered options are added back to the equity plans for re-issuance,
then also take into consideration the company's three-year average burn rate.

In addition to the above considerations, evaluate the intent, rationale, and
timing of the repricing proposal. The proposal should clearly articulate why the
board is choosing to conduct an exchange program at this point in time.
Repricing underwater options after a recent precipitous drop in the company's
stock price demonstrates poor timing. Repricing after a recent decline in stock
price triggers additional scrutiny and a potential AGAINST vote on the proposal.
At a minimum, the decline should not have happened within the past year. Also,
consider the terms of the surrendered options, such as the grant date, exercise
price and vesting schedule. Grant dates of surrendered options should be far
enough back (two to three years) so as not to

<PAGE>

RISKMETRICS Group                                           www.riskmetrics.com

suggest that repricings are being done to take advantage of short-term downward
price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options should be
above the 52-week high for the stock price.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.

STOCK PLANS IN LIEU OF CASH

Vote CASE-by-CASE on plans that provide participants with the option of taking
all or a portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.

Vote FOR non-employee director-only equity plans that provide a
dollar-for-dollar cash-for-stock exchange.

Vote CASE-by-CASE on plans which do not provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for
stock exchange. In cases where the exchange is not dollar-for-dollar, the
request for new or additional shares for such equity program will be considered
using the binomial option pricing model. In an effort to capture the total cost
of total compensation, ISS will not make any adjustments to carve out the
in-lieu-of cash compensation.

TRANSFER PROGRAMS OF STOCK OPTIONS

One-time Transfers: Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from compensation committee members
if they fail to submit one-time transfers to shareholders for approval.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on one-time transfers. Vote FOR if:

     -    Executive officers and non-employee directors are excluded from
          participating;

     -    Stock options are purchased by third-party financial institutions at a
          discount to their fair value using option pricing models such as
          Black-Scholes or a Binomial Option Valuation or other appropriate
          financial models;

     -    There is a two-year minimum holding period for sale proceeds (cash or
          stock) for all participants.

Additionally, management should provide a clear explanation of why options are
being transferred and whether the events leading up to the decline in stock
price were beyond management's control. A review of the company's historic stock
price volatility should indicate if the options are likely to be back
"in-the-money" over the near term.

Ongoing TSO program: Vote against equity plan proposals if the details of
ongoing TSO programs are not provided to shareholders. Since TSOs will be one of
the award types under a stock plan, the ongoing TSO program, structure and
mechanics must be disclosed to shareholders. The specific criteria to be
considered in evaluating these proposals include, but not limited, to the
following:

     -    Eligibility;

     -    Vesting;

     -    Bid-price;

     -    Term of options;

     -    Transfer value to third-party financial institution, employees and the
          company.

Amendments to existing plans that allow for introduction of transferability of
stock options should make clear that only options granted post-amendment shall
be transferable.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS ON COMPENSATION

ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (SAY-ON-PAY)

Generally, vote FOR shareholder proposals that call for non-binding shareholder
ratification of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers and the
accompanying narrative disclosure of material factors provided to understand the
Summary Compensation Table.

COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS- DISCLOSURE OF BOARD OR COMPANY'S UTILIZATION

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals seeking disclosure regarding the
Company, Board, or Compensation Committee's use of compensation consultants,
such as company name, business relationship(s) and fees paid.

DISCLOSURE/SETTING LEVELS OR TYPES OF COMPENSATION FOR EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS

Generally, vote FOR shareholder proposals seeking additional disclosure of
executive and director pay information, provided the information requested is
relevant to shareholders' needs, would not put the company at a competitive
disadvantage relative to its industry, and is not unduly burdensome to the
company.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals seeking to set absolute levels on
compensation or otherwise dictate the amount or form of compensation.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals requiring director fees be paid in stock
only.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on all other shareholder proposals regarding executive and
director pay, taking into account company performance, pay level versus peers,
pay level versus industry, and long-term corporate outlook.

PAY FOR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals based on a case-by-case analysis that
requests the board establish a pay-for-superior performance standard in the
company's executive compensation plan for senior executives. The proposal has
the following principles:

     -    Sets compensation targets for the Plan's annual and long-term
          incentive pay components at or below the peer group median;

     -    Delivers a majority of the Plan's target long-term compensation
          through performance-vested, not simply time-vested, equity awards;

     -    Provides the strategic rationale and relative weightings of the
          financial and non-financial performance metrics or criteria used in
          the annual and performance-vested long-term incentive components of
          the plan;

     -    Establishes performance targets for each plan financial metric
          relative to the performance of the company's peer companies;


                  2008 US PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES SUMMARY -40-

<PAGE>

RISKMETRICS Group                                           www.riskmetrics.com

     -    Limits payment under the annual and performance-vested long-term
          incentive components of the plan to when the company's performance on
          its selected financial performance metrics exceeds peer group median
          performance.

Consider the following factors in evaluating this proposal:

     -    What aspects of the company's annual and long-term equity incentive
          programs are performance driven?

     -    If the annual and long-term equity incentive programs are performance
          driven, are the performance criteria and hurdle rates disclosed to
          shareholders or are they benchmarked against a disclosed peer group?

     -    Can shareholders assess the correlation between pay and performance
          based on the current disclosure?

     -    What type of industry and stage of business cycle does the company
          belong to?

PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposal requesting that a significant amount
of future long-term incentive compensation awarded to senior executives shall be
performance-based and requesting that the board adopt and disclose challenging
performance metrics to shareholders, based on the following analytical steps:

- -    First, vote FOR shareholder proposals advocating the use of
     performance-based equity awards, such as performance contingent options or
     restricted stock, indexed options or premium-priced options, unless the
     proposal is overly restrictive or if the company has demonstrated that it
     is using a "substantial" portion of performance-based awards for its top
     executives. Standard stock options and performance-accelerated awards do
     not meet the criteria to be considered as performance-based awards.
     Further, premium-priced options should have a premium of at least 25
     percent and higher to be considered performance-based awards.

- -    Second, assess the rigor of the company's performance-based equity program.
     If the bar set for the performance-based program is too low based on the
     company's historical or peer group comparison, generally vote FOR the
     proposal. Furthermore, if target performance results in an above target
     payout, vote FOR the shareholder proposal due to program's poor design. If
     the company does not disclose the performance metric of the
     performance-based equity program, vote FOR the shareholder proposal
     regardless of the outcome of the first step to the test.

In general, vote FOR the shareholder proposal if the company does not meet both
of the above two steps.

PENSION PLAN INCOME ACCOUNTING

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals to exclude pension plan income in the
calculation of earnings used in determining executive bonuses/compensation.

PRE-ARRANGED TRADING PLANS (10B5-1 PLANS)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals calling for certain principles
regarding the use of prearranged trading plans (10b5-1 plans) for executives.
These principles include:

     -    Adoption, amendment, or termination of a 10b5-1 Plan must be disclosed
          within two business days in a Form 8-K;

     -    Amendment or early termination of a 10b5-1 Plan is allowed only under
          extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the board;


                  2008 US PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES SUMMARY -41-

<PAGE>

RISKMETRICS Group                                           www.riskmetrics.com

     -    Ninety days must elapse between adoption or amendment of a 10b5-1 Plan
          and initial trading under the plan;

     -    Reports on Form 4 must identify transactions made pursuant to a 10b5-1
          Plan;

     -    An executive may not trade in company stock outside the 10b5-1 Plan.

     -    Trades under a 10b5-1 Plan must be handled by a broker who does not
          handle other securities transactions for the executive.

RECOUP BONUSES

Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to recoup unearned incentive bonuses or
other incentive payments made to senior executives if it is later determined
that fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly contributed to a restatement
of financial results that led to the awarding of unearned incentive
compensation, taking into consideration:

     -    If the company has adopted a formal recoupment bonus policy; or

     -    If the company has chronic restatement history or material financial
          problems.

SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS FOR EXECUTIVES/GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requiring that golden parachutes or executive
severance agreements be submitted for shareholder ratification, unless the
proposal requires shareholder approval prior to entering into employment
contracts.

Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis on proposals to ratify or cancel golden parachutes.
An acceptable parachute should include, but is not limited to, the following:

     -    The triggering mechanism should be beyond the control of management;

     -    The amount should not exceed three times base amount (defined as the
          average annual taxable W-2 compensation during the five years prior to
          the year in which the change of control occurs;

     -    Change-in-control payments should be double-triggered, i.e., (1) after
          a change in control has taken place, and (2) termination of the
          executive as a result of the change in control. Change in control is
          defined as a change in the company ownership structure.

SHARE BUYBACK HOLDING PERIODS

Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals prohibiting executives from selling
shares of company stock during periods in which the company has announced that
it may or will be repurchasing shares of its stock. Vote FOR the proposal when
there is a pattern of abuse by executives exercising options or selling shares
during periods of share buybacks.

STOCK OWNERSHIP OR HOLDING PERIOD GUIDELINES

Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum amount of
stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on
the board. While ISS favors stock ownership on the part of directors, the
company should determine the appropriate ownership requirement.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to adopt holding
period or retention ratios for their executives, taking into account:

     -    Whether the company has any holding period, retention ratio, or
          officer ownership requirements in place. These should consist of:

RISKMETRICS Group                                           www.riskmetrics.com

               -    Rigorous stock ownership guidelines, or

               -    A short-term holding period requirement (six months to one
                    year) coupled with a significant long-term ownership
                    requirement, or

               -    A meaningful retention ratio,

     -    Actual officer stock ownership and the degree to which it meets or
          exceeds the proponent's suggested holding period/retention ratio or
          the company's own stock ownership or retention requirements.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS (SERPS)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary
benefits contained in SERP agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company's
executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered
under employee-wide plans.

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting to limit the executive
benefits provided under the company's supplemental executive retirement plan
(SERP) by limiting covered compensation to a senior executive's annual salary
and excluding of all incentive or bonus pay from the plan's definition of
covered compensation used to establish such benefits.

TAX GROSS-UP PROPOSALS

Generally vote FOR proposals calling for companies to adopt a policy of not
providing tax gross-up payments to executives, except in situations where
gross-ups are provided pursuant to a plan, policy, or arrangement applicable to
management employees of the company, such as a relocation or expatriate tax
equalization policy.

9. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Issues

ANIMAL WELFARE

ANIMAL TESTING

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to phase out the use of animals in product
testing unless:

     -    The company is conducting animal testing programs that are unnecessary
          or not required by regulation;

     -    The company is conducting animal testing when suitable alternatives
          are accepted and used at peer firms;

     -    The company has been the subject of recent, significant controversy
          related to its testing programs.

ANIMAL WELFARE POLICIES

Generally vote FOR proposals seeking a report on the company's animal welfare
standards unless:

     -    The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards
          and monitors compliance;

     -    The company's standards are comparable to or better than those of peer
          firms; and

     -    There are no recent, significant fines or litigation related to the
          company's treatment of animals.

CONTROLLED ATMOSPHERE KILLING (CAK)

Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting the implementation of CAK methods at
company and/or supplier operations unless such methods are required by
legislation or generally accepted as the industry standard.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals requesting a report on the feasibility of
implementing CAK methods, considering the availability of existing research
conducted by the company or industry groups on this topic and any fines or
litigation related to current animal processing procedures at the company.

CONSUMER ISSUES

GENETICALLY MODIFIED INGREDIENTS

Generally, vote AGAINST proposals asking restaurants and food retail companies
to voluntarily label genetically engineered (GE) ingredients in their products
or alternatively to provide interim labeling and eventually eliminate GE
ingredients due to the costs and feasibility of labeling and/or phasing out the
use of GE ingredients.

Vote CASE-BY CASE on proposals asking food supply and genetic research companies
to voluntarily label genetically engineered (GE) ingredients in their products
or alternatively to provide interim labeling and eventually eliminate GE
ingredients due to the costs and feasibility of labeling and/or phasing out the
use of GE ingredients.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking for a report on the feasibility of
labeling products containing GE ingredients taking into account:

     -    The relevance of the proposal in terms of the company's business and
          the proportion of it affected by the resolution;


                  2008 US PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES SUMMARY -44-

<PAGE>

RISKMETRICS Group                                           www.riskmetrics.com

     -    The quality of the company's disclosure on GE product labeling and
          related voluntary initiatives and how this disclosure compares with
          peer company disclosure;

     -    Company's current disclosure on the feasibility of GE product
          labeling, including information on the related costs;

     -    Any voluntary labeling initiatives undertaken or considered by the
          company.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals seeking a report on the health and
environmental effects of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Health studies
of this sort are better undertaken by regulators and the scientific community.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to completely phase out GE ingredients from the
company's products or proposals asking for reports outlining the steps necessary
to eliminate GE ingredients from the company's products. Such resolutions
presuppose that there are proven health risks to GE ingredients (an issue better
left to federal regulators) that outweigh the economic benefits derived from
biotechnology.

CONSUMER LENDING

Vote CASE-BY CASE on requests for reports on the company's lending guidelines
and procedures, including the establishment of a board committee for oversight,
taking into account:

     -    Whether the company has adequately disclosed mechanisms in place to
          prevent abusive lending practices;

     -    Whether the company has adequately disclosed the financial risks of
          the lending products in question;

     -    Whether the company has been subject to violations of lending laws or
          serious lending controversies;

     -    Peer companies' policies to prevent abusive lending practices.

PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING

Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting that companies implement specific
price restraints on pharmaceutical products unless the company fails to adhere
to legislative guidelines or industry norms in its product pricing.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals requesting that the company evaluate their
product pricing considering:

     -    The existing level of disclosure on pricing policies;

     -    Deviation from established industry pricing norms;

     -    The company's existing initiatives to provide its products to needy
          consumers;

     -    Whether the proposal focuses on specific products or geographic
          regions.

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT REIMPORTATION

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting that companies report on the financial
and legal impact of their policies regarding prescription drug reimportation
unless such information is already publicly disclosed.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting that companies adopt specific
policies to encourage or constrain prescription drug reimportation.

PRODUCT SAFETY AND TOXIC MATERIALS

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting the company to report on its policies,
initiatives/procedures, and oversight mechanisms related to toxic materials
and/or product safety in its supply chain, unless:

     -    The company already discloses similar information through existing
          reports or policies such as a Supplier Code of Conduct and/or a
          sustainability report;

     -    The company has formally committed to the implementation of a toxic
          materials and/or product safety and supply chain reporting and
          monitoring program based on industry norms or similar standards within
          a specified time frame; and

     -    The company has not been recently involved in relevant significant
          controversies or violations.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on resolutions requesting that companies develop a feasibility
assessment to phase-out of certain toxic chemicals and/or evaluate and disclose
the potential financial and legal risks associated with utilizing certain
chemicals, considering:

     -    Current regulations in the markets in which the company operates;

     -    Recent significant controversy, litigation, or fines stemming from
          toxic chemicals or ingredients at the company; and

     -    The current level of disclosure on this topic.

Generally vote AGAINST resolutions requiring that a company reformulate its
products.

TOBACCO

Most tobacco-related proposals should be evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis,
taking into account the following factors:

Advertising to youth:

     -    Whether the company complies with federal, state, and local laws on
          the marketing of tobacco or if it has been fined for violations;

     -    Whether the company has gone as far as peers in restricting
          advertising;

     -    Whether the company entered into the Master Settlement Agreement,
          which restricts marketing of tobacco to youth;

     -    Whether restrictions on marketing to youth extend to foreign
          countries.

Cease production of tobacco-related products or avoid selling products to
tobacco companies:

     -    The economic loss of eliminating the business versus any potential
          tobacco-related liabilities.

Investment in tobacco-related stocks or businesses:

Vote AGAINST proposals prohibiting investment in tobacco equities. Such
decisions are better left to portfolio managers.

Second-hand smoke:

     -    Whether the company complies with all local ordinances and
          regulations;

     -    The degree that voluntary restrictions beyond those mandated by law
          might hurt the company's competitiveness;

     -    The risk of any health-related liabilities.

Spin-off tobacco-related businesses:

     -    The percentage of the company's business affected;

     -    The feasibility of a spin-off;

     -    Potential future liabilities related to the company's tobacco
          business.

Stronger product warnings:

Vote AGAINST proposals seeking stronger product warnings. Such decisions are
better left to public health authorities.

DIVERSITY

BOARD DIVERSITY

Generally vote FOR reports on the company's efforts to diversify the board,
unless:

     -    The board composition is reasonably inclusive in relation to companies
          of similar size and business; or

     -    The board already reports on its nominating procedures and diversity
          initiatives.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals that would call for the adoption of specific
committee charter language regarding diversity initiatives unless the company
fails to publicly disclose existing equal opportunity or non-discrimination
policies.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking the company to increase the representation
of women and minorities on the board, taking into account:

     -    The degree of board diversity;

     -    Comparison with peer companies;

     -    Established process for improving board diversity;

     -    Existence of independent nominating committee;

     -    Use of outside search firm;

     -    History of EEO violations.

EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY AND GLASS CEILING

Generally vote FOR reports outlining the company's equal opportunity initiatives
unless all of the following apply:

     -    The company has well-documented equal opportunity programs;

     -    The company already publicly reports on its diversity initiatives
          and/or provides data on its workforce diversity; and

     -    The company has no recent EEO-related violations or litigation.

Generally vote FOR requests for reports outlining the company's progress towards
the Glass Ceiling Commission's business recommendations, unless:

     -    The composition of senior management and the board is fairly
          inclusive;

     -    The company has well-documented programs addressing diversity
          initiatives and leadership development;

     -    The company already publicly reports on its company-wide
          affirmative-action initiatives and provides data on its workforce

should be evaluated in the context of:

     -    The relevance of the issue to be linked to pay;

     -    The degree that social performance is already included in the

     -    The degree that social performance is used by peer companies in
          setting pay;

     -    Violations or complaints filed against the company relating to the
          particular social performance measure;

     -    Artificial limits sought by the proposal, such as freezing or capping

     -    Independence of the compensation committee;

standard of response to the HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria health pandemic in Africa

these markets and has failed to adopt policies and/or procedures to address

LOBBYING EXPENDITURES/INITIATIVES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals requesting information on a company's lobbying

strategy, and the impact that the policy issue may have on the company's
business operations.

POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND TRADE ASSOCIATIONS SPENDING

          activities; and

          contributions to company-sponsored political action committees (PACs)
          are strictly voluntary and not coercive.

Vote AGAINST proposals to publish in newspapers and public media the company's
political contributions as such publications could present significant cost to
the company without providing commensurate value to shareholders.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to improve the disclosure of a company's
political contributions and trade association spending considering:

     -    Recent significant controversy or litigation related to the company's
          political contributions or governmental affairs; and

     -    The public availability of a company policy on political contributions
          and trade association spending including information on the types of
          organizations supported, the business rationale for supporting these
          organizations, and the oversight and compliance procedures related to
          such expenditures of corporate assets.

Vote AGAINST proposals barring the company from making political contributions.
Businesses are affected by legislation at the federal, state, and local level
and barring contributions can put the company at a competitive disadvantage.

Vote AGAINST proposals asking for a list of company executives, directors,
consultants, legal counsels, lobbyists, or investment bankers that have prior
government service and whether such service had a bearing on the business of the
company. Such a list would be burdensome to prepare without providing any
meaningful information to shareholders.

          respect to the Internet and the free flow of information;

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

     In general, Four Corners seeks to allocate the purchase and sale of
corporate loans to clients in a fair and equitable manner to quickly and
prudently create a well-constructed, fully invested portfolio of corporate
loans. Since Four Corners' clients have varying investment restrictions, and
because of the constraining mechanics of the corporate loan market, allocation
of trades through methods such as pro-rata allocation are not feasible.
Therefore, the allocation of corporate loan purchases and sales to various
accounts is generally based on factors such as the client's investment
restrictions and objectives, including expected liquidity and/or third party
credit ratings, the client's acceptance or rejection of prospective investments,
if applicable, and the relative percentage of invested assets of a client's
portfolio, among others. Assets may be disproportionately allocated to accounts
during their initial investment (ramp up) period, notwithstanding that other
accounts may also have assets available for investment. Such disproportionate
allocation to accounts during the ramp-up process may have a detrimental effect
on other accounts. Subject to the foregoing, whenever Four Corners' clients have
available funds for investment, investments suitable and appropriate for each
will be allocated in a manner Four Corners believes to be equitable to each,
although such allocation may result in a delay in one or more client accounts
being fully invested that would not occur if an allocation to other client
accounts were not made. Moreover, it is possible that due to differing
investment objectives or for other reasons, Four Corners and its affiliates may
purchase securities or loans of an issuer for one client and at approximately
the same time recommend selling or sell the same or similar types of securities
or loans for another client. For these and other reasons, not all portfolios
will participate in the gains or losses experienced by other portfolios with
similar investment objectives.

(A)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS

     Portfolio Manager and Management Team  compensation is typically  comprised
of a base salary and a bonus. There are no pre-determined  formulas to determine
base salaries or bonus amounts.  Currently,  the registrant's Portfolio Managers
are also Principals of Four Corners,  and thus also maintain a percentage equity
ownership of the firm. From time to time, individuals on the Management Team may
also be offered equity ownership in the firm.

     The Portfolio  Managers' and Management  Team's  compensation  (e.g.,  base
salary and bonus) is determined by the  profitability  of Four Corners as a firm
without  regard to the  performance  of any one  particular  fund. The Portfolio
Managers and the  Management  Team have no direct  incentive to take undue risks
when individual fund performance is lagging.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION.

         This code of  conduct  is being  adopted  by the  investment  companies
advised by First Trust Advisors  L.P.,  from time to time,  (the  "FUNDS").  The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable  assets that are vital to the
Funds'  success.  Each officer of the Funds,  and officers and  employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters,  including each of the
Funds' senior financial  officers  ("SFOS"),  is responsible for conducting each
Fund's  business  in a manner  that  demonstrates  a  commitment  to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President),  the Controller (who is the principal accounting  officer),  and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer),  and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds,  First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust  Portfolios  have
adopted  Codes of Ethics  under Rule 17j-1 under the  Investment  Company Act of
1940 (the "RULE  17J-1  CODE").  These  Codes of Ethics are  designed to prevent
certain  conflicts  of  interest  that may arise when  officers,  employees,  or
directors of the Funds and the  foregoing  entities know about present or future
Fund  transactions  and/or have the power to influence those  transactions,  and
engage in  transactions  with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise  take  advantage of their  position and  knowledge  with
respect to those  securities.  In an effort to prevent  these  conflicts  and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1,  the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions  and conduct that create  conflicts  of interest,  and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  was  designed  to  address  corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely  disclosing financial  information.  Under Section
406 of the Act, all public  companies  (including  the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent  future  situations  (such as  occurred in  well-reported  situations
involving  such  companies  as Enron and  WorldCom)  where a company  creates an
environment  in which  employees  are afraid to  express  their  opinions  or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds  have  chosen  to adopt a senior  financial  officer  Code of
Conduct to encourage  their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust  Advisors  or First  Trust  Portfolios  to act  ethically  and to question
potentially  unethical  or illegal  practices,  and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT.

         The purposes of this Code are:

                A. To promote honest and ethical conduct,  including the ethical
         handling of actual or apparent  conflicts of interest  between personal
         and professional relationships;

                B. To promote full, fair,  accurate,  timely, and understandable
         disclosure  in reports  and  documents  that the Funds  file  with,  or
         submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the Funds make;

                C. To promote  compliance  with  applicable  governmental  laws,
         rules and regulations;

                D. To encourage the prompt internal  reporting to an appropriate
         person of violations of the Code; and

                E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE.

         The Funds'  Boards of Trustees have  designated  Joe McDermott or other
appropriate  officer  designated by the President of the respective  Funds to be
the Compliance  Coordinator for the  implementation  and  administration  of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

         The Funds have adopted  guidelines  under which its SFOs perform  their
duties.  However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or  distributor  who  participate  in the  preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                A. Act with honesty and integrity  and avoid  violations of this
         Code,  including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund
         in personal and professional relationships.

                B. Disclose to the Fund's  Compliance  Coordinator  any material
         transaction or relationship  that reasonably  could be expected to give
         rise to any  violations  of the  Code,  including  actual  or  apparent
         conflicts  of  interest  with  the  Fund.  You  should  disclose  these
         transactions  or  relationships  whether you are  involved or have only
         observed  the  transaction  or  relationship.  If it is not possible to
         disclose  the  matter  to the  Compliance  Coordinator,  it  should  be
         disclosed  to the  Fund's  Principal  Financial  Officer  or  Principal
         Executive Officer.

                C.  Provide   information  to  the  Fund's  other  officers  and
         appropriate  employees of service  providers  (adviser,  administrator,
         outside auditor,  outside counsel,  custodian,  etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                D.  Endeavor  to  ensure  full,  fair,  timely,   accurate,  and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                E. Comply with the federal  securities laws and other applicable
         laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care, competence
         and diligence,  without misrepresenting material facts or allowing your
         independent judgment to be subordinated.

                G. Respect the  confidentiality  of information  acquired in the
         course of your work except  when you have Fund  approval to disclose it
         or where  disclosure  is otherwise  legally  mandated.  You may not use
         confidential  information  acquired  in the  course  of your  work  for
         personal advantage.

                H. Share and  maintain  skills  important  and  relevant  to the
         Fund's needs.

                I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your work
         environment.

                J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources employed
         or entrusted to you.

                K.  Record or  participate  in the  recording  of entries in the
         Fund's  books  and  records  that  are  accurate  to the  best  of your
         knowledge.


<PAGE>


V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE.

         SFOs and other  parties  subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain  provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting   their  request  in  writing  to  the  Compliance   Coordinator  for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver.  All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's  shareholders  to the  extent  required  by SEC  rules.  A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code,  however,  shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION.

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual  basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

VII.     REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS.

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code MUST immediately  report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the  Audit  Committee  of the Fund  Board.  An  example  of a  possible  Code
violation  is the  preparation  and filing of  financial  disclosure  that omits
material  facts,  or that is accurate but is written in a way that  obscures its
meaning.

          B.  Because  service  providers  such  as  an  administrator,  outside
accounting  firm, and custodian  provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements,  you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal,  or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct.  You
should report these actions to the Compliance  Coordinator  even if you know, or
think,  that the  service  provider  has its own code of ethics  for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other  officers  or  employees  who  report  violations  or
suspected  violations  in good faith will not be subject to  retaliation  of any
kind.  Reported  violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.    VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE.

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this  Code,  regardless  of  whether  this Code  specifically  refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary  action,
up to and including  termination of  employment.  A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940,  state laws  relating to duties owed by Fund  directors and
officers,  and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material  misstatements  in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material  fact.  These  material
misstatements and omissions include financial  statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B.  Examples  of  criminal  violations  of the law  include  stealing,
embezzling,  misapplying  corporate  or bank  funds,  making  a  payment  for an
expressed  purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments,  whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to  influence  the judgment or actions
of political  candidates,  government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the  Funds'  activities.  The Funds must and will  report  all  suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.

     (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
