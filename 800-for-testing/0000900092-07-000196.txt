A Letter to Shareholders


Dear Shareholder

The 12 months from May 2006 to May 2007 took global equities on an
extraordinary ride. A sharp correction at the start, the first in almost
four years, gave way to strength in the latter half of 2006 and early 2007.
This rally was interrupted by another set-back at the end of February,
before markets resumed their upward march through May 31. Ultimately, the
tailwinds of a generally favorable global economic backdrop, tame
inflation, relatively low interest rates, still positive earnings growth
and attractive valuations prevailed over the headwinds of a weakening U.S.
economy, slowing housing market, escalating geopolitical concerns and high
energy prices. In fact, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index touched new record highs following the most
recent correction.

Mixed economic signals led to volatile behavior in fixed income markets as
well. However, from the beginning of 2007 through May 31, short-term bond
yields generally fell while longer-term yields increased. This resulted in
some re-steepening of the yield curve, which had been flat to inverted
throughout 2006. On a year-over-year basis, yields on 30-year Treasury
bonds fell 20 basis points (.20%) and 10-year yields fell 22 basis points,
while bond prices correspondingly rose. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve
Board (the Fed) has left the federal funds rate at 5.25% since first
pausing in August 2006. While first-quarter gross domestic product growth
of 0.6% represented the slowest rate of expansion since 2002, the Fed
reiterated its view that inflation, not a slowing economy, remains its
primary concern. Many observers interpreted the Fed's reaction to mean that
the economy has hit its low and is bound for renewed strength, therefore
reducing the likelihood of an interest rate cut in the near future.

Against this backdrop, most major market indexes posted positive returns
for the annual and semi-annual reporting periods ended May 31, 2007, with
equities exhibiting particular strength:

ANNUAL REPORTS                                                     MAY 31, 2007



A Discussion With Your Funds' Portfolio Managers


Given limited trading opportunities, Fund performance was driven largely by a
cautious balance of yield and capital appreciation potential.


Describe the recent market environment relative to municipal bonds.

Over the past 12 months, long-term bond yields generally moved lower as bond
prices, which move opposite of yields, increased. The long-term tax-exempt bond
market's solid technical position allowed it to outperform the taxable U.S.
Treasury market during the period.

Bond prices began to improve (and yields fall) in late June 2006 as economic
growth weakened. The improvement accelerated in response to the Federal Reserve
Board's (the Fed's) decision in August to keep its target interest rate on hold
at 5.25% after 17 consecutive interest rate hikes since mid-2004. The bond
price rally continued in the fall amid moderating oil prices and slower gross
domestic product (GDP) growth. By the end of November 2006, 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond yields had fallen to 4.56%.

More recently, strong U.S. equity markets, continued moderate employment growth
and mounting investor conviction that the Fed would keep interest rates steady
for the remainder of the year combined to push bond prices lower, while yields
correspondingly rose. Still, over the full 12 months, 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond yields fell 20 basis points (.20%) to 5.01%, and 10-year Treasury yields
declined 22 basis points to 4.90%.

The long-term tax-exempt bond market outperformed U.S. Treasury issues over the
12 months as investor demand outstripped a resurgent new-issue calendar. As
measured by Municipal Market Data, yields on 30-year, AAA-rated issues declined
28 basis points to 4.25%. Meanwhile, yields on intermediate-maturity bonds fell
less than those with longer maturities, as the Fed's string of interest rate
hikes in 2005 and 2006, coupled with stronger investor demand for longer-
maturity issues, resulted in a flattening of the municipal yield curve. Yields
on AAA-rated 10-year municipal issues declined 11 basis points to 3.91%.
Notably, the municipal curve remains steep relative to the Treasury curve.

Investor demand for municipal product continued to strengthen throughout the
reporting period. Statistics from the Investment Company Institute indicate
that long-term municipal bond funds received more than $10.1 billion in net new
cash flows during the first four months of 2007.

This represented a 71% increase relative to the first four months of 2006.
Weekly fund flows, as reported by AMG Data Services, also have risen. Weekly
inflows during the three months ended May 2007 averaged over $520 million, up
from a weekly average of $400 million in fourth quarter 2006 and well above the
$233 million weekly average of last June. Recent retail investor demand has
been bolstered by strong seasonal cash flows. It is estimated that investors
will receive more than $42 billion this June from coupon income and the
proceeds from bond maturities and early redemptions. Another $35 billion in
such proceeds is expected to be received in July.

As investor demand has strengthened, so has municipal bond supply. Some
$423 billion in new long-term municipal bonds was issued during the 12-month
reporting period, a nearly 12% increase compared to the same 12 months a year
ago. In the latter half of the reporting period, more than $230 billion in new
tax-exempt bonds was issued, an increase of over 35% compared to the same six
months a year ago. Over $173 billion in long-term municipal bonds has been
underwritten so far this year. This puts 2007 annual issuance more than 5%
ahead of 2005's record pace. Issuers have continued to take advantage of
historically low interest rates to refinance outstanding debt. So far this
year, there have been more than 10 underwritings exceeding $1 billion in size,
leading many analysts to adjust their estimates of 2007 annual bond issuance to
near or above $400 billion. These "mega-deals" have continued to be relatively
easily absorbed by tax-exempt market participants, especially non-traditional
and foreign buyers, both of which find the liquidity these deals afford
particularly attractive.

Looking ahead, the increase in new bond supply seen this year appears unlikely
to abate significantly. As such, investor demand will be critical in
maintaining the tax-exempt market's strong technical position. Having said
that, we expect that both traditional and non-traditional investors will
continue to be drawn to the municipal market given the relative stability of
tax-exempt yield ratios in recent months and the steepness of the municipal
yield curve compared to the taxable curve. We believe this should help to
support the market's performance in the months ahead.



ANNUAL REPORTS                                                     MAY 31, 2007



BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.


How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year?

For the 12-month period ended May 31, 2007, the Common Stock of BlackRock Muni
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 4.91% and 5.00%,
based on a year-end per share net asset value of $15.10 and a per share market
price of $14.85, respectively, and $.742 per share income dividends. Over the
same period, the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +6.14%,
based on a change in per share net asset value from $15.07 to $15.10, and
assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, exceeded the +5.25%
average return of the Lipper Intermediate Municipal Debt Funds category for
the 12-month period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest in municipal debt
issues with dollar-weighted average maturities of 5 years to 10 years.) The
Fund maintains an above-average coupon structure, which permits it to provide
a higher yield relative to the Lipper group in a stable interest rate
environment. During periods of rising interest rates, its relatively lower
interest rate sensitivity tempers price volatility, and this contributed
positively to performance during the period.

The Fund's average coupon at period-end was approximately 5.70%, compared to
a market average of roughly 4.40% (as measured by the Municipal Market Data
10-year scale). We believe this coupon structure is most effective given the
portfolio's below-average duration stance, and helps the Fund to maintain an
attractive income distribution rate.

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2007, the total investment return on the
Fund's Common Stock was +.14%, based on a change in per share net asset value
from $15.57 to $15.10, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions. For the
same period, the average return of the Lipper Intermediate Municipal Debt Funds
category was -.35%.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in
the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the
trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and
assuming reinvestment of distributions, please refer to the Financial
Highlights section of this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may
trade in the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset
value. As a result, total investment returns based on changes in the market
value of the Fund's Common Stock may vary significantly from total investment
returns based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.


What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

We did not make any notable structural changes to the portfolio over the past
12 months, as we are comfortable with the Fund's current positioning and
performance. As interest rates started to rise more significantly toward the
end of the period, we began looking slightly further out on the municipal yield
curve for investment opportunities. We believe the 15-year to 20-year segment
of the curve offers the best yield value, while allowing us to remain within
the Fund's duration parameters.

For the six months ended May 31, 2007, the average yields for the Fund's
Auction Market Preferred Stock were 3.61% for Series M7; 3.66% for Series T7;
3.74% for Series W7; 3.75% for Series TH7; 3.72% for Series F7; and 3.66% for
Series TH28. The Fed kept its target interest rate on hold at 5.25% since last
summer and, as a result, the Fund's borrowing costs stabilized and even moved
slightly lower. Although flat by historical standards, the municipal yield
curve remained positively sloped (long-term yields were higher than short-term
yields) and continued to generate an income benefit to the Common Stock
shareholder from the leveraging of Preferred Stock. As always, should the
spread between short-term and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of
leverage will decline and, as a result, reduce the yield on the Fund's Common
Stock. (For a more complete explanation of the benefits and risks of
leveraging, see page 8 of this report to shareholders.)


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We maintain the Fund's short duration relative to the Lipper category average.
This aided performance as interest rates moved higher late in the period. We
will need to be aware of changes in duration characteristics of individual
holdings as interest rates rise. We intend to maintain 80% of the Fund's net
assets in securities with durations between three years and 10 years. Because
durations change with the absolute level of interest rates, we will be mindful
to ensure that any new purchases enable the Fund to maintain its above-average
coupon structure, consistent with our investment strategy.

A Discussion With Your Funds' Portfolio Managers (concluded)


Generally speaking, the Fund has a market weighting in higher-credit-quality
issues. We intend to move the Fund to an overweight position in high-quality
securities going forward, at least until the yield advantage of lower-rated
credits increases. Currently, credit spreads are very tight and there is little
additional yield to be gained by investing in lower-quality issues. Finally, we
will concentrate our new purchases in the 15-year to 20-year maturity area of
the municipal yield curve, the steepest part of the curve, in an effort to
enhance the Fund's current yield.


BlackRock Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.


Describe conditions in the State of New York.

The State of New York ended the period rated Aa3, AA and AA- by Moody's,
Standard & Poor's and Fitch, respectively, all with stable trends. New York
ranks fifth in both debt per capita and debt as a percent of personal income,
according to Moody's. It also ranked fifth in per capita income in 2006
(preliminary), according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. New York's April
2007 unemployment rate was 4.1%, which was below the national rate of 4.5%.

The state's fiscal year 2006 operations resulted in a $2 billion surplus and
an ending $900 million "rainy day" reserve. The November 2006 financial plan
update forecasts a $1.1 billion general fund surplus in fiscal year 2007, due
to higher-than-expected receipts and spending reductions. On April 1, 2007,
New York lawmakers passed a $120.9 billion budget for fiscal year 2008 that
increases spending by 8.7%, the largest annual increase since 2000. Despite
$1 billion in Medicaid cuts, property-tax rebates and increased school aid
pushed spending higher. Key credit issues remain cost pressures from Medicaid,
pensions and school aid, as well as the sustainability of growing personal
income tax receipts.


How did the Fund perform during the fiscal year?

For the 12-month period ended May 31, 2007, the Common Stock of BlackRock Muni
New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 4.30%
and 4.60%, based on a year-end per share net asset value of $14.91 and a per
share market price of $13.93, respectively, and $.641 per share income
dividends. Over the same period, the total investment return on the Fund's
Common Stock was +6.57%, based on a change in per share net asset value from
$14.66 to $14.91, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions.

The Fund's total return, based on net asset value, exceeded the +5.25%
average return of the Lipper Intermediate Municipal Debt Funds category for
the 12-month period. (Funds in this Lipper category invest in municipal debt
issues with dollar-weighted average maturities of 5 years to 10 years.) When
evaluating relative performance, it is important to note that while the Lipper
category accounts for the Fund's intermediate duration profile, there will be
some variance in total returns and yields, as the category includes national
funds, in addition to funds focused on single states other than New York.

Total return outperformance resulted from a combination of the Fund's slightly
longer duration relative to the Lipper group and our concentrated effort to
enhance distributable income for shareholders. Additionally, the Fund benefited
from select purchases of higher-yielding, lower-rated investment grade issues
as lower-quality credits continued to top the high-grade market throughout the
reporting period, in addition to generating incremental yield for the
portfolio.

Detracting from both the Fund's total return performance and income was a below-
average distribution rate. In part, this is attributable to the low-interest-
rate environment that existed when the Fund was established. While we are
continuously looking for opportunities to book bonds at higher yields, a soft
market has presented few prospects, leaving the Fund with more lower-yielding
bonds than some of its more-seasoned peers.

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2007, the total investment return on the
Fund's Common Stock was -.18%, based on a change in per share net asset value
from $15.28 to $14.91, and assuming reinvestment of all distributions. For the
same period, the average return of the Lipper Intermediate Municipal Debt Funds
category was -.35%.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in
the per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the
trading price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and
assuming reinvestment of distributions, please refer to the Financial
Highlights section of this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may
trade in the secondary market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset
value. As a result, total investment returns based on changes in the market
value of the Fund's Common Stock may vary significantly from total investment
returns based on changes in the Fund's net asset value.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

Trading activity was limited throughout the reporting period. We focused
largely on improving the Fund's distribution rate and, in many cases, opted to
retain the Fund's older bonds, which have higher yields than those currently
available in the new-issue market.

New issuance of New York municipal bonds was down nearly 16% versus a year ago,
despite a spate of refunding activity at the end of 2006. Broadly speaking, few
issues met our desired investment characteristics as new supply in the
municipal market has been dominated by debt refinancing (wherein issuers retire
existing bonds by using proceeds from new issuance) and other non-traditional
structured products.

Although the macro environment prohibited any major restructuring, we did begin
to trim the portfolio's short-term holdings, specifically shorter-dated
prerefunded bonds and high-coupon, short-call bonds (generally those having a
call date within three years or less). These bonds are priced with a premium
and, as the call date approaches, their value depreciates at an accelerating
rate and they tend to underperform the broader market. While this move
temporarily hurts distributable income, we believe it is a worthwhile trade-off
to protect the future total return potential of the Fund.

We reinvested the proceeds primarily on the long end of the municipal yield
curve, where we found attractive opportunities to trade the portfolio and to
generate higher levels of income for the Fund. Key purchases during the year
included: insured Yankees and Mets (Queens Stadium) bonds, high-quality
holdings that we believe have long-term capital appreciation potential;
housing bonds, which offer the benefits of above-market yield and lower-than-
average volatility; education bonds, mainly those of colleges and universities,
where financial profiles have been steadily improving; and Puerto Rico bonds,
which - despite their recent underperformance - offer incremental yield and
enhance portfolio liquidity. In addition, we modestly reduced our insured
holdings in favor of higher-yielding, lower-quality credits (primarily issues
rated BBB and BBB+).

For the six months ended May 31, 2007, the average yield for the Fund's Auction
Market Preferred Stock was 3.48%. There was no material change in the Fund's
borrowing costs over the course of the period, as the Fed kept the federal
funds target rate steady at 5.25% since first pausing last August. Although
flat by historical standards, the tax-exempt yield curve maintained a positive
slope throughout the period (particularly compared to the U.S. Treasury yield
curve), allowing us to borrow at a lower rate than where we invest. This
continued to generate an income benefit to the holders of Common Stock from the
leveraging of Preferred Stock. As always, should the spread between short-term
and long-term interest rates narrow, the benefits of leverage will decline and,
accordingly, the yield on the Fund's Common Stock will be reduced. (For a more
complete explanation of the benefits and risks of leveraging, see page 8 of
this report to shareholders.)


How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We maintained a fully invested portfolio throughout the period and ended the
year with a slightly longer duration than that of our comparable Lipper group.
Given a quiet Fed and few new-issue prospects, we are focusing on identifying
compelling relative value trading opportunities, while continuing our efforts
to add yield to the portfolio. We are encouraged by the recent back-up (that
is, increase) in interest rates and the pick-up in new-issue supply, and will
continue to evaluate prospects for portfolio diversification and income
accrual. We also will seek additional opportunities to sell shorter-dated bonds
and reinvest those proceeds in attractive, longer-dated bonds.

Looking ahead, we believe the municipal bond market is well positioned for
outperformance given a high level of scheduled municipal bond payouts in the
coming months. Approximately $70 billion in municipal coupon and principal
payments are due to investors in June and July - money that tends to be
reinvested in the municipal market. Moreover, the recent back-up in interest
rates has attracted the interest of retail buyers (traditional and majority
purchasers of municipal bonds), which we believe should translate into
sustained demand for municipal securities.

ANNUAL REPORTS                                                     MAY 31, 2007



The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


The Funds utilize leveraging to seek to enhance the yields and net asset values
of their Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in all
interest rate environments. To leverage, each Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these
investments, net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock
shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio
holdings is reflected in the per share net asset value of each Fund's Common
Stock. However, in order to benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve
must be positively sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must be lower
than long-term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally
declining interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If either of
these conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will begin to outweigh
the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50 million,
creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in long-term
municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are approximately 3%
and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield curve has a
strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50 million of
Preferred Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At the same time,
the fund's total portfolio of $150 million earns the income based on long-term
interest rates.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term investments,
and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries of the
incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise, narrowing the
differential between short-term and long-term interest rates, the incremental
yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated completely. At
the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock (that is, its price
as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may, as a result, decline.
Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common Stock's net asset
value will reflect the full decline in the price of the portfolio's
investments, since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does not fluctuate.
In addition to the decline in net asset value, the market value of the fund's
Common Stock may also decline.

As of May 31, 2007, BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and
BlackRock Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had leverage amounts,
due to Auction Market Preferred Stock, of 35.79% and 33.08% of total net
assets, respectively, before the deduction of Preferred Stock.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Funds may invest in certain
securities whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a
floating interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse
floaters will decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase
when short-term interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may be
characterized as derivative securities and may subject the Funds to the risks
of reduced or eliminated interest payments and losses of invested principal. In
addition, inverse floaters have the effect of providing investment leverage
and, as a result, the market value of such securities will generally be more
volatile than that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To the extent the
Funds invest in inverse floaters, the market value of each Fund's portfolio and
the net asset value of each Fund's shares may also be more volatile than if the
Funds did not invest in such securities. (See Note 1(c) to Financial Statements
for details of municipal bonds held in trust.)

ANNUAL REPORTS                                                     MAY 31, 2007



Notes to Financial Statements


1. Significant Accounting Policies:
On September 29, 2006, Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and Muni New York
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. were renamed BlackRock Muni Intermediate
Duration Fund, Inc. and BlackRock Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund,
Inc. (the "Funds" or individually as the "Fund"), respectively. The Funds are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as non-
diversified, closed-end management investment companies. The Funds' financial
statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, which may require the use of management accruals and estimates.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Funds determine and make
available for publication the net asset values of their Common Stock on a daily
basis. Each Fund's Common Stock shares are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the symbol MUI for BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund,
Inc. and MNE for BlackRock Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.

(a) Valuation of investments--Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the over-
the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price in
the OTC markets or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Funds under the general
direction of the respective Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures
are reviewed periodically by the respective Board of Directors of the Funds.
Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges,
are valued at their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options
written or purchased are valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-
traded options. Options traded in the OTC market are valued at the last asked
price (options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap
agreements are valued by quoted fair valuations received daily by the Funds'
pricing service. Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at
their net asset value each business day. Securities and other assets for which
market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the respective Board of
Directors of the Funds.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--Each Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the
securities markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the
contract or if the counterparty does not perform under the contract.

* Financial futures contracts--Each Fund may purchase or sell financial futures
contracts and options on such financial futures contracts. Financial futures
contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future
date and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
deposits, and maintains as collateral, such initial margin as required by the
exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the contract, the
Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the
daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as unrealized gains or losses.
When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was opened and
the value at the time it was closed.

* Options--Each Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the Fund
writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund is
reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability
is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the
option written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from)
the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a closing
transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the extent of
the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the cost of the
closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received). Written and
purchased options are non-income producing investments.

* Forward interest rate swaps--Each Fund may enter into forward interest rate
swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty agree to
make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract amount, commencing
on a specified future effective date, unless terminated earlier. When the
agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss in an amount
equal to the value of the agreement.



ANNUAL REPORTS                                                     MAY 31, 2007



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


* Swaps--Each Fund may enter into swap agreements which are OTC contracts in
which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments on a
specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set period of
time or may be triggered by a predetermined credit event. The net periodic
payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate; the change in
market value of a specific security, basket of securities, or index; or the
return generated by a security. These periodic payments received or made by the
Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of Operations as realized gains
or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are also realized upon termination of
the swap agreements. Swaps are marked-to-market daily and changes in value are
recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in
the returns of the underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to
perform under the contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with
respect to the swap agreements.

(c) Municipal bonds held in trust--BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund,
Inc. invests in leveraged residual certificates ("TOB Residuals") issued by
tender option bond trusts ("TOBs"). A TOB is established by a third party
sponsor forming a special purpose entity, into which a Fund, or an agent on
behalf of the Fund, transfers municipal securities. A TOB typically issues two
classes of beneficial interests: short-term floating rate certificates, which
are sold to third party investors, and residual certificates, which are
generally issued to the Fund which made the transfer or to affiliates of the
Fund. The Fund's transfers of the municipal securities to a TOB do not qualify
for sale treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140
"Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
of Liabilities," therefore the municipal securities deposited into a TOB are
presented in the Fund's schedule of investments and the proceeds from the
transactions are reported as liability for trust certificates. Similarly,
proceeds from residual certificates issued to affiliates, if any, from the
transaction are included in the liability for trust certificates. Interest
income from the underlying security is recorded by the Fund on an accrual
basis. Interest expense incurred on the secured borrowing and other expenses
related to remarketing, administration and trustee services to a TOB are
reported as expenses of a Fund. The floating rate certificates have interest
rates that generally reset weekly and their holders have the option to tender
certificates to the TOB for redemption at par at each reset date. The residual
interests held by the Fund include the right of the Fund (1) to cause the
holders of a proportional share of floating rate certificates to tender their
certificates at par, and (2) to transfer a corresponding share of the municipal
securities from the TOB to the Fund. At May 31, 2007, in reference to BlackRock
Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc., the aggregate value of the underlying
municipal securities transferred to TOBs was $63,269,180, the related liability
for trust certificates was $30,035,000 and the range of interest rates was
3.26% to 4.02%. BlackRock Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. did
not invest in these types of securities for the year ended May 31, 2007.

Financial transactions executed through TOBs generally will underperform the
market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment,
but tend to outperform the market for fixed rate bonds when interest rates
decline or remain relatively stable. Should short-term interest rates rise, a
Fund's investments in TOB Residuals likely will adversely affect a Fund's
investment income--net and distributions to shareholders. Fluctuations in the
market value of municipal securities deposited into the TOB may adversely
affect the Fund's net asset value per share.

While the Funds' investment policies and restrictions expressly permit
investments in inverse floating rate securities such as TOB Residuals, they
generally do not allow the Funds to borrow money for purposes of making
investments. The Fund's management believes that the Fund's restrictions on
borrowings do not apply to the secured borrowings deemed to have occurred for
accounting purposes.

(d) Income taxes--It is each Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(e) Security transactions and investment income--Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the trans-actions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds amortize all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.



ANNUAL REPORTS                                                     MAY 31, 2007



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


(f) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(g) Offering costs--Direct expenses relating to the public offering of
BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.'s Preferred Stock were charged
to capital at the time of issuance of the shares.

(h) Recent accounting pronouncements--In July 2006, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board released FASB Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes". FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax
positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial
statements. FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course
of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold
would be booked as a tax expense in the current year and recognized as: a
liability for unrecognized tax benefits; a reduction of an income tax refund
receivable; a reduction of deferred tax asset; an increase in deferred tax
liability; or a combination thereof. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for the
last net asset value calculation in the first required financial statement
reporting period for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The impact
on each Fund's financial statements, if any, is currently being assessed.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair
Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of FAS
157 and its impact on each Fund's financial statements, if any, has not been
determined.

In addition, in February 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities" ("FAS 159"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal
year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also
elects to apply the provisions of FAS 157. FAS 159 permits entities to choose
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities. At this time, management is evaluating
the implications of FAS 159 and its impact on each Fund's financial statements,
if any, has not been determined.

(i) Reclassifications--BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.--U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles require that certain components of net
assets be adjusted to reflect permanent differences between financial and tax
reporting. Accordingly, during the current year, $162 has been reclassified
between paid-in capital in excess of par and accumulated net realized capital
losses and $108 has been reclassified between undistributed net investment
income and accumulated net realized capital losses as a result of permanent
differences attributable to distributions paid in excess of taxable income.
These reclassifications have no effect on net assets or net asset value per
share.


2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:
On September 29, 2006, BlackRock, Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill
Lynch") combined Merrill Lynch's investment management business, Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers L.P. ("MLIM") and its affiliates, including Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"), with BlackRock, Inc. to create a new independent
company. Merrill Lynch has a 49.8% economic interest and a 45% voting interest
in the combined company and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC"), has
approximately a 34% economic and voting interest. The new company operates
under the BlackRock name and is governed by a board of directors with a
majority of independent members.

On August 15, 2006, shareholders of each Fund approved a new Investment
Advisory Agreement with BlackRock Advisors, Inc. (the "Manager"), an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock Advisors, Inc. was
reorganized into a limited liability company and renamed BlackRock Advisors,
LLC. The new Investment Advisory Agreement between each Fund and the Manager
became effective on September 29, 2006. Prior to September 29, 2006, FAM was
each Fund's manager. The general partner of FAM is an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of Merrill Lynch, which is the limited partner.



ANNUAL REPORTS                                                     MAY 31, 2007



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)



The Manager is responsible for the management of each Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of the Funds. For such services, each
Fund pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of .55% of the Fund's average daily
net assets, including proceeds from the issuance of Preferred Stock. The
Manager (and formerly FAM) has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its
fee during the first seven years of each Fund's operations ending July 31,
2010, as follows:

Year 8 and thereafter                                              .00%


The Manager has not agreed to waive any portion of its fee beyond July 31,
2010.

   contracts and the differences between book and tax treatment of

6. Restatement Information:
Subsequent to the initial issuance of its May 31, 2006 financial statements,
BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. determined that the criteria
for sale accounting in FAS 140 had not been met for certain transfers of
municipal bonds, and that these transfers should have been accounted for as
secured borrowings rather than as sales. As a result, certain financial
highlights for the year ended May 31, 2005 have been restated to give effect to
recording the transfers of the municipal bonds as secured borrowings, including
recording interest on the bonds as interest income and interest on the secured
borrowings as interest expense.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
of BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of net assets, including the
schedule of investments, of BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.
(formerly Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.) (the "Fund") as of May 31,
2007, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended and the
statements of changes in net assets and the financial highlights for each of
the two years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits. The financial highlights for the year
ended May 31, 2005 (before the restatement described in Note 6) were audited by
other auditors whose report, dated July 13, 2005, expressed a qualified opinion
on the financial highlights because of the errors described in Note 6. The
financial highlights for the period August 1, 2003 (commencement of operations)
to May 31, 2004 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated July 13,
2005, ex-pressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of May 31, 2007, by correspondence
with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received from brokers,
we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audit provides a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights of BlackRock
Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. referred to above, present fairly, in all
material respects, its financial position as of May 31, 2007, the results of
its operations for the year then ended and the changes in its net assets and
its financial highlights for each of the two years in the period then ended, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America.

We also have audited the adjustments, applied by management, to restate certain
financial highlights for the year ended May 31, 2005 to correct the errors
described in Note 6. These adjustments are the responsibility of the Fund's
management. The audit procedures that we performed with respect to the
adjustments included such tests as we considered necessary in the circumstances
and were designed to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the adjustments
are appropriate and have been properly applied, in all material respects, to
the restated financial highlights for the year ended May 31, 2005. We did not
perform any audit procedures designed to assess whether any additional
adjustments to such financial highlights might be necessary in order for such
financial highlights to be presented in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. In our opinion, the adjustments to the financial
highlights for the year ended May 31, 2005 described in Note 6 are appropriate
and have been properly applied, in all material respects. However, we were not
engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to such financial highlights
other than with respect to the adjustments described in Note 6 and,
accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on
such financial highlights.

Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan


How the Plan Works--The Funds offer a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan")
under which income and capital gains dividends paid by each Fund are
automatically reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock of each Fund. The
Plan is administered on behalf of the shareholders by Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. (the "Plan Agent"). Under the Plan, whenever the Funds declare a
dividend, participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares of
Common Stock of each Fund. The Plan Agent will acquire the shares for the
participant's account either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
authorized shares of each Fund ("newly issued shares") or (ii) by purchase of
outstanding shares of Common Stock on the open market on the New York Stock
Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the dividend payment date, each Fund's net asset
value per share is equal to or less than the market price per share plus
estimated brokerage commissions (a condition often referred to as a "market
premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
shares. If the Funds' net asset value per share is greater than the market
price per share (a condition often referred to as a "market discount"), the
Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount by purchasing on the open market
additional shares. If the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend
amount in open market purchases, or if the market discount shifts to a market
premium during the purchase period, the Plan Agent will invest any uninvested
portion in newly issued shares. The shares acquired are credited to each
shareholder's account. The amount credited is determined by dividing the dollar
amount of the dividend by either (i) when the shares are newly issued, the net
asset value per share on the date the shares are issued or (ii) when shares are
purchased in the open market, the average purchase price per share.

Participation in the Plan--Participation in the Plan is automatic, that is, a
shareholder is automatically enrolled in the Plan when he or she purchases
shares of Common Stock of the Funds unless the shareholder specifically elects
not to participate in the Plan. Shareholders who elect not to participate will
receive all dividend distributions in cash. Shareholders who do not wish to
participate in the Plan must advise the Plan Agent in writing (at the address
set forth below) that they elect not to participate in the Plan. Participation
in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any
time without penalty by writing to the Plan Agent.

Benefits of the Plan--The Plan provides an easy, convenient way for
shareholders to make additional, regular investments in the Funds. The Plan
promotes a long-term strategy of investing at a lower cost. All shares acquired
pursuant to the Plan receive voting rights. In addition, if the market price
plus commissions of each Fund's shares is above the net asset value,
participants in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund for less than they
could otherwise purchase them and with a cash value greater than the value of
any cash distribution they would have received. However, there may not be
enough shares available in the market to make distributions in shares at prices
below the net asset value. Also, since each Fund does not redeem shares, the
price on resale may be more or less than the net asset value.

Plan Fees--There are no enrollment fees or brokerage fees for participating in
the Plan. The Plan Agent's service fees for handling the reinvestment of
distributions are paid for by the Fund. However, brokerage commissions may be
incurred when the Fund purchases shares on the open market and shareholders
will pay a pro rata share of any such commissions.

Tax Implications--The automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will not relieve participants of any federal, state or local income tax that
may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such dividends. Therefore,
income and capital gains may still be realized even though shareholders do not
receive cash.

Contact Information--All correspondence concerning the Plan, including any
questions about the Plan, should be directed to the Plan Agent at
Computershare Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI 02940-3010,
Telephone: 800-426-5523.

Change in Fund's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


On August 28, 2006, Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") resigned as the Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm of BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund,
Inc. and BlackRock Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. (the "Funds")
because it was determined that E&Y is not independent of BlackRock, Inc. and
the Funds.

E&Y's reports on the financial statements of the Funds for the prior two fiscal
years did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and except
for the restatement information contained in Note 6 to the Financial
Statements, were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles.

In connection with its audits for the two most recent fiscal years and through
August 28, 2006 (1) there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of
accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure, whereby such disagreements, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused them to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreements in connection with their report on the financial
statements for such years; and (2) there have been no reportable events (as
defined in item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).

The Audit Committee of the Funds' Board of Directors approved the engagement of
Deloitte & Touche llp as the Funds' Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2007.

Swap Agreements


The Funds may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts
in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in
market value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return for
periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in
market value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements
may be used to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the
party with whom each Fund has entered into the swap will default on its
obligation to pay the Funds and the risk that the Funds will not be able to
meet their obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.



Availability of Quarterly Schedule of Investments


The Funds file their complete schedules of portfolio holdings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") for the first and third quarters
of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. The Funds' Forms N-Q are available on the
SEC's Web site at http://www.sec.gov. The Funds' Forms N-Q may also be
reviewed and copied at the SEC's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC.

           Fred G. Weiss.

Item 4 -   Principal Accountant Fees and Services

           Note: The Fund changed auditors effective August, 28, 2006.  Prior
           to that date, Ernst & Young LLP provided services as the Fund's
           independent registered public accountant.

           (a) Audit Fees -         Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2007 - $32,500
                                    Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2006 - $54,250

           (c) Tax Fees -           Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2007 - $6,100
                                    Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2006 - $6,000

           The nature of the services include tax compliance, tax advice and

           (e)(1) The registrant's audit committee (the "Committee") has
           adopted policies and procedures with regard to the pre-approval of
           services.  Audit, audit-related and tax compliance services provided
           to the registrant on an annual basis require specific pre-approval
           by the Committee.  The Committee also must approve other non-audit
           services provided to the registrant and those non-audit services
           provided to the registrant's affiliated service providers that
           relate directly to the operations and the financial reporting of the
           registrant.  Certain of these non-audit services that the Committee
           believes are a) consistent with the SEC's auditor independence rules
           and b) routine and recurring services that will not impair the
           independence of the independent accountants may be approved by the
           Committee without consideration on a specific case-by-case basis
           ("general pre-approval").  However, such services will only be
           deemed pre-approved provided that any individual project does not
           exceed $5,000 attributable to the registrant or $50,000 for all of
           the registrants the Committee oversees.  Any proposed services
           exceeding the pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-
           approval by the Committee, as will any other services not subject to
           general pre-approval (e.g., unanticipated but permissible services).
           The Committee is informed of each service approved subject to
           general pre-approval at the next regularly scheduled in-person board
           meeting.

               Fiscal Year Ended May 31, 2006 - $3,124,717

           (h) The registrant's audit committee has considered and determined
           that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
           registrant's investment adviser and any entity controlling,
           controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
           that provides ongoing services to the registrant that were not pre-
           approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation
           S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
           independence.

Item 7 -   Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
           Management Investment Companies -
           Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures Applicable to the Fund
           -----------------------------------------------------------

           Each Fund's Board of Directors has delegated to the Manager
           authority to vote all proxies relating to the Fund's portfolio
           securities. The Manager has adopted policies and procedures (the
           "Proxy Voting Procedures") with respect to the voting of proxies
           related to the portfolio securities held in the account of one or
           more of its clients, including a Fund. Pursuant to these Proxy
           Voting Procedures, the Manager's primary objective when voting
           proxies is to make proxy voting decisions solely in the best
           interests of each Fund and its shareholders, and to act in a manner
           that the Manager believes is most likely to enhance the economic
           value of the securities held by the Fund. The Proxy Voting
           Procedures are designed to ensure that the Manager considers the
           interests of its clients, including each Fund, and not the interests
           of the Manager, when voting proxies and that real (or perceived)
           material conflicts that may arise between the Manager's interest and
           those of the Manager's clients are properly addressed and resolved.

           In order to implement the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Manager has
           formed a Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee"). The Committee,
           which is a subcommittee of the Manager's Equity Investment Policy
           Oversight Committee ("EIPOC"), is comprised of a senior member of
           the Manager's equity management group who is also a member of EIPOC,
           one or more other senior investment professionals appointed by
           EIPOC, portfolio managers and investment analysts appointed by EIPOC
           and any other personnel EIPOC deems appropriate. The Committee will
           also include two non-voting representatives from the Manager's Legal
           Department appointed by the Manager's General Counsel. The
           Committee's membership shall be limited to full-time employees of
           the Manager. No person with any investment banking, trading, retail
           brokerage or research responsibilities for the Manager's affiliates
           may serve as a member of the Committee or participate in its
           decision making (except to the extent such person is asked by the
           Committee to present information to the Committee on the same basis
           as other interested knowledgeable parties not affiliated with the
           Manager might be asked to do so). The Committee determines how to
           vote the proxies of all clients, including a Fund, that have
           delegated proxy voting authority to the Manager and seeks to ensure
           that all votes are consistent with the best interests of those
           clients and are free from unwarranted and inappropriate influences.
           The Committee establishes general proxy voting policies for the
           Manager and is responsible for determining how those policies are
           applied to specific proxy votes, in light of each issuer's unique
           structure, management, strategic options and, in certain
           circumstances, probable economic and other anticipated consequences
           of alternate actions. In so doing, the Committee may determine to
           vote a particular proxy in a manner contrary to its generally stated
           policies. In addition, the Committee will be responsible for
           ensuring that all reporting and recordkeeping requirements related
           to proxy voting are fulfilled.

           The Committee may determine that the subject matter of a recurring
           proxy issue is not suitable for general voting policies and requires
           a case-by-case determination. In such cases, the Committee may elect
           not to adopt a specific voting policy applicable to that issue. The
           Manager believes that certain proxy voting issues require investment
           analysis - such as approval of mergers and other significant
           corporate transactions - akin to investment decisions, and are,
           therefore, not suitable for general guidelines. The Committee may
           elect to adopt a common position for the Manager on certain proxy
           votes that are akin to investment decisions, or determine to permit
           the portfolio manager to make individual decisions on how best to
           maximize economic value for a Fund (similar to normal buy/sell
           investment decisions made by such portfolio managers). While it is
           expected that the Manager will generally seek to vote proxies over
           which the Manager exercises voting authority in a uniform manner for
           all the Manager's clients, the Committee, in conjunction with a
           Fund's portfolio manager, may determine that the Fund's specific
           circumstances require that its proxies be voted differently.

           To assist the Manager in voting proxies, the Committee has retained
           Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"). ISS is an independent
           adviser that specializes in providing a variety of fiduciary-level
           proxy-related services to institutional investment managers, plan
           sponsors, custodians, consultants, and other institutional
           investors. The services provided to the Manager by ISS include in-
           depth research, voting recommendations (although the Manager is not
           obligated to follow such recommendations), vote execution, and
           recordkeeping. ISS will also assist the Fund in fulfilling its
           reporting and recordkeeping obligations under the Investment Company
           Act.

           The Manager's Proxy Voting Procedures also address special
           circumstances that can arise in connection with proxy voting. For
           instance, under the Proxy Voting Procedures, the Manager generally
           will not seek to vote proxies related to portfolio securities that
           are on loan, although it may do so under certain circumstances. In
           addition, the Manager will vote proxies related to securities of
           foreign issuers only on a best efforts basis and may elect not to
           vote at all in certain countries where the Committee determines that
           the costs associated with voting generally outweigh the benefits.
           The Committee may at any time override these general policies if it
           determines that such action is in the best interests of a Fund.

           From time to time, the Manager may be required to vote proxies in
           respect of an issuer where an affiliate of the Manager (each, an
           "Affiliate"), or a money management or other client of the Manager,
           including investment companies for which the Manager provides
           investment advisory, administrative and/or other services (each, a
           "Client"), is involved. The Proxy Voting Procedures and the
           Manager's adherence to those procedures are designed to address such
           conflicts of interest. The Committee intends to strictly adhere to
           the Proxy Voting Procedures in all proxy matters, including matters
           involving Affiliates and Clients. If, however, an issue representing
           a non-routine matter that is material to an Affiliate or a widely
           known Client is involved such that the Committee does not reasonably
           believe it is able to follow its guidelines (or if the particular
           proxy matter is not addressed by the guidelines) and vote
           impartially, the Committee may, in its discretion for the purposes
           of ensuring that an independent determination is reached, retain an
           independent fiduciary to advise the Committee on how to vote or to
           cast votes on behalf of the Manager's clients.

           In the event that the Committee determines not to retain an
           independent fiduciary, or it does not follow the advice of such an
           independent fiduciary, the Committee may pass the voting power to a
           subcommittee, appointed by EIPOC (with advice from the Secretary of
           the Committee), consisting solely of Committee members selected by
           EIPOC. EIPOC shall appoint to the subcommittee, where appropriate,
           only persons whose job responsibilities do not include contact with
           the Client and whose job evaluations would not be affected by the
           Manager's relationship with the Client (or failure to retain such
           relationship). The subcommittee shall determine whether and how to
           vote all proxies on behalf of the Manager's clients or, if the proxy
           matter is, in their judgment, akin to an investment decision, to
           defer to the applicable portfolio managers, provided that, if the
           subcommittee determines to alter the Manager's normal voting
           guidelines or, on matters where the Manager's policy is case-by-
           case, does not follow the voting recommendation of any proxy voting
           service or other independent fiduciary that may be retained to
           provide research or advice to the Manager on that matter, no proxies
           relating to the Client may be voted unless the Secretary, or in the
           Secretary's absence, the Assistant Secretary of the Committee
           concurs that the subcommittee's determination is consistent with the
           Manager's fiduciary duties.

           In addition to the general principles outlined above, the Manager
           has adopted voting guidelines with respect to certain recurring
           proxy issues that are not expected to involve unusual circumstances.
           These policies are guidelines only, and the Manager may elect to
           vote differently from the recommendation set forth in a voting
           guideline if the Committee determines that it is in a Fund's best
           interest to do so. In addition, the guidelines may be reviewed at
           any time upon the request of a Committee member and may be amended
           or deleted upon the vote of a majority of Committee members present
           at a Committee meeting at which there is a quorum.

           The Manager has adopted specific voting guidelines with respect to
           the following proxy issues:

           * Proposals related to the composition of the board of directors of
           issuers other than investment companies. As a general matter, the
           Committee believes that a company's board of directors (rather than
           shareholders) is most likely to have access to important, nonpublic
           information regarding a company's business and prospects, and is,
           therefore, best-positioned to set corporate policy and oversee
           management. The Committee, therefore, believes that the foundation
           of good corporate governance is the election of qualified,
           independent corporate directors who are likely to diligently
           represent the interests of shareholders and oversee management of
           the corporation in a manner that will seek to maximize shareholder
           value over time. In individual cases, the Committee may look at a
           nominee's number of other directorships, history of representing
           shareholder interests as a director of other companies or other
           factors, to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

           * Proposals related to the selection of an issuer's independent
           auditors. As a general matter, the Committee believes that corporate
           auditors have a responsibility to represent the interests of
           shareholders and provide an independent view on the propriety of
           financial reporting decisions of corporate management. While the
           Committee will generally defer to a corporation's choice of auditor,
           in individual cases, the Committee may look at an auditors' history
           of representing shareholder interests as auditor of other companies,
           to the extent the Committee deems relevant.

           * Proposals related to management compensation and employee
           benefits. As a general matter, the Committee favors disclosure of an
           issuer's compensation and benefit policies and opposes excessive
           compensation, but believes that compensation matters are normally
           best determined by an issuer's board of directors, rather than
           shareholders. Proposals to "micro-manage" an issuer's compensation
           practices or to set arbitrary restrictions on compensation or
           benefits will, therefore, generally not be supported.

           * Proposals related to requests, principally from management, for
           approval of amendments that would alter an issuer's capital
           structure. As a general matter, the Committee will support requests
           that enhance the rights of common shareholders and oppose requests
           that appear to be unreasonably dilutive.

           * Proposals related to requests for approval of amendments to an
           issuer's charter or by-laws. As a general matter, the Committee
           opposes poison pill provisions.

           * Routine proposals related to requests regarding the formalities of
           corporate meetings.

           * Proposals related to proxy issues associated solely with holdings
           of investment company shares. As with other types of companies, the
           Committee believes that a fund's board of directors (rather than its
           shareholders) is best positioned to set fund policy and oversee
           management. However, the Committee opposes granting boards of
           directors authority over certain matters, such as changes to a
           fund's investment objective, which the Investment Company Act
           envisions will be approved directly by shareholders.

           * Proposals related to limiting corporate conduct in some manner
           that relates to the shareholder's environmental or social concerns.
           The Committee generally believes that annual shareholder meetings
           are inappropriate forums for discussion of larger social issues, and
           opposes shareholder resolutions "micromanaging" corporate conduct or
           requesting release of information that would not help a shareholder
           evaluate an investment in the corporation as an economic matter.
           While the Committee is generally supportive of proposals to require
           corporate disclosure of matters that seem relevant and material to
           the economic interests of shareholders, the Committee is generally
           not supportive of proposals to require disclosure of corporate
           matters for other purposes.

           (iv)   Potential Material Conflicts of Interest
</TABLE>


           BlackRock has built a professional working environment, firm-wide
           compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to
           protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over
           another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address
           the allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio
           transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential
           conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client
           accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock
           furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous
           clients in addition to the Fund, and BlackRock may, consistent with
           applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or
           accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have
           performance or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio
           managers have a personal interest in the receipt of such fees),
           which may be the same as or different from those made to the Fund.
           In addition, BlackRock, its affiliates and any officer, director,
           stockholder or employee may or may not have an interest in the
           securities whose purchase and sale BlackRock recommends to the Fund.
           BlackRock, or any of its affiliates, or any officer, director,
           stockholder, employee or any member of their families may take
           different actions than those recommended to the Fund by BlackRock
           with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock may refrain
           from rendering any advice or services concerning securities of
           companies of which any of BlackRock's (or its affiliates') officers,
           directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to
           which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or the officers, directors
           and employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest
           or possesses material non-public information. Each portfolio manager
           also may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be
           opposed to the strategy utilized for the Fund. In this connection,
           it should be noted that certain portfolio managers currently manage
           certain accounts that are subject to performance fees. In addition,
           certain portfolio managers assist in managing certain hedge funds
           and may be entitled to receive a portion of any incentive fees
           earned on such funds and a portion of such incentive fees may be
           voluntarily or involuntarily deferred. Additional portfolio managers
           may in the future manage other such accounts or funds and may be
           entitled to receive incentive fees.

           As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and
           must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells
           securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated
           in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts
           to allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client
           accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this
           end, BlackRock has adopted a policy that is intended to ensure that
           investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among
           client accounts over time. This policy also seeks to achieve
           reasonable efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock
           with sufficient flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that
           is consistent with the particular investment discipline and client
           base.

           (a)(3) As of May 31, 2007:

               Portfolio Manager Compensation

           The elements of total compensation for portfolio managers on
           BlackRock's municipal team include a fixed base salary, annual
           performance-based cash and stock compensation (cash and stock bonus)
           and other benefits. BlackRock has balanced these components of pay
           to provide these portfolio managers with a powerful incentive to
           achieve consistently superior investment performance. By design,
           compensation levels for these portfolio managers fluctuate--both up
           and down--with the relative investment performance of the portfolios
           that they manage.

                Base compensation.  Like that of many asset management firms,
           base salaries represent a relatively small portion of a portfolio
           manager's total compensation. This approach serves to enhance the
           motivational value of the performance-based (and therefore variable)
           compensation elements of the compensation program.

           Performance-Based Compensation.  BlackRock believes that the best
           interests of investors are served by recruiting and retaining
           exceptional asset management talent and managing their compensation
           within a consistent and disciplined framework that emphasizes pay
           for performance in the context of an intensely competitive market
           for talent. To that end, BlackRock and its affiliates portfolio
           manager incentive compensation is based on a formulaic compensation
           program. BlackRock's formulaic portfolio manager compensation
           program includes: investment performance relative to a subset of
           closed-end, intermediate municipal debt funds over 1-, 3- and 5-year
           performance periods and a measure of operational efficiency.
           Portfolio managers are compensated based on the pre-tax performance
           of the products they manage. If a portfolio manager's tenure is less
           than 5 years, performance periods will reflect time in position.
           Portfolio managers are compensated based on products they manage. A
           discretionary element of portfolio manager compensation may include
           consideration of: financial results, expense control, profit
           margins, strategic planning and implementation, quality of client
           service, market share, corporate reputation, capital allocation,
           compliance and risk control, leadership, workforce diversity,
           supervision, technology and innovation. All factors are considered
           collectively by BlackRock management.

                Cash Bonus

                Performance-based compensation is distributed to portfolio
           managers in a combination of cash and stock. Typically, the cash
           bonus, when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of
           total compensation for portfolio managers.

                Stock Bonus

                A portion of the dollar value of the total annual performance-
           based bonus is paid in restricted shares of BlackRock stock. Paying
           a portion of annual bonuses in stock puts compensation earned by a
           portfolio manager for a given year "at risk" based on the company's
           ability to sustain and improve its performance over future periods.
           The ultimate value of stock bonuses is dependent on future BlackRock
           stock price performance. As such, the stock bonus aligns each
           portfolio manager's financial interests with those of the BlackRock
           shareholders and encourages a balance between short-term goals and
           long-term strategic objectives. Management strongly believes that
           providing a significant portion of competitive performance-based
           compensation in stock is in the best interests of investors and
           shareholders. This approach ensures that portfolio managers
           participate as shareholders in both the "downside risk" and "upside
           opportunity" of the company's performance. Portfolio managers
           therefore have a direct incentive to protect BlackRock's reputation
           for integrity.

                Other Compensation Programs

                Portfolio managers who meet relative investment performance
           and financial management objectives during a performance year are
           eligible to participate in a deferred cash program. Awards under
           this program are in the form of deferred cash that may be
           benchmarked to a menu of BlackRock mutual funds (including their own
           fund) during a five-year vesting period. The deferred cash program
           aligns the interests of participating portfolio managers with the
           investment results of BlackRock products and promotes continuity of
           successful portfolio management teams.

                Other Benefits

                Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in broad-
           based plans offered generally to employees of BlackRock and its
           affiliates, including broad-based retirement, 401(k), health, and
           other employee benefit plans.

           (a)(4) Beneficial Ownership of Securities.  As of May 31, 2007,
                  neither Mr. Jaeckel nor Mr. O'Connor beneficially owned any
                  stock issued by the Fund.

           Company and Affiliated Purchasers - Not Applicable

Item 10 -  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders - The
           registrant's Nominating Committee will consider nominees to the

           Shareholders who wish to recommend a nominee should send nominations
           which include biographical information and set forth the
           qualifications of the proposed nominee to the registrant's
           Secretary.  There have been no material changes to these procedures.

Item 11 -  Controls and Procedures

           officers or persons performing similar functions have concluded that
           the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
           Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended

           financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
           (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter
           of the period covered by this report that have materially affected,
           or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
