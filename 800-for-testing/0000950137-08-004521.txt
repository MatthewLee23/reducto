PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND FUND SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE
OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The returns shown in this report do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance of share classes will vary due to differences in sales charges and
expenses. Average annual total return with sales charges includes payment of the
maximum sales charge of 3.25 percent for Class A shares, an early withdrawal
charge of 3.00 percent for Class B shares (in year one and declining to zero
after year five), an early withdrawal charge of 1.00 percent for Class C shares
in year one, and combined distribution fees and service fees of up to 0.25
percent for Class A shares and up to 1.00 percent for Class B and C shares and a
service fee of up to 0.15 percent for Class IC shares. Effective 2/18/05,
contingent deferred sales charges for Class IB and Class IC shares have been
terminated. New investments are not available in Class IB and IC shares. Figures
shown above assume reinvestment of all distributions. The fund's adviser has
waived or reimbursed fees and expenses from time to time; absent such
waivers/reimbursements, the fund's returns would have been lower.

                                                                               1

Fund Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2008

MARKET CONDITIONS

U.S. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), rose 4.9
percent in the third quarter of 2007, well above the 3.8 percent posted during
the second quarter. However, advance estimates at the end of the reporting
period show GDP expanded just 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter. The economic
slowdown translated into slower earnings growth for many corporate borrowers
within the senior loan market.

The six-month period under review was challenging for the senior loan market, as
it was for virtually all non-government bond sectors. The turmoil and
uncertainty that began in early summer persisted throughout the period as
dislocations stemming from the problems in the subprime mortgage arena permeated
the fixed income markets, leading to a significant contraction in credit and
liquidity. In an effort to spur the economy and ease the liquidity crunch, the
Federal Open Market Committee (the "Fed") lowered the target federal funds rate
a total of 2.25 percentage points during the reporting period, bringing the rate
to 3.00 percent as of the end of January. Although the Fed's moves did bring
some stability to the markets, it was relatively short-lived and riskier assets
continued to struggle as investors fled to high-quality securities.

The broad reassessment of risk pricing in the credit markets, coupled with the
significant decline in market liquidity, put considerable pressure on senior
loan prices. Although the market experienced a brief respite in September and
October, when loan values rose, a subsequent significant decline in demand and
rise in supply pushed loan values lower again. Demand from collateralized loan
obligations (CLOs) in particular, which had until recently accounted for up to
60 percent of purchases in the senior loan market, evaporated almost entirely in
the latter half of the year. At the same time, following the run up of prices in
October, a significant amount of new deals were launched. This technical
demand/supply imbalance in the market, coupled with the tightening of lending
standards, have in our view been the primary drivers of the volatility in the
senior loan market over the past several months. Increased selling by retail and
relative value investors has also pressured loan prices. Nonetheless, default
rates remain well below the historical average, though they have trended upward
slightly in recent weeks, and the overall fundamentals of the senior loan
market, in our opinion remain intact.

The performance for the five share classes varies because each has different
expenses. The Fund's total return figures assume the reinvestment of all
distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of any applicable sales charges.
Such costs would lower performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results. See Performance Summary for standardized performance information.

Although the past several months have certainly been challenging for investors,
we have not seen a meaningful decline in the credit quality of the portfolio and
we continue to see relatively strong earnings from the companies in which we
have invested. We continue to adhere to our research-intensive investment
process, employing a bottom-up asset selection process driven by thorough
analysis of individual company fundamentals, and have not relaxed our rigorous
credit standards. In fact, our team refused to participate in over 65 percent of
all the deals that were syndicated during 2006 and 2007, when a number of highly
leveraged, aggressively structured senior loans were syndicated. We believe this
has contributed to the Fund's very low default rate, which was at an all-time
low for the Fund at the end of 2007 and well below the industry average. We do
think that defaults in the senior loan market are likely to rise in the coming
months, but we believe the deals that we turned down are the ones most likely to
experience problems should the economy continue to decline.

We continued to position the portfolio defensively, generally avoiding sectors
or industries that we believe are vulnerable to cyclical economic downturns. For
example, we remain cautious about auto and airline industries because of their
susceptibility to high fuel prices. Given the decline in the residential housing
market, we have also generally avoided investments in the building and real
estate sectors. We have been very selective regarding investments in the health
care industry, particularly those assets with inherent reimbursement and
regulatory risks, but have found pockets of attractive opportunities in sub-
sectors that are not exposed to these risks. In general, we made relatively few
changes to the portfolio, and as of the end of the reporting period, the Fund's
largest sector weightings were Printing and Publishing, Healthcare and Beverage,
Food & Tobacco.

The Fund remained fully invested in senior secured loans, and used a modest
amount of leverage which may allow us to enhance the Fund's yield while keeping
credit standards high. Leverage involves borrowing at a floating short-term rate
and reinvesting the proceeds at a higher rate. Unlike other fixed-income asset
classes, using leverage in conjunction with senior loans does not

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

involve the same degree of risk from rising short-term interest rates since the
income from senior loans adjusts to changes in interest rates, as do the rates
which determine the Fund's borrowing costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates
fall, borrowing costs would also decline. The fund's portfolio, though, also
will generate less income when interest rates decline.) We might reduce leverage
in periods of weaker credit quality conditions to prevent magnifying erosion of
the Fund's net asset value.

While we believe this portfolio structure (fully invested, modest leverage) adds
value for shareholders over a full cycle, it has been a drag on performance in
the short term. Because the recent market volatility has been driven by
technical factors, rather than a change in underlying fundamentals, we have not
altered the use of leverage in the Fund as we believe it is very difficult to
"time" technical events in the market. Therefore, portfolio construction
continues to be driven by fundamental credit research. The use of leverage may,
though, increase the Fund's volatility.

Although it has been a very difficult period, it has created certain
opportunities. Loans coming to market today are offering better spreads and
stronger credit structures than we have seen in the past few years. These more
investor-friendly terms may lead to attractive risk/reward characteristics for
investors going forward. In addition, merger and acquisition activity continues,
which has historically meant greater opportunities for senior secured lenders.
The emergence of a large number of non-public funds seeking to acquire portions
of loans currently held by banks is encouraging as well, as it may serve to
reduce the supply overhang and therefore relieve some of the downward pressure
on prices in the market. We will continue to focus on maintaining a high
quality, well-diversified portfolio of issuers with stable cash flows, strong
management teams, and collateral value sufficient to provide a solid second way
out in a worst-case default scenario.

There is no guarantee that any securities mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Fund in
the future.

       in its semiannual and annual reports within 60 days of the end of the
       fund's second and fourth fiscal quarters. The semiannual reports and the

       quarters to shareholders, nor are the reports posted to the Van Kampen

       and shareholder reports (including annual privacy notices) will be
       delivered to you in this manner indefinitely unless you instruct us
       otherwise. You can request multiple copies of these documents by either

Expense Example

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments of Class A Shares
and contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions of Class B and C Shares;
and redemption fees; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees;
distribution and service fees; and other Fund expenses. This example is intended
to help you understand your ongoing cost (in dollars) of investing in the Fund
and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual
funds.

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period 8/1/07 - 1/31/08.

ACTUAL EXPENSE

The first line of the table below provides information about actual account
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the
period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number
in the first line under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to
estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES

The second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense
ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not
the Fund's actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not
be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for
the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of
investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports
of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales
charges (loads) or contingent deferred sales charges or redemption fees.
Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs
only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning
different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your
costs would have been higher.

    3.41%, 2.66% and 2.66%, for Class A, B, C, IB and IC Shares, respectively,

    184/366 (to reflect the one-half year period). These expense ratios reflect
    an expense waiver.

Percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets.

(a) All or a portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded
    loan commitments.

(b) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Payment-in-kind security.

(e) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(f) Affiliated company.

(g) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 0.1%
    of the net assets of the Fund.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2008.

(i) 144A-Private Placement security which is exempt from registration under Rule
    144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This security may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally those
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(j) Non-income producing security as the stock or warrant currently does not
    declare income dividends.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

(a) Based on average shares outstanding.

(b) Assumes reinvestment of all distributions for the period and does not
    include payment of the maximum sales charge of 3.25% or early withdrawal
    charge. On purchases of $1 million or more, an early withdrawal charge of 1%
    may be imposed on certain repurchases by the Fund made within eighteen
    months of purchase. If the sales charges were included, total returns would
    be lower. These returns include combined distribution and service fees of up
    to .25% and do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would
    pay on Fund distributions or the repurchases by the Fund of Fund shares.

(c) Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
    variable rate senior loan interests.

(d) Calculated by subtracting the Fund's total liabilities (not including the
    Borrowings) from the Fund's total assets and dividing by the total number of
    senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
    indebtedness.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2008 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment objective is to provide
a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The
Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans. Senior Loans are
business loans that have a senior right to payment and are made to borrowers
that may be corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These borrowers
operate in a variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund commenced
investment operations on October 4, 1989. The Fund continuously offers Class A
Shares, Class B Shares and Class C Shares. Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares
are not continuously offered. Each class of shares differs by its initial sales
load, contingent deferred sales charges, the allocation of class-specific
expenses and voting rights on matters affecting a single class.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans and notes are valued by the Fund
following valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the
Fund's Board of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans and notes
for which reliable market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of
such bid and ask quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available,
Senior Loans and notes are valued, where possible, using independent market
indicators provided by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees. Other Senior Loans and notes are valued by independent pricing sources
approved by the Board of Trustees based upon pricing models developed,
maintained and operated by those pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") by considering a number of factors including
consideration of market indicators, transactions in instruments which the
Adviser believes may be comparable (including comparable credit quality,
interest rate redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the
Borrower, the current interest rate, the period until the next interest rate
redetermination and the maturity of such Senior Loans. Consideration of
comparable instruments may include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of
deposit and short-term variable rate securities which have adjustment periods
comparable to the Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior
Loans are reviewed and approved by the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of
Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees. Credit default swaps are valued using market
quotations from brokers.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

    The Fund may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed
delivery" basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The
Fund will segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least
equal to the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments
until after payment is made. At January 31, 2008, the Fund had no when-issued or
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Fund acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Fund will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Fund.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for
distribution and service fees, which are unique to each class of shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required. The
Fund adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48") Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes on
January 31, 2008. FIN 48 sets forth a minimum threshold for financial statement
recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a
tax return. The implementation of FIN 48 did not result in any unrecognized tax
benefits in the accompanying financial statements. If applicable, the Fund
recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in "Interest
Expense" and penalties in "Other" expenses on the Statement of Operations. The
Fund files tax returns with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and various
states. Generally, each of the tax years in the four year period ended July 31,
2007, remains subject to examination by taxing authorities.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset these losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2007, the Fund had an

5. REPURCHASE OF SHARES

The Fund has a policy of making monthly repurchase offers ("Repurchase Offers")
for the Fund's common shares pursuant to Rule 23c-3(b) of the 1940 Act, as
amended; until October 2006 Repurchase Offers had been made at quarterly
intervals.

    On June 23, 2006, the shareholders of the Fund approved an amendment to the
Fund's fundamental policy regarding the Fund's offer to repurchase its shares to
allow the Fund to repurchase its shares on a monthly basis. In addition, on June
7, 2006, the Fund obtained exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange
Commission to enable the Fund to conduct monthly Repurchase Offers, subject to
certain conditions. The Fund began conducting monthly offers to repurchase its
outstanding shares commencing in October 2006.

                                                                              47

    The Repurchase Offers will continue to be for between 5% and 25% of the
Fund's outstanding shares; however, whereas the Fund's present intent for
quarterly offers was up to 15% during any one quarter, the Fund's present intent
for monthly offers is up to between 5% and 8% (However, the Board of Trustees
may authorize an additional 2%, if necessary, without extending the repurchase
offer.). The repurchase request deadline will be the third Friday of each
calendar month (or the preceding business day if such third Friday is not a
business day). To accommodate monthly Repurchase Offers, the Fund has shorter
notice periods before each offer, shorter repurchase periods and shorter payment
periods after each offer. During the six months ended January 31, 2008, the Fund
had no quarterly Repurchase Offers and six monthly Repurchase Offers as follows:

6. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Senior Loan agreements, the Fund had
unfunded loan commitments of approximately $88,074,600 as of January 31, 2008.
The Fund intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating
cash, liquid securities, and liquid senior loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $6,500,426 as of January 31, 2008 is
reported as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

7. BORROWINGS

The Fund has entered into a $700 million Amended and Restated Revolving Credit
and Security Agreement to finance the repurchases of shares or to purchase
additional securities for investment purposes. This revolving credit agreement
is secured by the assets of the Fund.

    In connection with this agreement, for the six months ended January 31,
2008, the Fund incurred fees of approximately $757,300. For the six months ended
January 31, 2008, the average daily balance of borrowings under the Amended and
Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement was $528,847,826 with a
weighted average interest rate of 5.45%.

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

9. DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN

Shares of the Fund are distributed by Van Kampen Funds, Inc. ("the
Distributor"), an affiliate of the Adviser. The Fund has adopted a distribution
plan (the "Distribution Plan") with respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class
B Shares and Class C Shares and in so doing has agreed to comply with rule 12b-1
under the 1940 Act, as amended, as if the Fund were an open-end investment
company. The Fund also has adopted a service plan (the "Service Plan") with
respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and Class
IC Shares. There is no Distribution Plan or Service Plan for Class IB Shares and
no Distribution Plan for Class IC Shares. All service fees under the Service
Plan applicable to Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares and Class IC
Shares are currently being waived. For the six months ended January 31, 2008,
the Distributor waived service fees of $1,531,239. This waiver is voluntary in
nature and can be discontinued at any time. Under the Distribution Plan and
Service Plan, the Fund pays distribution fees in connection with the sale and
distribution of its Shares and service fees in connection with the provision of
ongoing services to shareholders of each such class and the maintenance of
shareholder accounts.

    Under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan, the Fund may spend up to a
total of 0.25%, 1.00%, 1.00%, and 0.15% (0.25% maximum) per year of the average
daily net assets of Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC
Shares, respectively. Due to voluntary fee waivers by the Distributor, the
aggregate distribution and service fees are currently 0.00%, 0.75%, 0.75%, and
0.00% per year of the average daily net assets for Class A Shares, Class B
Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC Shares, respectively. Annual fees under the
Distribution Plan and Service Plan are accrued daily. The net annual fees for
Class B Shares and Class C Shares are paid monthly to the Distributor.

    The amount of distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and not yet
reimbursed ("unreimbursed receivable") was approximately $787,100 and $3,841,200
for Class B Shares and Class C Shares, respectively. These amounts may be
recovered from future payments under the Distribution Plan. To the extent the
unreimbursed receivable has been fully recovered, any excess fees will be
refunded to the Fund on a quarterly basis.

10. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

                                                                              49
<PAGE>

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

    The Fund may use derivative instruments for a variety of reasons, such as to
attempt to protect the Fund against possible changes in the market value of its
portfolio or to generate potential gain. All of the Fund's portfolio holdings,
including derivative instruments, are marked to market each day with the change
in value reflected in unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Risks may arise as a
result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts.

    The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes
or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Fund may otherwise invest. A credit
default swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit risk of
an issuer. A buyer of a credit default swap is said to buy protection by paying
periodic fees in return for a contingent payment from the seller if the issuer
has a credit event such as bankruptcy, a failure to pay outstanding obligations
or deteriorating credit while the swap is outstanding. A seller of a credit
default swap is said to sell protection and thus collects the periodic fees and
profits if the credit of the issuer remains stable or improves while the swap is
outstanding but the seller in a credit default swap contract would be required
to pay an agreed-upon amount, which approximates the notional amount of the swap
as disclosed in the table following the Portfolio of Investments, to the buyer
in the event of an adverse credit event of the issuer. The Fund accrues for the
periodic fees on credit default swaps on a daily basis with the net amount
accrued recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of swap contracts.
Upon cash settlement of the periodic fees, the net amount is recorded as
realized gain/loss on swap contracts on the Statements of Operations. Net
unrealized gains are recorded as an asset or net unrealized losses are reported
as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Payments received or
made upon entering into a credit default swap contract, if any, are recorded as
realized gain or loss on the Statement of Operations upon termination or
maturity of the swap. The change in value of the swap contracts is reported as
unrealized gains or losses on the Statement of Operations.

    Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if the Fund had invested
in the issuer directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general market risk,
counterparty risk and credit risk. If there is a default by the counterparty,
the Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to
the transaction. Counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based
on the valuation of each swap) on behalf of the Fund with a value approximately
equal to the amount of any unrealized gain. Cash collateral, when received by
the Fund, is recorded with an offsetting liability shown on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities. Reciprocally, when the Fund has an unrealized loss on a
swap contract, the Fund has instructed the custodian to pledge cash or liquid
securities as collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the
unrealized loss. Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if
and when the swap valuations fluctuate. Restricted cash, if any, for segregating
purposes is shown on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

11. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

12. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. As of January 31, 2008, the Adviser does not believe the adoption
of SFAS 157 will impact the amounts reported in the financial statements,
however, additional disclosures will be required about the inputs used to
develop the measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements
reported on the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.

                                                                              51

I, Stuart N. Schuldt, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSRS of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund;

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

     a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
         disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
         supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
         registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
         us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
         which this report is being prepared;

     b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
         internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
         supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
         of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
         external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
         principles;

     c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
         procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
         effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
         within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
         evaluation; and

     d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting that occurred during the second fiscal
         quarter of the period covered by this report that has materially
         affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
         registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
         operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
         reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
         record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
         employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
         controls over financial reporting.
