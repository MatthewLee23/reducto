LETTER FROM THE CEO
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders,

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

As a professional investor for more than 20 years, I've often been asked to
name the single most important factor in investment success. My answer is
always the same: diversification. At MFS we talk about applying a disciplined
diversification(SM) strategy to a portfolio as a three step process: allocate
among the major asset classes; diversify within each asset class; and rebalance
regularly to avoid unnecessary risk.

Individual investors sometimes assume that the amount they're putting away is
too small to allow for diversification. My response would be that a good
investment plan, developed with the help of an investment professional, should
provide a way to properly diversify your contributions.

Remember that the purpose of diversification is to own investments that
historically have not moved in sync with each other - in the hope that, in any
given period, underperforming holdings will be somewhat counteracted by other
outperforming holdings. If none of your asset classes did badly in the past
year or so, you're probably not properly diversified.

Americans today have more of their wealth tied up in the markets than in any
previous period of our history, but we are not yet making the most of our
opportunities. While neither asset allocation nor diversification can guarantee
a profit or protect against a loss, I would voice the opinion that, to a large
extent, a failure to have a plan, diversify contributions, and rebalance a
portfolio annually has been behind many U.S. investors' failure to reach their
long-term financial goals.

For more information on how to apply a disciplined diversification(SM) strategy
to your portfolio, I would urge you to contact your own investment
professional. You may also want to refer to information on the subject on our
Website, MFS.COM.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For the six months ended April 30, 2005, shares of the MFS Municipal Income
Trust provided a total return of 5.36%, at net asset value. In comparison, the
trust's benchmarks, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index (the Lehman Index)
and the Lipper Closed-End High Yield Municipal Index, returned 1.93% and 5.07%,
respectively. The trust seeks to provide high current income exempt from federal
income taxes. The trust invests 80% of its assets, under normal circumstances,
in tax exempt securities which are rated below the three highest rating
categories of recognized rating agencies.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT

The U.S. fixed-income market experienced a flattening of the yield curve during
the six-month period. (A yield curve for bonds shows the relationship between
yield and time to maturity.) The U.S. Federal Reserve Board raised its target
federal funds rate four times, continuing its steady drumbeat of quarter-point
rate hikes that had begun on June 30, 2004. But while the Fed seemed committed
to a course of gradually raising short-term rates, several factors caused
long-term rates to stagnate or retreat.

Job growth, which had shot up in the spring of 2004, ebbed and flowed during the
period; uncertainty about the employment situation helped to push down yields on
longer-dated bonds. Another factor that held long-term rates down was overseas
demand for U.S. Treasuries, especially from foreign central banks. However,
moderate GDP growth and inflation concerns kept shorter-term interest rates
moving up. For the period as a whole, the net effect was a substantial
flattening of the yield curve as short-term rates rose significantly while
long-term rates were generally flat to down.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

Security selection and an overweighting in the strong-performing health care
sector boosted the trust's performance relative to one of our benchmarks, the
Lehman Index. Security selection in the utilities, industrials, and
transportation sectors also aided relative results during the period.

Relative performance was also positively impacted by credit quality. The trust
benefited from its exposure to high yield debt, as "BBB"-rated bonds
outperformed higher-quality issues over the period. In addition, the trust's
positions in non-investment-grade debt, which is not held by the Lehman Index,
also aided relative returns.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

Our positioning along the yield curve detracted from relative performance for
the period. (A yield curve graphically depicts the yields of different maturity
bonds of the same credit quality and type. A normal yield curve is upward
sloping, with short-term rates lower than long-term rates.) Compared with the
Lehman Index, the trust was underweighted in bonds on the long end of the curve
(represented by bonds with durations of 11-to-25+ years). (Duration is a
measure of a portfolio's sensitivity to changes in interest rates.) On a
relative basis, our underweighting in longer-maturity bonds hurt relative
performance as long-term municipal bond rates declined during the period.

INDEX DEFINITIONS

Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index - is a market-value-weighted index
representative of the tax-exempt bond market.

Lipper Closed-End High Yield Municipal Index - measures the performance of the
closed-end funds in the Lipper database which invest at least 50% of assets in
lower-rated municipal debt issues.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount to net asset value. Shareholders do
not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their shares at net asset
value. The trust's shares also may trade at a premium to their net asset value.

When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset value
underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive less
than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As a
result, the total return that is calculated based on the net asset value and New
York Stock Exchange price can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes as
a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her shares
and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be treated as
gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of shareholder capital
have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and increasing the trust's
expense ratio.

From time to time the trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements,
without which performance would be lower.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

The portfolio invests in municipal securities that are general obligations
backed by the full faith and credit of the municipal issuer and revenue
obligations that are not backed by the issuer. Therefore, revenue obligations
are subject to a higher degree of credit risk than general obligations.

Any municipal security that is backed by current or anticipated revenues from
a specific project or specific assets can be negatively affected by the
discontinuance of the taxation supporting the project or assets or the
inability to collect revenues for the project or from the assets. If the
Internal Revenue Service determines an issuer of a municipal security has not
complied with applicable tax requirements, interest from the security could
become taxable and the security could decline significantly in value.

The portfolio may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures,
options and swaps. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The portfolio invests in high yield or lower-rated securities which may provide
greater returns but are subject to greater-than-average risk.

A portion of income may be subject to state, federal, and/or alternative minimum
tax. Capital gains, if any, are subject to a capital gains tax.

The portfolio's value will fluctuate in response to market conditions and
issuer, regulatory, economic, or political developments. In general, fixed
income securities will decline when interest rates rise and will increase when
interest rates fall. Many fixed income securities also involve credit risk,
which is the risk that issuers may fail to make timely principal or interest
payments. In addition, fixed income securities with longer maturity dates will
be subject to greater price fluctuations than those with shorter maturity
periods.

The portfolio may invest a higher percentage of its assets in a small number of
issuers. The portfolio is more susceptible to any (non-diversified) single
economic, political or regulatory event affecting those issuers than is a
diversified fund.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of the
trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on such
terms as the Trustees shall determine.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows you
to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If the
shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted price of
either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.
Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in any amount
over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are bought
on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each participant
pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic reinvestment of
distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may be payable (or
required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please have
available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security numbers.
For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts, instructions
must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details. When you
withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested shares in
one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional shares, or a
certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional shares.

The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the trust's financial performance for the semiannual period
and the past 5 fiscal years (or, if shorter, the period of the trust's operation). Certain information reflects financial
results for a single trust share. The total returns in the table represent the rate by which an investor would have earned (or
lost) on an investment in the trust (assuming reinvestment of all distributions) held for the entire period.

 (S) As required, effective November 1, 2001, the trust has adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for
     Investment Companies and began accreting market discount on debt securities. The effect of this change for the year ended
     October 31, 2002 was to increase net investment income per share by $0.01, decrease net realized and unrealized gains and
     losses per share by $0.01, and to increase the ratio of net investment income to average net assets by 0.07%. Per share,
     ratios, and supplemental data for periods prior to November 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
     presentation.
   + Ratio excludes dividend payment on auction preferred shares.
  ++ Calculated by substracting the trust's total liabilities (not including preferred shares) from the trust's total assets
     and dividing this by the number of preferred shares outstanding.
   # Per share data are based on average shares outstanding.
  ## Ratios do not reflect reductions from fees paid indirectly.
 (+) Annualized.
(++) Not annualized.
   * The reimbursement per share amount and ratios were less than $0.01 and 0.01%, respectively.
   & From time to time the trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements, without which performance would be lower.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Municipal Income Trust (the trust) is a non-diversified trust that is
organized as a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end management
investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The trust
can invest up to 100% of its portfolio in high-yield securities rated below
investment grade. Investments in high-yield securities involve greater degrees
of credit and market risk than investments in higher-rated securities and tend
to be more sensitive to economic conditions. Municipal securities backed by
current or anticipated revenues from a specific project or specific assets can
be negatively affected by the discontinuance of the taxation supporting the
projects or assets or the inability to collect revenues for the project or from
the assets. If the Internal Revenue Service determines an issuer of a municipal
security has not complied with applicable tax requirements, interest from the
security could become taxable and the security could decline in value.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Bonds and other fixed income securities (other than
short-term obligations) in the trust's portfolio are valued at an evaluated bid
price as reported by an independent pricing service, or to the extent a
valuation is not reported by a pricing service, such securities are valued on
the basis of quotes from brokers and dealers. Prices obtained from pricing
services utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing
techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data without exclusive reliance upon quoted prices or exchange or over-the-
counter prices, since such valuations are believed to reflect more accurately
the fair value of such securities. Short-term obligations with a remaining
maturity in excess of 60 days will be valued upon dealer-supplied valuations.
All other short-term obligations in the trust's portfolio are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value as determined by the Board of
Trustees. When pricing service information or market quotations are not readily
available, securities are priced at fair value as determined under the direction
of the Board of Trustees.

SWAP AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into swap agreements. A swap is an
exchange of cash payments between the trust and another party, which is based on
a specific financial index. Cash payments are exchanged at specified intervals
and the expected income or expense is recorded on the accrual basis. The value
of the swap is adjusted daily and the change in value is recorded as unrealized
appreciation or depreciation. Risks may arise upon entering into these
agreements from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of
their contract and from unanticipated changes in the value of the financial
index on which the swap agreement is based. The trust uses swaps for both
hedging and non-hedging purposes. For hedging purposes, the trust may use swaps
to reduce its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. For
non-hedging purposes, the trust may use swaps to take a position on anticipated
changes in the underlying financial index.

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS - Interest rate swap agreements are agreements to
exchange cash flows periodically based on a notional principal amount, for
example the exchange of fixed rate interest payments for floating rate interest
payments which are based on a specific financial index, or the exchange of two
distinct floating rate payments. The net receivable or payable associated with
these payments is accrued daily and is recorded as net interest income or
expense. For financial statement purposes, the net interest income or expense
periodically recognized for an interest rate swap is recorded in the same line
item as any unrealized and realized gains or losses recognized for that
instrument. The primary risk associated with interest rate swap agreements is
that unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of interest rates could adversely
impact the trust.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on the
trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium and
discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All premium and original
issue discount is amortized or accreted for tax reporting purposes as required
by federal income tax regulations. The trust may receive proceeds from
litigation settlements involving its portfolio holdings. Any proceeds received
are reflected in realized gain/loss in the statement of operations, or in
unrealized gain/loss if the security is still held by the trust. Legal fees and
other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the value of a security
owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal fees are expensed.
Capital infusions made directly to the security issuer, which are generally
non-recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of high- yield debt
securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the security. Costs
that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of capital infusions or
that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization are reported as realized
losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance an investment, or costs
incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are expensed.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
trust. This amount, for the six months ended April 30, 2005, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net tax-
exempt and taxable net income, including any net realized gain on investments.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.
Distributions paid by the trust from net interest received on tax-exempt
municipal bonds are not includable by shareholders as gross income for federal
income tax purposes because the trust intends to meet certain requirements of
the Code applicable to regulated investment companies, which will enable the
trust to pay exempt-interest dividends. The portion of such interest, if any,
earned on private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986 may be considered a
tax-preference item to shareholders.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the financial
statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for defaulted bonds, capital losses, and amortization and accretion
on debt securities.

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended October 31, 2004
and October 31, 2003 was as follows:

                                                 10/31/04           10/31/03

losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

          Undistributed tax-exempt income                 $7,792,198
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Undistributed ordinary income                       60,086

          Other temporary differences                       (918,644)

For federal income tax purposes, the capital loss carryforward may be applied
against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the
earlier of its utilization or expiration.

both series through an auction process. During the six months ended April 30,
2005 the dividend rates ranged from 1.495% to 2.76%. The trust pays an annual
fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred share liquidation value for remarketing
efforts associated with the preferred auction. The APS are redeemable at the
option of the trust in whole or in part at the redemption price equal to $25,000
per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The APS are also subject to
mandatory redemption if certain requirements relating to its asset maintenance
coverage are not satisfied. The trust is required to maintain certain asset
coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the trust's By-Laws and the
Investment Company Act of 1940.

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.40% of
the trust's average daily net assets and 6.32% of gross investment income.
Management fees from net assets and gross investment income incurred for the six
months ended April 30, 2005 were at an effective rate of 0.79% of average daily
net assets, including preferred shares, on an annualized basis.

The trust pays compensation to its Independent Trustees in the form of a
retainer, attendance fees, and additional compensation to Board and Committee
chairpersons, and pays no compensation directly to its Trustees who are officers
of the investment adviser, or to officers of the trust, all of whom receive
remuneration for their services to the trust from MFS. Certain officers and
Trustees of the trust are officers or directors of MFS and MFS Service Center,
Inc. (MFSC). The trust has an unfunded defined benefit plan for retired
Independent Trustees. Included in Trustees' compensation is a pension expense of
$4,687 for retired Independent Trustees for the six months ended April 30, 2005.

This trust and certain other MFS funds (the "funds") have entered into a
services agreement (the "Agreement") which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an Independent
Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an officer of the
funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. MFS has agreed to reimburse each of
the funds for a proportional share of substantially all of the payments made by
the funds to Tarantino LLC and also to provide office space and other
administrative support and supplies to the ICCO. The funds can terminate the
Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the Agreement.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to certain funds
for which MFS acts as investment adviser. Under an administrative services
agreement between the funds and MFS, MFS is entitled to partial reimbursement of
the costs MFS incurs to provide these services, subject to review and approval
by the Board of Trustees. Each fund is allocated a portion of these
administrative costs based on its size and relative average net assets. The
trust paid MFS an administrative fee up to the following annual percentage rates
of the trust's average daily net assets:

                                   BEGINNING OF

For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the trust paid MFS $20,655, equivalent
to 0.00915% of average daily net assets including preferred shares, to partially
reimburse MFS for the costs of providing administrative services.

TRANSFER AGENT - Included in transfer agent and dividend disbursing costs is a
fee paid to MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, for its services as
registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the trust. The agreement provides
that the trust will pay MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00
and a dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. These fees amounted to
$32,615 for the six months ended April 30, 2005. Also included in transfer agent
and dividend disbursing costs are out-of-pocket expenses, paid to MFSC, which
amounted to $38,009 for the six months ended April 30, 2005, as well as other
expenses paid to unaffiliated vendors.

(4) PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

Purchases and sales of investments, other than U.S. government securities,
purchased option transactions, and short-term obligations, aggregated
$36,847,003 and $33,046,551, respectively.

The cost and unrealized appreciation and depreciation in the value of the
investments owned by the trust, as computed on a federal income tax basis, are
as follows:

          Aggregate cost                                $425,560,577
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Gross unrealized appreciation                  $31,180,209
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Gross unrealized depreciation                   (3,093,094)
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)     $28,087,115
          ----------------------------------------------------------

(5) SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The trust's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized the repurchase by the trust of up to 10% annually of its own shares
of beneficial interest.

During the six months ended April 30, 2005, the trust did not repurchase any
shares. Transactions in the trust were as follows:


                                Six months ended 4/30/05  Year ended 10/31/04
                                   SHARES      AMOUNT      SHARES     AMOUNT

Shares issued to shareholders in
reinvestment of distributions        17,976     $141,292    64,891    $511,173
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other affiliated funds participate in a $1 billion unsecured line
of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit agreement.
Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to
each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve funds
rate plus 0.35%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average daily,
unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the participating funds
at the end of each calendar quarter. The commitment fee allocated to the trust
for the six months ended April 30, 2005 was $1,255, and is included in
miscellaneous expense. The trust had no significant borrowings during the six
months ended April 30, 2005.

(7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The trust trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal
course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to market risks
such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These financial
instruments include swap agreements. The notional or contractual amounts of
these instruments represent the investment the trust has in particular classes
of financial instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts
potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these
instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are
considered.

(8) RESTRICTED SECURITIES

At April 30, 2005, the trust owned the following restricted securities which are
subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale, excluding securities
issued under Rule 144A, constituting 2.18% of net assets, including preferred
shares, which may not be publicly sold without registration under the Securities
Act of 1933. The trust does not have the right to demand that such securities be
registered. The value of these securities is determined by valuations furnished
by dealers or by a pricing service, or if not available, in good faith at the
direction of the Trustees.

(9) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

At April 30, 2005, 19.27% of securities in the portfolio of investments are
backed by letters of credit or bond insurance of various financial institutions
and financial guaranty assurance agencies. The percentage of investments insured
by or supported (backed) by a letter of credit from any one institution or
agency did not exceed 9.46% of total investments.

(10) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 31, 2004, MFS settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding disclosure of brokerage allocation
practices in connection with MFS fund sales (the term "MFS funds" means the
open-end registered management investment companies sponsored by MFS). Under the
terms of the settlement, in which MFS neither admitted nor denied any
wrongdoing, MFS agreed to pay (one dollar) $1.00 in disgorgement and $50 million
in penalty to certain MFS funds, pursuant to a plan developed by an independent
distribution consultant. The brokerage allocation practices which were the
subject of this proceeding were discontinued by MFS in November 2003. The
agreement with the SEC is reflected in an order of the SEC. The SEC settlement
order states that MFS failed to adequately disclose to the Boards of Trustees
and to shareholders of the MFS funds the specifics of its preferred arrangements
with certain brokerage firms selling MFS fund shares. The SEC settlement order
states that MFS had in place policies designed to obtain best execution of all
MFS fund trades. As part of the settlement, MFS retained an independent
compliance consultant to review the completeness of its current policies and
practices regarding disclosure to MFS fund trustees and to MFS fund shareholders
of strategic alliances between MFS or its affiliates and broker-dealers and
other financial intermediaries who support the sale of MFS fund shares. Pursuant
to the SEC order, on July 28, 2004, MFS transferred these settlement amounts to
the SEC, and those MFS funds entitled to these settlement amounts accrued an
estimate of their pro rata portion of these amounts. The final distribution plan
was approved by the SEC on January 21, 2005, and the affected MFS funds received
the payment on February 16, 2005.

In addition, in February 2004, MFS reached agreement with the SEC, the New York
Attorney General ("NYAG") and the Bureau of Securities Regulation of the State
of New Hampshire ("NH") to settle administrative proceedings alleging false and
misleading information in certain MFS open-end retail fund ("MFS retail funds")
prospectuses regarding market timing and related matters (the "February
Settlements"). These regulators alleged that prospectus language for certain MFS
retail funds was false and misleading because, although the prospectuses for
those funds in the regulators' view indicated that they prohibited market
timing, MFS did not limit trading activity in 11 domestic large cap stock, high
grade bond and money market retail funds. MFS' former Chief Executive Officer
and former President also reached agreement with the SEC in which they agreed
to, among other terms, monetary fines and temporary suspensions from association
with any investment adviser or registered investment company. These individuals
have resigned their positions with, and will not be returning to, MFS and the
MFS funds. Under the terms of the February Settlements, MFS and the executives
neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.

Under the terms of the February Settlements, a $225 million pool has been
established for distribution to shareholders in certain MFS retail funds, which
has been funded by MFS and of which $50 million is characterized as a penalty.
This pool will be distributed in accordance with a methodology developed by an
independent distribution consultant in consultation with MFS and the Board of
Trustees of the MFS retail funds, and acceptable to the SEC. MFS has further
agreed with NYAG to reduce its management fees in the aggregate amount of
approximately $25 million annually over the next five years, and not to increase
certain management fees during this period. MFS has also paid an administrative
fine to NH in the amount of $1 million, which will be used for investor
education purposes (NH retained $250,000 and $750,000 was contributed to the
North American Securities Administrators Association's Investor Protection
Trust). In addition, under the terms of the February Settlements, MFS is in the
process of adopting certain governance changes and reviewing its policies and
procedures.

Since December 2003, MFS, MFS Fund Distributors, Inc., MFS Service Center, Inc.,
MFS Corporation Retirement Committee, Sun Life Financial Inc., various MFS
funds, certain current and/or former Trustees of these MFS funds, and certain
officers of MFS have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits filed in
federal and state courts. The lawsuits variously have been commenced as class
actions or individual actions on behalf of investors who purchased, held or
redeemed shares of the MFS funds during specified periods, as ERISA actions by
participants in certain retirement plan accounts on behalf of those accounts, or
as derivative actions on behalf of the MFS funds. The lawsuits relating to
market timing and related matters have been transferred to, and consolidated
before, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, as part
of a multi-district litigation of market timing and related claims involving
several other fund complexes (In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation (Alger,
Columbia, Janus, MFS, One Group, Putnam, Allianz Dresdner), No. 1:04-md-15863
(transfer began March 19, 2004)). The market timing cases related to the MFS
complex are Riggs v. MFS et al., Case No. 04-cv-01162-JFM (direct), Hammerslough
v. MFS et al., Case No. 04-md-01620 (derivative) and Anita Walker v. MFS et al.,
Case No. 1:04-CV-01758 (ERISA). The plaintiffs in these consolidated lawsuits
generally seek injunctive relief including removal of the named Trustees,
adviser and distributor, rescission of contracts and 12b-1 Plans, disgorgement
of fees and profits, monetary damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees and
costs and other equitable and declaratory relief. Two lawsuits alleging improper
brokerage allocation practices and excessive compensation are pending in the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Forsythe v. Sun
Life Financial Inc., et al., No. 04cv10584 (GAO) (a consolidated action) and
Marcus Dumond, et al. v. Massachusetts Financial Servs. Co., et al., No.
04cv11458 (GAO)). The plaintiffs in these lawsuits generally seek compensatory
damages, punitive damages, recovery of fees, rescission of contracts, an
accounting, restitution, declaratory relief, equitable and/or injunctive relief
and attorney's fees and costs. The various lawsuits generally allege that some
or all of the defendants (i) permitted or acquiesced in market timing and/or
late trading in some of the MFS funds, inadequately disclosed MFS' internal
policies concerning market timing and such matters (ii) received excessive
compensation as fiduciaries to the MFS funds, or (iii) permitted or acquiesced
in the improper use of fund assets by MFS to support the distribution of MFS
fund shares and inadequately disclosed MFS' use of fund assets in this manner.
The actions assert that some or all of the defendants violated the federal
securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
well as fiduciary duties and other violations of common law. Insofar as any of
the actions is appropriately brought derivatively on behalf of any of the MFS
funds, any recovery will inure to the benefit of the MFS funds. In February,
March, and April 2005, the defendants filed separate motions to dismiss all
claims of the various lawsuits. The parties continue to brief the issues for the
courts and various hearing dates have been scheduled. Additional lawsuits based
on similar allegations may be filed in the future.

Any potential resolution of these matters may include, but not be limited to,
judgments or settlements for damages against MFS, the MFS funds, or any other
named defendant. As noted above, as part of the regulatory settlements, MFS has
established a restitution pool in the amount of $225 million to compensate
certain shareholders of certain MFS retail funds for damages that they allegedly
sustained as a result of market timing or late trading in certain of the MFS
retail funds, and distributed $50 million to affected MFS funds to compensate
those funds based upon the amount of brokerage commissions allocated in
recognition of MFS fund sales. It is not clear whether these amounts will be
sufficient to compensate shareholders for all of the damage they allegedly
sustained, whether certain shareholders or putative class members may have
additional claims to compensation, or whether the damages that may be awarded in
any of the actions will exceed these amounts. In the event the MFS funds incur
any losses, costs or expenses in connection with such lawsuits, the Boards of
Trustees of the affected MFS funds may pursue claims on behalf of such funds
against any party that may have liability to the funds in respect thereof.

Review of these matters by the independent Trustees of the MFS funds and their
counsel is continuing. There can be no assurance that these regulatory actions
and lawsuits, or the adverse publicity associated with these developments, will
not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced sales of fund shares, or other
adverse consequences to the MFS funds.

While these developments relate to MFS and the MFS' open-end funds, there can be
no assurance that these developments, or the adverse publicity associated with
these developments, will not result in an increase to the market discount of the
MFS closed-end fund shares or other adverse consequences.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Municipal Income Trust:

We have reviewed the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of the MFS Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust"),
as of April 30, 2005, and the related statement of operations, statement of
changes in net assets, and the financial highlights for the six-month period
then ended. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the
Trust's management.

We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial
information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making
inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should
be made to such interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statement of assets and
liabilities, including the portfolio of investments, of the MFS Municipal Income
Trust (the "Trust"), as of October 31, 2004, and the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended; and in our report dated
December 20, 2004, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial
statements.

The statement of changes in net assets for the year ended October 31, 2004 and
the financial highlights for the five year in period ended October 31, 2004
taken from these financial statements are included herein.

                                       (AS REVISED FEBRUARY, 2004 AND MAY, 2005)

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                          PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (this "Code") has been adopted by the funds
(collectively, "Funds" and each, "Fund") under supervision of the MFS Funds
Board and Compass Board of Trustees/Managers (the "Boards") and applies to the
Funds' Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the "Covered
Officers" each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:

         o  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships;

         o  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submits to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by the Funds;

         o  compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules
            and regulations;

         o  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o  accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.  CONDUCT GUIDELINES

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer should
not place his or her personal interests ahead of the Funds' interests and should
endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
Covered Officer must:

         o  not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
            improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
            for any Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to
            the detriment of the Fund; and

         o  not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
            individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
            benefit the Fund.

         The following activities, which could create the appearance of a
conflict of interest, are permitted only with the approval of the Funds' Chief
Legal Officer ("CLO"):

         o  service as a director on the board of any "for profit" company;

         o  running for political office;

         o  the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;

         o  the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
            has current or prospective business dealings unless such
            entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
            as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
            of impropriety;

         o  any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
            relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian
            banks, audit firms), other than the Funds' investment adviser,
            principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
            thereof;

         o  a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
            charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
            transactions or for selling or redeeming shares, other than an
            interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment or securities
            ownership.


III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o  Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
            disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;

         o  each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
            others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within
            or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors,
            and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o  each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
            her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and
            employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting
            full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
            reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
            in other public communications made by the Funds; and

         o  it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
            compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the
            standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
            regulations.


IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o  upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
            becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he
            or she has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o  annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied
            with the requirements of the Code;

         o  annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are
            or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the
            Covered Officer's duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual
            Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;

         o  not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or
            employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
            potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o  notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this
            Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.


The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
questions are presented under it, granting waivers upon consultation with the
appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will
report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board (or a designee thereof)
promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the
appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.

         The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
         violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the
         appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has occurred,
         it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
         appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
         board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer.

         Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.


V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or
policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their investment adviser or other
service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority
of independent trustees.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be
maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or
this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Funds' Board, its counsel, counsel to the Board's independent
trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Fund's
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

         CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT


    I, Maria F. Dwyer, certify that:

    1. I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of MFS Municipal Income Trust;

    2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
       of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
       statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such
       statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered
       by this report;

    3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
       information included in this report, fairly present in all material
       respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
       assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to
       include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the
       periods presented in this report;

    4. The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
       establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
       defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for
       the registrant and have:

       a. designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

       b. evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

       c. disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by the report that has materially
          affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

    5. The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
       registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board
       of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

       a. all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

       b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
