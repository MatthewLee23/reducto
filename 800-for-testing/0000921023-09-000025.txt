President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

Stock and bond markets around the globe have been experiencing one of their
most tumultuous periods in history. Investors have witnessed volatility of a
magnitude that many have never before seen. Distance often provides the best
vantage point for perspective. Still, we believe that the benefits of basic
investment principles that have stood the test of time -- even in the midst of
market turmoil -- cannot be underestimated.

First, invest for the long term. The founder of Pioneer Investments, Philip L.
Carret, began his investment career during the 1920s. One lesson he learned is
that while great prosperity affords an advantageous time for selling stocks,
extreme economic slumps can create opportunities for purchase. Indeed, many of
our portfolio managers, who follow the value-conscious investing approach of
our founder, are looking at recent market conditions as an opportunity to buy
companies whose shares we believe have been unjustifiably beaten down by
indiscriminate selling, but that we have identified as having strong prospects
over time. While investors may be facing a sustained market downturn, we
continue to believe that patience, along with staying invested in the market,
are important considerations for long-term investors.

A second principle is to stay diversified across different types of
investments. The global scope of the current market weakness poses challenges
for this basic investment axiom. But the turbulence makes now a good time to
reassess your portfolio and make sure that your investments continue to meet
your needs. We believe you should work closely with your financial advisor to
find the mix of stocks, bonds and money market assets that is best aligned to
your particular risk tolerance and investment objective.

As the investment markets sort through the continuing crisis in the financial
industry, we are staying focused on the fundamentals and risk management. With
more than 80 years of experience behind us, we have learned how to navigate
turbulent markets. At Pioneer Investments, risk management has always been a
critical part of our culture -- not just during periods of extraordinary
volatility. Our investment process is based on fundamental research,
quantitative analysis and active portfolio management. This three-pillared
process, which we apply to each of our portfolios, is supported by an
integrated team approach and is designed to carefully balance risk and reward.
While we see potential chances for making money in many corners of the market,
it takes

research and experience to separate solid investment opportunities from
speculation.

We invite you to learn more about Pioneer and our time-tested approach to
investing by consulting with your financial advisor or visiting us online at
www.pioneerinvestments.com. Thank you for investing with Pioneer.

Sincerely,

/s/ Daniel K. Kingsbury

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/09

After struggling during the final months of 2008, the bank loan market began to
recover in 2009 as investors saw opportunity in the low prices of loans. In the
following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses the performance of Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust during the six months ended May 31, 2009. Mr. Sharkey, a
member of Pioneer's Fixed Income Department, is responsible for the daily
management of the Trust.

Q    How did the Trust perform over the six months ended May 31, 2009?

A    For the six-month period ended May 31, 2009, Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
     returned 19.19% at net asset value and 33.78% at market price. The Trust's
     benchmark, the Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index (the CSFB Index),
     returned 17.72% over the same period. Unlike the Trust, the Index does not
     employ leverage. At the end of May 2009, the Trust was selling at a
     discount of market price-to-net asset value of 10.16%, which was slightly
     more than its peers; and the Trust's SEC yield was 6.90%. In April 2009, we
     reduced the Trust's dividend rate, a cut back which resulted from a decline
     in LIBOR (the London Interbank Offering Rate), which had risen to a
     historic level relative to the federal funds rate, and the rising number of
     defaults in the portfolio.

     Unlike open-ended funds, the market prices of closed-end funds go up and
     down based on supply and demand, irrespective of a closed-end fund's net
     asset value per share. It isn't unusual to find closed-end funds trading at
     a discount to the Trust's net asset value. At the end of the period,
     closed-end funds on average were trading at discounts to their actual
     underlying value.

Q    What were the principal factors affecting the Trust's performance during
     the six months ended May 31, 2009?

A    The final months of 2008 saw floating-rate bank loans decline in value in
     the aftermath of the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers and the
     collapse or near-collapse of several other financial institutions, some of
     which required government bailouts. One of the significant factors leading
     to the selling pressure in the market occurred as hedge funds unwound their
     bank loan portfolios at a time when few buyers were interested, especially
     as the number of defaults increased. During that period, the average price
     of a bank loan fell to about 63 cents on the dollar. Much of the debt that
     was sold off by hedge funds was rated B and CCC, and Pioneer Floating Rate
     Trust, with its average credit rating of B, experienced significant price
     erosion. In that situation, we liquidated parts of the portfolio and built
     up a cash position that was slightly larger than 10% of the market value of
     the

4    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09
<PAGE>

     Trust. We felt that the relatively large cash position would provide
     adequate credit quality and allow the Trust to continue to pay dividends.

     During the first three months of the reporting period, liquidity dried up,
     companies could not refinance debt, the bankruptcy recovery rate was low,
     and investors favored quality above everything else. As a result, higher-
     quality securities rallied. During the second three months of the period
     from March 2009 through May 2009, we began to see a rally in the rest of
     the market, as investors perceived good value and decided to put their cash
     back to work. Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs), which represent
     nearly 60% of investments in loans, purchased more BB-rated bank loans due
     to the combination of excess cash on hand from the purchase of Alltel
     Cellular by Verizon and the structural benefits of adding loans at 80 cents
     on the dollar. There also were significantly fewer auctioned portfolios.
     Stability returned to the market, which boosted investor confidence and
     resulted in increased investing in lower-rated (B, CCC-rated) loans, which
     make up a substantial portion of the Trust's portfolio, as investors looked
     for more yield. In that environment, lower-quality securities rallied.

Q    Can you comment on the use of leverage in the Trust's portfolio?

A    We believe the use of leverage for investment purposes can increase
     investment opportunity, as well as investment risk. The Trust uses
     financial leverage primarily to increase the dividend yield to shareowners.
     During the six-month period ended May 31, 2009, the Trust utilized
     auction-rate preferred shares as a low-cost way of borrowing to provide
     leverage for the Trust. In December 2008, we reduced the amount of leverage
     in the Trust.

     Because of the auction failures and the steep decline in the average price
     of bank loans, the Trust postponed its dividend for November 2008. However,
     after liquidating parts of the portfolio and building up a cash position,
     the Trust was able to pay the November dividend on December 9, 2008.

Q    What types of investments most helped or hurt the Trust's performance
     during the six months ended May 31, 2009?

A    During the reporting period, we used the Trust's cash to diversify the
     portfolio and upgrade the credit quality. As we got further confidence
     during the year that the loan market had realized a floor of stability that
     would help ensure our ability to satisfy all the requirements and tests to
     ensure the dividend, we started to add exposure to the Trust's portfolio.
     Given the backdrop of pending increased default rates for the loan asset
     class in 2009, the bulk of cash was deployed in more "up-in-quality" names
     that we believed would continue to readily pay interest for the Trust, and
     thus preserve capital. This strategy would also help us to maintain the
     flexibility to manage through the tests to pay our dividends on the Trust.

                Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09     5

     An overweight to broadcasting and cable companies benefited the Trust's
     performance. Among cable companies, the Spanish-language network Univision
     stands out. Retailers, such as Toys R US and Dollar General, also helped
     boost the Trust's return. While retailers suffered late in 2008, they
     rallied earlier this year when year-over-year sales results weren't as bad
     as expected. Investments in airlines also contributed to the Trust's
     performance. Airlines had made substantial cutbacks in costs and capacity
     in 2008, and we found the valuations to be at attractive levels. Positions
     in health care and telecommunications also aided the Trust's results.

     On the negative side, the Trust's investments in CLO bonds were the biggest
     drawback to performance, and any investment related to real estate or
     gaming held back results. In addition, the default rate of the loans held
     by the Trust was greater than usual during the six-month period ended May
     31, 2009. As companies defaulted on loans, their values declined and, in
     some cases, interest payments were suspended, thus having a negative impact
     on the Trust's return.

Q    What is your investment outlook?

A    We believe that the economy is stabilizing. As of May 31, 2009, auto sales,
     consumer confidence and commodity prices were somewhat better than they
     were several months ago. While the unemployment rate and defaults continue
     to rise, we believe that gross domestic product (GDP) could be positive
     over the next several months.

     The market's advance offers evidence that many companies can now obtain
     financing through the bond market, and this could aide in the recovery
     value of loans that are distressed or in bankruptcy. The loan market also
     has shown signs of stabilization as buyers have stepped in to make
     investments. Additionally, liquidity has improved in the bond market, which
     has led to refinancing activity in loans. The lack of any forward-looking
     calendar for loan issuance has created a demand for loan assets, raising
     the potential for price appreciation of existing loans. Also, investors
     have begun buying bank loans as a hedge against inflation. If rising
     inflation continues to be a concern, demand for bank loans is likely to
     increase. Going forward, we will aim to decrease the Trust's positions in
     companies that we feel could default and redeploy the assets into companies
     that we believe have better relative value.

Trust securities.

Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is contained in
the Trust's original offering prospectus. Please refer to this document when
considering the Trust's risks.

6    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09
<PAGE>

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the Trust
will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall the prices of
fixed-income securities in the Trust will generally rise. The floating-rate
feature of the Trust means that the Trust will not experience capital
appreciation in a declining interest-rate environment. Investments in the Trust
are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers of
underlying securities and their inability to meet their debt obligations.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value "NAV", due to such factors as
interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are
sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices
lower than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total
liabilities, which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of common
shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher than market
price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.

Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CS Leveraged Loan Index is a
representative index of tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated
loans. The index began in January 1992. Index returns are calculated monthly,
assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any
fees, expenses or sales charges. The index is not leveraged. You cannot invest
directly in an index.

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The investment objective
of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a
secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent
with its primary objective of high current income.

The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a
developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency
exchange restrictions.

Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
original offering prospectus with additional information included in the
Trust's shareowner reports from time to time. Please refer to those documents
when considering the Trust's investment risks. At times, the Trust's
investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated
or have common risks, making it more susceptible to any economic, political, or
regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries and sectors.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, investment grade fixed-income debt securities and
high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below
investment grade securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly
referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These securities involve
greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less
liquid, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities
may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Trust
believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more
volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more
difficult to value and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.


               Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09     35
<PAGE>

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those generally accepted in the investment company industry:


A. Security Valuation

   Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Investments in Senior
   Loans are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of
   Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one
   or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For
   Senior Loans for which no reliable price quotes are available, such
   investments will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
   pricing matrices to determine valuations.

   Fixed-income securities are valued at prices supplied by independent pricing
   services, which consider such factors as Treasury spreads, yields, maturities
   and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by values obtained from dealers
   and other sources, as required. Equity securities are valued at the last sale
   price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Securities or loans
   for which market prices and/or quotations are not readily available are
   valued using fair values methods pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board
   of Trustees ("board determined"). Trading in foreign securities is
   substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of the
   NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the net asset value of
   the Trust's shares are determined as of such times. The Trust may also use
   the fair value methods to value a security, including a non-U.S. security,
   when the closing market price on the primary exchange where the security is
   traded no longer accurately reflects the value of the security as of the
   close of the NYSE. At May 31, 2009, seven securities have been board
   determined, which represents 1.3% of net assets. Temporary cash investments
   are valued at cost which approximates market value.

   Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
   dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed
   are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend data in
   the exercise of reasonable diligence. Discounts and premiums on debt
   securities are accreted or amortized, respectively, daily, on an effective
   yield to maturity basis and are included in interest income. Premiums and
   discounts related to certain mortgage-backed securities are amortized or


36    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09
<PAGE>

   accreted in proportion to the monthly paydowns. Interest income, including
   income on interest bearing cash accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis.

   Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
   cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.


B. Foreign Currency Translation

   The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
   denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
   current exchange rates.

   Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
   represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
   currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
   between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
   Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
   investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
   effects of changes in market prices of those securities but are included with
   the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.


C. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

   The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
   the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
   future date as a hedge or cross-hedge against either specific investment
   transactions (settlement hedges) or portfolio positions (portfolio hedges).
   All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable exchange rates,
   and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the Trust's
   financial statements. The Trust records realized gains and losses at the time
   a portfolio hedge is offset by entry into a closing transaction or
   extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering into
   these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet the
   terms of the contract and from unanticipated movements in the value of
   foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 4).


D. Federal Income Taxes

   It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
   Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
   all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
   shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Tax
   years for the prior three fiscal years remain subject to examination by tax
   authorities.

   The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
   financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal income
   tax rules. Therefore, the sources of the Trust's distributions may be shown
   in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in excess


               Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09     37
<PAGE>

   of net investment income or net realized gain (loss) on investments and
   foreign currency transactions, or as from paid-in capital, depending on the
   type of book/tax differences that may exist.

   The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and preferred
   shareowners will be determined at the end of the fiscal year. Distributions
   during the year ended November 30, 2008 were as follows:

================================================================================
</TABLE>

   The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
   primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
   methods for premiums and discounts on fixed-income securities and book/ tax
   differences in the accrual of income on securities in default.


E. Repurchase Agreements

   With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value of
   the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest is
   required to be at least equal to or in excess of the value of the repurchase
   agreement. The collateral for all repurchase agreements is held in
   safekeeping in the customer-only account of the Trust's custodian or sub
   custodians. The Trust's investment adviser, Pioneer Investment Management,
   Inc. (PIM), is responsible for determining that the value of the collateral
   remains at least equal to the repurchase price.


F. Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

   All common shareowners automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend
   Reinvestment Plan (the Plan), under which participants receive all dividends
   and capital gain distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and
   fractional common shares of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect
   not to participate in the Plan. Shareowners not participating in the


38    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09
<PAGE>

   Plan receive all dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.
   Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
   resumed at any time without penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer &
   Trust Company, the agent for shareowners in administering the Plan (the Plan
   Agent), in writing prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such
   termination or resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently
   declared dividend or other distribution.

   Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
   participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
   acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued
   but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
   outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on
   the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common share is
   equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
   trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount
   in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common shares to be
   credited to each account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of
   the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the date the shares
   are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then current market
   price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the
   payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share is
   greater than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent will invest
   the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market purchases. There
   are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued common shares. However,
   each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
   with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the
   Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes
   which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding
   Plan shares in a brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to
   another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.


2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit) manages
the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory
Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" is the average daily
value of the Trust's total assets (including any assets attributable to any
leverage that may be outstanding) minus the sum of accrued liabilities (other
than debt representing financial leverage). For the six months ended May 31,
2009, the net management fee was equivalent to 0.70% of the Trust's average
daily managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.33% of the Trust's average
daily net assets attributable to the common shareowners.


               Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09     39
<PAGE>

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At May
31, 2009, $278,920 was payable to PIM related to management costs,
administrative costs and certain other services and is included in "Due to
affiliates" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

PIM has retained Princeton Administrators, LLC (Princeton) to provide certain
administrative and accounting services to the Trust on its behalf. PIM pays
Princeton a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the average daily value
of the Trust's managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily
managed assets in excess of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly fee of
$10,000. Princeton receives no compensation directly from the Trust.

PIM had engaged Highland Capital Management, L.P. to act as the Trust's
investment sub-adviser ("Sub-adviser") and manage the Trust's investments
through December 31, 2008. PIM paid the Sub-adviser a monthly fee at an annual
rate of 0.35% of the average daily value of the Trust managed assets. The fee
was paid monthly in arrears. The Trust did not pay a fee to the Sub-adviser.

Effective January 1, 2009, PIM assumed sole responsibility for management of
the Trust's investments.


3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement
with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all
transfer agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at
negotiated rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) is the
transfer agent, registrar, dividend paying agent and auction agent with respect
to the Trust's Auction Market Preferred Shares (AMPS). The Trust pays Deutsche
Bank an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust and Deutsche
Bank, for providing such services.


4. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver
currencies at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract, the Trust
must make or take delivery of the foreign currency. Alternatively, prior to the
settlement date of a portfolio hedge, the Trust may close out such contracts by
entering into an offsetting hedge contract. At May 31, 2009, the Trust had no
outstanding portfolio hedges or forward currency settlement contracts.

6. Trust Shares

There are an unlimited number of common shares of beneficial interest
authorized.

During the six months ended May 31, 2009 and the year ended November 30, 2008,
there were no share transactions by the Trust. All reinvested distributions
were satisfied with previously issued shares purchased in the open market by
the Plan Agent and credited to shareowner accounts.

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares of beneficial
interest into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As
of May 31, 2009 there were 7,298 AMPS as follows: Series M7-2,434, Series
W7-2,432 and Series TH7-2,432.

On December 8, 2008, the Trust announced the following redemptions of AMPS at a
price of $25,000 per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends through the
redemption date:

</TABLE>

              Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report |  5/31/09     41
<PAGE>

The Trust financed the AMPS redemption with cash.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. An auction fails
if there are more AMPS offered for sale than there are buyers. When an auction
fails, the dividend rate for the period will be the maximum rate on the auction
dates described in the prospectus for the AMPS. Preferred shareowners will not
be able to sell their AMPS at an auction if the auction fails. Since February
2008, the Trust's auctions related to the AMPS have failed. The maximum rate
for each series is the greater of 125% of the one week LIBOR rate or the LIBOR
rate plus a spread of 1.25%. Dividend rates on AMPS ranged from 1.48% to 2.46%
during the six months ended May 31, 2009.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, the Trust does not comply with the asset coverage
ratios described in the prospectus for the AMPS.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Statement of
Preferences are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. Holders of AMPS are also entitled to elect two
of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might otherwise
be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any outstanding
preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to (a) adopt
any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred shares and
(b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders, including, among
other things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.


7. Subsequent Events

Subsequent to May 31, 2009, the Board of Trustees of the Trust declared a
dividend from undistributed net investment income of $0.095 per common share
payable June 30, 2009 to common shareowners of record on June 15, 2009.

Subsequent to May 31, 2009, dividends declared and paid on preferred shares
totaled $244,856 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share series
through July 7, 2009.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (unaudited)

During the period, there were no material changes in the Trust's investment
objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which has not been
approved by the shareowners. There have been no changes in the principle risk
factors associated with investment in the Trust.

Effective January 1, 2009, Jonathan Sharkey of PIM became the portfolio manager
of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its common
shares in the open market.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT POLICIES

EVENT-LINKED BONDS

The Trust may invest in "event-linked" bonds, which sometimes are referred to
as "insurance-linked" or "catastrophe" bonds. Event-linked bonds are debt
obligations for which the return of principal and the payment of interest are
contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a
hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. For some event-linked
bonds, the trigger event's magnitude may be based on losses to a company or
industry, industry indexes or readings of scientific instruments rather than
specified actual losses. If a trigger event, as defined within the terms of an
event-linked bond, involves losses or other metrics exceeding a specific
magnitude in the geographic region and time period specified therein, the Trust
may lose a portion or all of its accrued interest and/or principal invested in
such event-linked bond. The Trust is entitled to receive principal and interest
payments so long as no trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude
specified by the instrument.

Event-linked bonds may be issued by government agencies, insurance companies,
reinsurers, special purpose corporations or other on-shore or off-shore
entities. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked bonds may
also expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
(credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
adverse tax consequences. Event-linked bonds are subject to the risk that the
model used to calculate the probability of a trigger event was not accurate and
underestimated the likelihood of a trigger event. Upon the occurrence or
possible occurrence of a trigger event, and until the completion of the
processing and auditing of applicable loss claims, the Trust's investment in
such event-linked bond may be priced using fair value methods. As a relatively
new type of financial


               Pioneer Floating Rate Trust  | Semiannual Report | 5/31/09     43
<PAGE>

instrument, there is limited trading history for these securities, and there
can be no assurance that a more liquid market in these instruments will
develop.

Event-linked bonds are typically rated by at least one nationally recognized
rating agency, but also may be unrated. The rating for an event-linked bond
primarily reflects the rating agency's calculated probability that a
pre-defined trigger event will occur. This rating also assesses the
event-linked bond's credit risk and model used to calculate the probability of
a trigger event.


CEO CERTIFICATION DISCLOSURE (unaudited)

The Trust's Chief Executive Officer has submitted to the New York Stock
Exchange the annual CEO certification as required by Section 303A.12 (a) of the
NYSE Listed Company Manual. In addition, the Trust has filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission the certification of its Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the
disclosure required by this paragraph.

The registrant's principal executive officer

over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.
