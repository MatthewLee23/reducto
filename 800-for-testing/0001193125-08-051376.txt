Letter to Stockholders

GLOBAL MARKETS REVIEW
    After a volatile summer, and a rebound in August and September as the
Federal Reserve cut U.S. interest rates, stock markets around the world
registered a difficult fourth quarter. Most of the developed markets had
negative fourth quarters, while the strongest emerging markets finished flat
during the same period. The detrimental effect of structured finance linked to
mortgage debt continued to spread throughout most credit products, creating
conditions for the end of the multi-year credit cycle boom.

    Default risk has been reintroduced into the equation, and the need for more
capital for financial intermediaries has become an urgent reality because of
the impairment of assets and the necessity to disclose contingent liabilities
on companies' balance sheets.

SWISS MARKET REVIEW
    As described in previous reports in 2007, the Swiss market has been
affected by issues plaguing the pharmaceuticals industry and investment banks.
In 2007, on the positive side the industrial sector had a very strong
performance (+27.63%), but as it is a relatively small portion of the market,
it had less of an impact on the broad index. In spite of its strong
performance, the industrial sector itself went through a correction towards the
end of the year as economic activity started to show signs of slowdown
worldwide.

    However, the Swiss Performance Index (SPI) was up 7.76% in U.S. dollar
terms compared to 5.49% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. In Swiss francs,
the SPI was flat for the year despite the strong headwinds described above.

    In corporate news, UBS, after announcing the departure of its CEO earlier
in the year, revealed the extent of the damage resulting from its trading in
sub-prime mortgage-backed securities. The bank wrote down 10 billion Swiss
francs and indicated that it had remaining exposure of 29 billion Swiss francs.
At the end of November, the average markdown on various collateralized debt
obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities was 60 cents on the
dollar. Noticeably, UBS had very little exposure to other problematic areas
such as leveraged loans and no exposure to so-called "conduits". However, UBS
has also seen losses generated from its portfolio of structured products.

    UBS also has announced a proposed dilutive capital management program
consisting of the resale of treasury shares, the payment of dividends in stock
rather than cash and a 13 billion Swiss franc issue of mandatory convertible
bonds carrying a 9% coupon that would be closed to current shareholders. The
program, if approved, would bring back the bank's tier one ratio from 8.8% (as
of 12/31/07) to 12.2% (at the high end of the industry standard) which was the
ratio before the sub-prime crisis. Shareholders will have the opportunity to
approve this program at an extraordinary meeting on February 27th. Until then,
any recovery in the

                                      2

Letter to Stockholders (continued)

value of UBS' stock could be delayed by other potential issues including
counterparty risk, the potential for increases in non-performing loans, and
questions about the profitability of the bank's investment banking business
model. These challenges notwithstanding, UBS' equity advisory franchise in the
investment bank and the global private banking franchise should allow
eventually the earnings of the entire company to be on a more normal level.

    While Credit Suisse has much less exposure than UBS to U.S. consumer debt,
it has greater exposure to corporate debt, mainly leveraged loans (commitments
on large private equity transactions) and commercial mortgage-backed
securities. Its third quarter results registered a fair value adjustment of 6.9
billion Swiss francs on these commitments and on other structured products.

    As of September 2007, Credit Suisse's exposure to funded and unfunded
non-investment grade loan commitments stood at 60 billion Swiss francs, much of
it due to large private equity deals. Credit Suisse's relatively small fair
value adjustment in comparison with its total exposure is probably the reason
why it has not outperformed UBS since the crisis started, as investors feared
that additional write downs may be required.

    In the pharmaceutical area, Novartis announced a restructuring program
following the path of some of its European and U.S. peers. The program's goal
is to cut costs, mainly through staff reductions, to an estimated annual
pre-tax level of 1.6 billion U.S. dollars by 2010. A pre-tax restructuring
charge of approximately 450 million U.S. dollars will be taken during the
fourth quarter of 2007. Novartis is looking to decentralize its decision-making
processes and stated that it will focus resources on research and development.

    The outlook for the company will depend on developments in the regulatory
environment and execution of projects in the pipeline. While the company's
valuation mostly reflects those risks, its cardio-vascular franchise and the
growing oncology area will remain the key elements to monitor for a positive
re-rating of the stock.

SWISS ECONOMIC NOTES
    Switzerland recorded stronger than expected growth of 0.8% in the third
quarter (3.2% annualized) mainly as a result of private consumption, which grew
by 0.9% over the previous quarter. This factor continues to be an important
growth driver and is helped by the continuously improving Swiss labor situation
(the unemployment rate finished the year at 2.6%) and rising income. However,
all of the other components of domestic demand had negative quarterly growth
rates. Most importantly, equipment expenditures were down 4.1% from the prior
quarter.

    The export sector continued to be a strong contributor to economic activity
dur-

                                      3

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Letter to Stockholders (continued)

ing the third quarter, increasing by 2.3% over the prior quarter. The growth in
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was 0.8% quarter-on-quarter and 2.3% on a
year-over-year basis. Going forward, the performance of the export sector and
financial intermediaries, (the latter accounting for up to 44% of overall GDP
growth in Switzerland) will continue to be the most important factors to
influence economic activity, as private consumption will continue to be
affected by tightening credit standards.

    Short-term consumption estimates remain positive, however, as the
Purchasing Manager Index (PMI), a forward looking indicator, reported solid
numbers in November at 63.4 (its highest level was 67.7 on 11/30/06) and order
backlog increased to 69.6 (its highest level was 74.5 on 11/30/06).

    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased from 0.4% (year-on-year) to 1.8%
(year-on-year) between August and November. This was principally due to an
increase in the price of oil. Excluding oil, the CPI was contained, increasing
from 0.7% to 0.9%. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has forecasted average
inflation of 0.7% in 2007, 1.7% in 2008 (assuming an increase in the price of
oil in the first half of 2008) and 1.5% in 2009.

    Following last quarter's monetary policy decision to cut interest rates,
the three-month LIBOR rate rapidly dropped from a high of 2.9% to the target
rate of 2.75% and remained at that level. At its last quarterly assessment in
December, the SNB decided to leave its target range for the three-month LIBOR
unchanged at 2.25%-3.25% and hold the rate in the middle of the target range,
(i.e. at 2.75%). The SNB still forecasts a growth rate of a little over 2.5% in
2007 and 2% in 2008.

    On the bond interest rate front, the yield on 10-year Confederation bonds
dropped slightly during the fourth quarter, and finished the year at 3%. Very
short-term government rates (1 year or less) that are influenced more by SNB
policy than by market forces, stayed substantially higher than the rates
ranging from 2 years to 8 years. However, this second portion of the curve
witnessed some steepening that could be related to expectations of higher
inflation.

    Beginning in August, the Swiss franc benefited clearly from an increase in
risk aversion in the market, increasing by 7% against the U.S. dollar and 1%
against the euro, which is a new development. The Swiss franc was, after the
Japanese yen, the strongest performer against the U.S. dollar among all main
currencies. The outlook for the Swiss currency looks quite good based on the
reversal of the carry trade, which benefits the funding currencies like the
Swiss franc and the Japanese yen as interest rate differentials across
different countries are expected to narrow.

OTHER NEWS INVOLVING THE SWISS NATIONAL BANK
    On December 12, 2007, the SNB joined the Bank of Canada, the Bank of
England, the

European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in a coordinated
effort to promote lending and restore liquidity in money markets as inter-bank
spreads reached record levels against government rates. The FRB established a
Temporary Term Auction Facility under which it offered two auctions of 20
billion U.S. dollars each in December. The FRB also established foreign
exchange swap lines with the ECB and the SNB in which they entered with the FRB
to auction 24 billion U.S. dollars to banks in Europe.

RIGHTS OFFERING AND FUND PERFORMANCE
    Since the conclusion of the Fund's rights offering in June, Management has
invested substantially all of the proceeds from the offering in accordance with
the Fund's investment objective and policies. The Fund has made new and
additional investments in certain asset classes, including industrials, small-
and mid-cap issuers and private equity vehicles, where Management has found
attractive investment opportunities. In other sectors, such as real estate,
Management continues to monitor market conditions and investment opportunities.
As previously discussed and anticipated, the rights offering resulted in
dilution to the net asset value of the Fund's shares. This dilution was
estimated at 6.81% (measured in Swiss francs) at the conclusion of the
offering. As of December 31, 2007, the Fund's annual total return based on net
asset value was -2.67% (Swiss francs). Calculated without giving effect to this
dilution, the Fund's annual total return was 4.00% (Swiss francs) as of
December 31, 2007. The SPI's annual total return was -0.05% (Swiss francs) as
of December 31, 2007. As such, Management has been able to reduce the impact of
the rights offering dilution on the Fund's performance relative to the
benchmark. Net of the dilution impact, the relative performance versus the SPI
Index was -2.62% and with the effect of the dilution it was 4.05%.

    The mid cap sector, in which the Fund has made large investments, has been
during the quarter affected by the current economic outlook and redemptions
from investors in European and Swiss mutual funds. However, the main issue for
the Fund was investors' increased risk aversion for the early stage companies
in the biotech sector as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
implemented new measures to improve its review process of new drug candidates.
Under these measures, the FDA will rely more on external experts. Investors
viewed these standards as making the approval process longer and more complex.
The uncertainty created by the discussions around this development has
penalized companies with a high number of products waiting for approval
compared to their existing products on the market.

    The Fund's private equity investments have developed favorably, even though
they have not yet had a material impact on the Fund's performance, as the Fund
has less than 0.5% of its total assets invested in this sector. Management,
however, is gradually increasing its exposure to this sector. There are ample
opportunities in the venture capital and, especially, the buy-out sectors in
Switzerland to

                                      5

Letter to Stockholders (continued)

allow the Fund to make additional investments. The deployment of investments in
these sectors is much longer than required for investments in public equities,
but stays well within the time frame projected.

    As mentioned above, market conditions did not provide the Fund with many
attractive investment opportunities in real estate and infrastructure. The
price correction of listed real estate companies has brought these companies
much closer to their net asset values. Since these companies are mostly active
in commercial real estate, Management will continue to monitor developments in
consumer spending and the local financial sector to assess the sign of a
bottoming process.

OUTLOOK
    Beginning in June, the global market started to discount a projected rapid
slowdown in corporate earnings in 2008-2009. Not only will the progression of
sales numbers be affected by moderation of global economic growth, but also
margins will be under pressure due to the effect of negative operating leverage
and increased input prices. Return on equity also will suffer from lower
earnings and higher capital needs to support business activity, mainly in the
financial sector. As mentioned, however, the valuation of stocks in the Swiss
markets is now at a level that reflects a major slowdown in the U.S. economy
and a more moderate pace of growth outside the United States. While uncertainty
about the impact of the credit crisis on global growth remains, Management will
use the tools at its disposal including private equity and hedging instruments,
to navigate the Fund through the rough environment caused by the unwinding of
the U.S. credit bubble.

Notes to Financial Statements

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. ORGANIZATION
The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment management company. The Fund is organized as a corporation under the
laws of the State of Delaware.

The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term growth of capital
through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies.
The Fund may also acquire and hold equity and equity-linked securities of
non-Swiss companies in limited instances, as fully described in its prospectus.

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES
The Fund values its investments at fair value.

When valuing listed equity securities, the Fund uses the last sale price prior
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity
securities that are not listed or that are listed but have not traded, the Fund
uses the mean between the bid and asked prices for that day.

When valuing fixed income securities, the Fund uses the last bid price prior to
the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. If a current bid price is not
available, the Fund uses the mean between the latest quoted bid and asked
prices. When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the
Fund uses amortized cost.

It is the responsibility of the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board") to
establish fair valuation procedures. When valuing securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that
are available are considered unreliable, the Fund determines a fair value in
good faith in accordance with these procedures. The Fund may use these
procedures to establish the fair value of securities when, for example, a
significant event occurs between the time the market closes and the time the
Fund values its investments. After consideration of various factors, the Fund
may value the securities at their last reported price or at some other value.
As of December 31, 2007, Aravis Venture II and Zurmont Madison Private Equity,
LP are restricted securities priced at fair value as determined by the Board's
Valuation Committee pursuant to the Board's valuation procedures. Listed
warrants with no trading are valued using the bid option price. If no bid
prices are available, then Management uses a theoretical bid price based on the
Black-Scholes model, which is a method of valuing securities by reference to
the value of other securities with similar characteristics such as rating,
interest rate and maturity.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses are determined by comparing the proceeds of a sale or the cost of a
purchase with a specific offsetting transaction.

Dividend income, net of any foreign taxes withheld, is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income, including amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts, is accrued daily. Estimated expenses are also accrued
daily.

The Fund records Swiss withholding tax as a reduction of dividend income, net
of any amount reclaimable from Swiss tax authorities in accordance with the tax
treaty between the United States and Switzerland.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS
The Fund pays dividends at least annually to the extent it has any net
investment income and net realized gains from foreign currency transactions and
makes distributions of any net realized capital gains to the extent they exceed
any capital loss carryforwards. The Fund determines the size and nature of
these distributions in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Distributions may be paid either in cash or in stock with an option to take
cash. The Fund records dividends and distributions on its books on the
ex-dividend date.

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and
to distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Therefore, no federal
income tax provision is required.

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. See Note 5 for Federal income tax treatment of foreign currency
gain/losses.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


F. SECURITIES LENDING INCOME
The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions. The Fund retains
beneficial ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues to receive
amounts equivalent to the dividends paid on these securities and to participate
in any changes in their market value. For the initial transaction, the Fund
requires the borrowers of the securities to establish collateral with the Fund
in the form of cash and/or government securities equal to 105% of the value of
the securities loaned. Subsequent to the initial transaction, the Fund requires
the borrowers to maintain collateral with the Fund equal to 100% of the value
of the securities loaned. The Fund receives fees as compensation for lending
its securities. Either the Fund or the borrower may terminate the securities
loan at any time. There were no securities on loan during the year ended
December 31, 2007.

G. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Fund maintains its accounting records in U.S. dollars. The Fund determines
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and
transactions by using prevailing exchange rates. The cost basis of foreign
denominated assets & liabilities is determined on the date that they are first
recorded within the Fund and translated to U.S. dollars. These assets and
liabilities are subsequently valued each day at prevailing exchange rates. The
difference between the original cost and current value denominated in U.S.
dollars is recorded as Unrealized Currency Gain/Loss. In valuing assets and
liabilities, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the valuation date.
In valuing securities transactions, the receipt of income and the payment of
expenses, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date.

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translations
shown on the Fund's financial statements result from the sale of foreign
currencies, from currency gains or losses realized between the trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions, and from the difference between
the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on
the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually
received or paid.

When calculating realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in
equity securities, the Fund does not separate the gain or loss attributable to
changes in the foreign currency price of the security from the gain or loss
attributable to the change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency.
Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain
(loss) are disclosed separately.

H. ESTIMATES
In preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions. Actual results may be different.

NOTE 2--FEES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Hottinger Capital Corp. ("HCC"), which is owned jointly by Hottinger U.S., Inc.

expenses incurred in connection with publicizing the Fund as follows:

NOTE 3--OTHER FEES

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


On December 28, 2006, Swiss American Securities, Inc. and Credit Suisse First
Boston commenced transition of custody responsibility to Citibank, N.A. (the
"Custodian"); the transfer was completed on January 16, 2007. The Fund pays the
custodian an annual fee.

The Fund pays each director who is not an interested person (as such term is
defined in the Act) of the Fund or its Advisor approximately $30,268 per annum
in compensation, except for the Chairman of the Board to whom the fund pays an
annual fee of approximately $42,568 and for the Chairmen of the Audit Committee
and the Governance/Nominating Committee, to whom the Fund pays an annual fee of
approximately $35,567. In addition, the Fund pays each disinterested director
$1,300 for each Board meeting attended, and pays each disinterested Director
who is a member of a Committee a fee of $750 for each Committee meeting
attended. In connection with the Fund's right offering in 2007, the Board
established an Ad Hoc Rights Offering Committee. The Fund paid each
disinterested director who was a member of that Committee a fee of $1,000 for
each Committee meeting attended. Committee meeting fees are paid for only those
meetings held separately from other meetings. In addition, the Fund reimburses
directors who are not employees of or affiliated with the Advisor for
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in conjunction with attendance at meetings.

Directors' fees and expenses payable of $97,010 shown on the Statements of
Assets and Liabilities represents total dollars owed to Directors that have
been accrued and not paid. Directors' fees and expenses of $595,445 shown on
the Statement of Operations represent the portion of Directors' fees and
expenses accrued during the period January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007.
These fees are calculated by projecting Directors' fees contractually owed and
adding estimates of reimbursable expenses based on historical activity.

NOTE 4--CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS
The Fund is authorized to issue up to 50 million shares of capital stock. HCC
owned 189,187 of the 32,156,607 shares outstanding on December 31, 2007.

NOTE 5--FEDERAL INCOME TAX AND INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
At December 31, 2007, accumulated net investment income and accumulated net
realized gain from investments and foreign currency transactions have been

NOTE 6--STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market purchases of
its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") in 1999 and has
continued purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock
repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net
asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect upon the
Fund's expense ratio. The Board had authorized the Fund to repurchase up to
500,000 shares during 2007. During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Fund
repurchased and retired 390,600 shares at an average price of $17.42 per share
(including brokerage commissions) and a weighted average discount of 13.05%.
These repurchases, which had a total cost of $6,803,424, resulted in an
increase of $1,053,757 to the Fund's net asset value. This gain is the result
of the difference between the Fund's net asset value and the activity price of
the buyback.

NOTE 7--LINE OF CREDIT
On December 13, 2006, the Fund entered into a line of credit arrangement with
the custodian to be used for temporary purposes. The initial agreement expired
on December 13, 2007 and, based on the Fund's request, was renewed until
December 13, 2008. The agreement provides that the Fund may borrow up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed $45,000,000 at any one time outstanding. The
Fund pays interest on the unpaid principal amount of each advance made to it
from the day of such advance until such principal amount is paid in full. The
interest is payable in arrears on demand, or if no demand has been made, on the
last day of the interest period for such advance, pursuant to the agreement.

As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had no loans outstanding under the line of
credit. During the year ended December 31, 2007 the average borrowing was 17.2
million (Swiss Francs) and the average interest rate was 3.25%.

Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48
prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet in
connection with accounting for uncertainties in income tax positions taken or
expected to be taken by an entity, including investment companies, before being
measured and recognized in the financial statements. Management has evaluated
the application of FIN 48 to the Fund, and has determined that the adoption of
FIN 48 does not have a material impact on the Fund's financial statements. The
Fund files U.S. federal, Delaware state and foreign tax returns. No income tax
returns are currently under examination. The Fund's U.S. federal tax returns
remain open for examination for the years ended December 31, 2004 through
December 31, 2007. The Fund's Delaware state tax returns remain open for
examination for the years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2007. In
addition, the Fund holds investments in Switzerland and other foreign tax
jurisdictions that remain open subject to examination based on varying statutes
of limitations.

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")

Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)

157, Fair Value Measurements, which clarifies the definition of fair value and
requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to
measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to
initial recognition. Adoption of SFAS 157 requires the use of the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. SFAS
157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Although still in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, upon adoption
of the standard, management believes there will be no material impact other
than enhanced disclosures.

NOTE 10--PRIVATE EQUITY COMMITMENTS
As of December 31, 2007, the Fund invested in private equity funds. The Fund's

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc.

   We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of The
Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the schedule of investments,
as of December 31, 2007, and the related statement of operations for the year
then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years
in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five
years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. The Fund is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included
consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2007, by
correspondence with the custodian and portfolio fund managers of the private
equity investments. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Fund as of December 31, 2007, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Code of Ethics
The Board of Directors of the Fund and the Advisor have adopted Codes of Ethics
pursuant to provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Codes"). The
Codes apply to the personal investing activities of various individuals
including directors and officers of the Fund and designated officers, directors
and employees of the Advisor. The provisions of the Codes place restrictions on
individuals who are involved in managing the Fund's portfolio, who help execute
the portfolio manager's decisions or who come into possession of
contemporaneous information concerning the investment activities of the Fund.

   The fundamental principle of the Codes is that the individuals covered by
the Codes have a fiduciary responsibility to the Fund and its stockholders.
They are therefore required at all times to place the interests of the Fund and
the stockholders first and to conduct all personal securities transactions in a
manner so as to avoid any actual or potential conflict of interest or abuse of
their position of trust.

   Portfolio managers and other individuals with knowledge of Fund investment
activities are prohibited from purchasing or selling a security during a
blackout period of 30 calendar days before and after the date on which the Fund
effects a trade in the same or a similar security. They are also prohibited
from engaging in short term trading of Swiss equity or equity linked securities.

Additional Information (Unaudited) (continued)

Additionally, the Fund's portfolio managers are prohibited from participating
in any initial public offering or private placement of Swiss equity and equity
linked securities and other covered individuals must obtain prior clearance
before doing so.

Fund and the Advisor have adopted compliance procedures and have appointed
compliance officers to ensure that all covered individuals comply with the
Codes.

2007.

   The Fund designates 57.61% of its ordinary income dividend distributions for
the qualified dividend rate (QDI) as defined in Section 1(h)(11) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The Fund also designates 73.24% as qualified short-term
capital gain dividends exempt from U.S. tax for foreign shareholders (QSD).

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tax Information For the Year Ended December 31, 2007

The amounts may differ from those elsewhere in this report because of
differences between tax and financial reporting requirements. For Federal
income tax purposes, distributions from short-term capital gains are classified
as ordinary income. The Fund's distributions to stockholders of long- term
capital gains included $12,857,564 in connection with the distribution paid May

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Unaudited)

The Plan
The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers a convenient way for
you to reinvest capital gains distributions and ordinary income dividends,
payable in whole or in part in cash, in additional shares of the Fund.

Some of the Plan features are:

   . Once you enroll in the Plan, all of your future distributions and
     dividends payable in whole or in part in cash will be automatically
     reinvested in Fund shares in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
   . You will receive shares valued at the lower of the Fund's net asset value
     or the Fund's market price as described below. The entire amount of your
     distribution or dividend will be reinvested automatically in additional
     Fund shares. For any balance that is insufficient to purchase full shares
     of the Fund, your account will be credited with fractional shares.
   . Your shares will be held in an account with the Plan agent. You will be
     sent regular statements for your records.
   . You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time.

The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the Plan.

How do I enroll in the Plan?
If you are holding certificates for your shares, contact American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company (AST) at the address shown below. If your shares are
held in a brokerage account, contact your broker. Not all brokerage firms
permit their clients to participate in dividend reinvestment plans such as the
Plan and, even if your brokerage firm does permit participation, you may not be
able to transfer your Plan shares to another broker who does not permit
participation. Your brokerage firm will be able to advise you about its
policies.

How does the Plan work?
The cash portion of any dividends or distributions you receive, payable in
whole or in part in cash, will be reinvested in shares of the Fund. The number
of shares credited to your Plan account as a result of the reinvestment will
depend upon the relationship between the Fund's market price and its net asset
value per share on the record date of the distribution or dividend, as
described below:

   . If the net asset value is greater than the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a discount), AST, as Plan Agent, will buy Fund shares for your
     account on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
     Your dividends or distributions will be reinvested at the average price
     AST pays for those purchases.
   . If the net asset value is equal to the market price (the Fund is trading
     at parity), the Fund will issue for your account new shares at net asset
     value.
   . If the net asset value is less than but within 95% of the market price
     (the Fund is trading at a premium of less than 5%), the Fund will issue
     for your account new shares at net asset value.
   . If the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a premium of 5% or more), the Fund will issue for your account
     new shares at 95% of the market price.

If AST begins to buy Fund shares for your account at a discount to net asset
value but, during the course of the purchases, the Fund's market price
increases to a level above the net asset

value, AST will complete its purchases, even though the result may be that the
average price paid for the purchases exceeds net asset value.

Will the entire amount of my distribution or dividend be reinvested?
The entire amount of your distribution or dividend, payable in cash, will be
reinvested in additional Fund shares. If a balance remains after the purchase
of whole shares, your account will be credited with any fractional shares
(rounded to three decimal places) necessary to complete the reinvestment.

How can I sell my shares?
You can sell any or all of the shares in your Plan account by contacting AST.
AST charges $15 for the transaction plus $.10 per share for this service. You
can also withdraw your shares from your Plan account and sell them through your
broker.

Does participation in the Plan change the tax status of my distributions or
dividends?
No. The distributions and dividends are paid in cash and their taxability is
the same as if you received the cash. It is only after the payment of
distributions and dividends that AST reinvests the cash for your account.

Can I get certificates for the shares in the Plan?
AST will issue certificates for whole shares upon your request. Certificates
for fractional shares will not be issued.

Is there any charge to participate in the Plan?
There is no charge to participate in the Plan. You will, however, pay a pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to AST's open market
purchases of shares for your Plan account.

How can I discontinue my participation in the Plan?
Contact your broker or AST in writing. If your shares are in a Plan account,
AST will send you a certificate for your whole shares and a check for any
fractional shares.

Where can I direct my questions and correspondence?
Contact your broker, or contact AST as follows:

   By mail:
     American Stock Transfer & Trust Company
     PO Box 922
     Wall Street Station
     New York, NY 10269-0560

   Through AST's automated voice response System:

AST will furnish you with a copy of the Terms and Conditions of the Plan
without charge.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

(a) The aggregate fees billed for each of the last two fiscal years (the
"Reporting Periods") for professional services rendered by the Registrant's
principal accountant for the audit of the Registrant's annual financial

in connection with the statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for the
Reporting Periods, were $40,750 in 2006 and $52,656 in 2007.

(b) There were no audit-related fees billed to the Registrant in the Reporting
Periods for assurance and related services rendered by the principal accountant
that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the Registrant's
financial statements and are not reported under paragraph (a) of this Item 4.

There were no fees billed in the Reporting Periods for assurance and related
services rendered by the principal accountant to the Registrant's investment
adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with

(collectively the "investment adviser") which were required to be pre-approved

adviser.

<PAGE>

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

Not Applicable.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Registrant has delegated voting of proxies in respect of portfolio holdings
to its investment adviser, Hottinger Capital Corp. (the "Advisor"), to vote the
Registrant's proxies in accordance with Advisor's proxy voting guidelines and
procedures. The Advisor has adopted proxy voting guidelines (the "Voting
Guidelines") that provide as follows:

     .    The Advisor votes proxies in respect of a client's securities in the
          client's best economic interests and without regard to the interests
          of the Advisor or any other client of the Advisor.

     .    Unless the Advisor's Proxy Voting Committee (the "Committee")
          otherwise determines (and documents the basis for its decision) or as
          otherwise provided below, the Advisor votes proxies in a manner
          consistent with the Voting Guidelines.

     .    To avoid material conflicts of interest, the Advisor applies the
          Voting Guidelines in an objective and consistent manner across client
          accounts. Where a material conflict of interest has been identified
          and the matter is covered by the Voting Guidelines, the Committee
          votes in accordance with the Voting Guidelines. Where a conflict of
          interest has been identified and the matter is not covered by the
          Voting Guidelines, the Advisor will disclose the conflict and the
          Committee's determination of the manner in which to vote to the
          Registrant's Audit Committee.

     .    The Advisor also may determine not to vote proxies in respect of
          securities of any issuer if it determines that it would be in the
          client's overall best interests not to vote.

The Advisor's Voting Guidelines address how it will vote proxies on particular
types of matters such as the election for directors, adoption of option plans
and anti-takeover proposals. For example, the Advisor generally will:

     .    support management in most elections for directors, unless the board
          gives evidence of acting contrary to the best economic interests of
          shareholders;

     .    support option plans, if it believes that they provide for their
          administration by disinterested parties and provide incentive to
          directors, managers and other employees by aligning their economic
          interests with those of the shareholders while limiting the transfer
          of wealth out of the company; and

<PAGE>


     .    oppose anti-takeover proposals unless they are structured in such a
          way that they give shareholders the ultimate decision on any proposal
          or offer.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

PRINCIPAL PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

          As of the date of the filing of this Report on Form N-CSR, Messrs.
Philippe Comby and Rudolf Millisits are primarily responsible for the management
of the Registrant's portfolio.

          Mr. Comby has been a portfolio manager of the Registrant since 1999,
when he joined the Advisor. Mr. Comby is a Vice President of the Registrant and
a Director and Senior Vice President of the Advisor. He also is a Director and
the President of Hottinger U.S., Inc. and the Chief Investment Officer and
Senior Vice President of Hottinger Brothers LLC, each of which is a registered
investment adviser affiliated with the Advisor. Mr. Comby has been affiliated
with the Hottinger Group since 1994, providing portfolio management and client
advisory services. He is a member of the New York Society of Security Analysts,
a member of Global Association of Risk Professionals and a Chartered Financial
Analyst.

          Mr. Millisits has been a portfolio manager of the Registrant since
1994, when he joined the Advisor. Mr. Millisits is the Senior Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer of the Registrant and the Chief Operating Officer,
Executive Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer of the Advisor. He also is
the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hottinger U.S., Inc. and the
President and Chief Financial Officer of Hottinger Brothers, LLC. Mr. Millisits
has been affiliated with the Hottinger Group since 1993, providing portfolio
management and private banking services. Prior to joining the Hottinger Group,
Mr. Millisits was a portfolio manager for private clients for Credit Suisse in
New York and Geneva.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

          The Registrant's portfolio managers manage multiple accounts for a
diverse client base, including private clients and institutions.

          Material Conflicts Related to Management of Similar Accounts. The
          ------------------------------------------------------------
potential for conflicts of interest exist when the Advisor or its affiliates and
the portfolio managers manage other accounts that invest in securities in which
the Registrant may invest or that may pursue a strategy similar to the
Registrant's strategy (collectively, "Similar Accounts"). In addition, the
Registrant, as a registered investment company, is subject to different
regulations than certain of the Similar Accounts, and, consequently, may not be
permitted to engage in all the investment techniques or transactions, or to
engage in such techniques or transactions to the same degree, as the Similar
Accounts.

          Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of a portfolio
manager's management of the Registrant and Similar Accounts. For example,
conflicts of interest may arise with both the aggregation and allocation of
securities transactions and allocation of limited investment opportunities, as
the portfolio manager may be perceived as causing accounts he manages to
participate in an offering to increase his overall allocation of securities in
that offering, or to increase his ability to participate in future offerings by
the same underwriter or issuer. Allocations of bunched trades, particularly
trade orders that were only partially filled due to limited availability, and
allocation of investment opportunities generally, could raise a potential
conflict of interest, as the portfolio manager may have an incentive to allocate
securities that are expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Initial
public offerings, in particular, are frequently of very limited availability.
Additionally, the Registrant's portfolio managers may be perceived to have a
conflict of interest because of the number of Similar Accounts, in addition to
the Registrant, that they are managing. In addition, the Advisor could be viewed
as having a conflict of interest to the extent that the Advisor or its
affiliates and/or the portfolio managers have a materially larger investment in
a Similar Account than their investment in the Registrant.

<PAGE>


          A potential conflict of interest may be perceived to arise if
transactions in one account closely follow related transactions in a different
account, such as when a purchase increases the value of securities previously
purchased by the other account, or when a sale in one account lowers the sale
price received in a sale by a second account.

          Other Accounts Managed by the Portfolio Managers. The chart below
          ------------------------------------------------
includes information regarding the Registrant's portfolio managers, as of
December 31, 2007. Specifically, it shows the number of other portfolios and
assets, including the Registrant, managed by the Registrant's portfolio
managers. Neither portfolio manager manages any accounts with respect to which
the advisory fee is based on this performance of the account.

COMPENSATION FOR THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

          The portfolio managers are generally responsible for managing multiple
types of accounts that may, or may not, invest in securities in which the
Registrant may invest or pursue a strategy similar to one of the Registrant's
strategies.

          During the fiscal period covered by this Report on Form N-CSR, the
Registrant's portfolio managers were compensated by a competitive salary and
bonus structure, which was determined both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Salary and bonus are paid in cash. The portfolio managers are compensated on the
performance of the aggregate group of portfolios they manage rather than for a
specific fund or account. Various factors are considered in the determination of
the portfolio managers' compensation. All of the portfolios managed by the
portfolio managers are comprehensively evaluated to determine each portfolio
manager's positive and consistent performance contribution over time. Further
factors include the amount of assets in the portfolios as well as qualitative
aspects that reinforce the Advisor's investment philosophy.

          Total compensation is generally not fixed, but rather is based on the
following factors: (i) leadership and commitment, (ii) maintenance of current
knowledge and opinions on companies owned in the portfolio; (iii) generation and
development of new investment ideas, including the quality of security analysis
and identification of appreciation catalysts; (iv) ability and willingness to
develop and share ideas; and (v) the performance results of the portfolios
managed by the portfolio managers.

          Variable bonus is based on the portfolio managers' quantitative
performance as measured by their ability to make investment decisions that
contribute to the pre-tax absolute and relative returns of the accounts managed
by the portfolio manager, by comparison to predetermined benchmarks (for the
Registrant, the Swiss Market Index and the Swiss Performance Index) over the
current fiscal year and the longer-term performance (3-, 5- or 10-year, if
applicable), as well as performance relative to peers. The portfolio managers'
bonuses also can be influenced by subjective measurement of the managers'
ability to help others make investment decisions.

OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES OF THE REGISTRANT

          As of December 31, 2007, Mr. Comby and Mr. Millisits owned between
$50,001-$100,000 and over $100,000 of shares of common stock of the Registrant,
respectively.

                          THE SWISS HELVETIA FUND, INC.
                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.   COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This code of ethics (the "Code") for The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") applies to the Fund's Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, or other persons performing similar functions, each of whom
is listed on Exhibit A (the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

     .    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     .    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     .    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     .    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     .    accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
Company Act"), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund. The compliance programs and procedures of the Fund and the Fund's
investment advisor (the "Advisor") are designed to prevent, or identify and
correct, violations of these provisions. The Code does not, and is not intended
to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures.

<PAGE>


     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Advisor of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes that the Covered Officers, in the
ordinary course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Advisor, or for both), will be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Advisor and the
Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the Advisor and is
consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have
been handled ethically.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. Covered Officers should keep in mind that the Code
cannot enumerate every possible scenario. The overarching principle of the Code
is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed
improperly before the interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must:

     .    not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

     .    not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

     .    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     .    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
          requirements and disclosure controls and procedures generally
          applicable to the Fund within his area of responsibility;

     .    each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
          others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within
          or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board members and
          auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations; and

     .    to the extent appropriate within his area of responsibility, each
          Covered Officer should consult with other officers and employees of
          the Fund and the Advisor and take other appropriate steps with the
          goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
          disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files with, or
          submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the
          Fund; and

                                      -2-

<PAGE>


     .    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     .    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon becoming
          a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has
          received, read, and understands the Code;

     .    annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code; and

     .    notify the Audit Committee (the "Committee") promptly if he knows of
          any violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of
          the Code.

     The Audit Committee is responsible for applying the Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret the Code in any particular situation and to grant waivers sought by
any Covered Officer. The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing the Code:

     .    the Committee will take all appropriate action to investigate any
          potential violations reported to it;

     .    if, after such investigation, the Committee believes that no violation
          has occurred, the Committee is not required to take any further
          action;

     .    if the Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it will
          inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider
          appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          appropriate personnel of the Advisor or its board; or a recommendation
          to dismiss the Covered Officer; and

     .    any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required, will
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes
of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies and procedures of the Fund, the Advisor or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to the Code, they are superceded by the Code to the extent that
they overlap or conflict with the provisions of the Code. The Fund's and the
Advisor's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and
the Advisor's additional policies and procedures are separate requirements
applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not part of the Code.

                                      -3-

<PAGE>


VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Except as to Exhibit A, the Code may not be amended except in written form,
which is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Fund's
Board, including a majority of independent Board members.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code will be
considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Fund and its counsel, the Board (or
Committees thereof) and its counsel, and the Advisor.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control
     over financial reporting.

     control over financial reporting; and

     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
     operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
     likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
     summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control
     over financial reporting.
