                            LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Each year at this time we share with you our perspective on the past year. In
addition, we discuss what the new year might hold for the economy, equity
markets in general, and your fund.

This year, as noted on the cover of this report, we are celebrating the 150/th/
anniversary of the incorporation of The Adams Express Company. We have included
with the mailing of this report a brief history of the Company that we hope you
will find of interest. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we will have on
display some items of interest from the Company's past and anticipate including
a restored Adams Express delivery wagon. On July 1, the actual date of
incorporation, we expect to ring the bell to open the session of the New York
Stock Exchange.

The Year in Review
Your fund generated a total return on net asset value of 26.3% for the year,
compared to the 28.7% return of the S&P 500 Index and the 28.3% return of the
Dow Industrials. As can be seen from the Schedule of Investments beginning on
page 13 of this report, the majority of our holdings are in
large-capitalization companies, historically the most conservatively-funded and
stable companies available for investment. As it turned out these were the
poorest-performing stocks in the market in 2003. Our belief is that investors
quickly gravitated to smaller companies as the economy picked up since they
would experience rapid growth sooner.

The year began auspiciously, with a strong market rally following the rather
subdued final weeks of 2002. The optimism did not last long, however, as
preliminary earnings reports for the final quarter of 2002 were released and
companies announced their initial expectations for revenues and earnings for
2003. By
January 15, investors had taken a more serious look at the economic and
political situations in the United States and abroad and began unloading
stocks. The fiscal stimulus package proposed by the Bush Administration seemed
to lack support, which meant that despite very low interest rates the economy
was unlikely to grow vigorously. Conditions in the Middle East appeared to be
deteriorating and war in Iraq became increasingly unavoidable.

By mid-March, the stock market had declined almost steadily to near its low
point of 2002. New corporate scandals were exposed, serving to further reduce
investor confidence. The commencement of military action in Iraq and initial
successes there helped to turn the markets around. By mid-April, with the war
seemingly all but over, the dictator in hiding, and U.S. troops in control of
the country, the market rally was in full swing. Though there were still
concerns about the domestic economy, corporate earnings reports were better
than expected and by the middle of May the stock market recovered to where it
began the year.

The economic outlook improved dramatically with the passage by Congress of a
$350 billion fiscal stimulus package. There was an almost immediate increase in
consumer spending, which in turn stimulated inventory investment by businesses.
Third quarter growth in real gross domestic product amounted to 8.2%, a level
not seen in two decades, and corporate profits grew 30% over the prior year,
the most in 19 years. Stock valuations were reappraised by investors and prices
pushed higher to reflect the better profit picture. The economies of Europe and
Asia also showed improvement as the U. S. dollar slid to new lows against the
euro and other currencies. An improved holiday selling season and the capture
of Saddam Hussein served to keep investor confidence high through the end of
the year and to extend the market rally.

After three down years ending in 2002, in which the dot-com and
telecommunications bubbles burst, the performance of smaller-capitalization and
technology stocks in 2003 was extraordinary. The smallest 100 stocks in the S&P
500 provided returns of more than 60%, two times the returns of the largest 100
stocks in the Index. Technology stocks provided the best sector return for the
year, at 47.2%, while telecom services, with a 7.1% return, had the worst.
Stocks in the materials, consumer discretionary, industrial, and financial
sectors all had returns in excess of 30%, while the health care and consumer
staples sectors had returns of 15.1% and 11.6%, respectively.


A greater surprise in 2003 was the relative performance of non-dividend-paying
stocks in the S&P 500. The fiscal stimulus package passed by Congress included
a provision whereby dividend income would be taxed at the more-favorable
capital gains rate rather than at the ordinary income rate, which should make
dividend-paying stocks more attractive to investors. Yet the 100 stocks in the
Index with the lowest yields or that paid no dividends provided a return of
more than 40% for the year compared to the 27% return of the highest-yielding
stocks. Again, as we have historically placed some emphasis on the generation
of dividend income for our shareholders, this was not beneficial to our returns
for the year.

Despite the weaker relative performance of larger-capitalization and
dividend-paying stocks in general, Adams Express still provided an excellent
26.3% total return for the year. The discount of the market price from the net
asset value per share widened to 13.6% at year-end from 12.8% a year ago,
resulting in a total return on the fund's market price of 25.2%.

Investment Results
At the end of 2003 our net assets were $1,218,862,456 or $14.36 per share on
84,886,412 shares outstanding.

                                                                             3

This compares with $1,024,810,092 or $12.12 per share on 84,536,250 shares
outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2003 was $15,613,355 compared to $16,738,360 for
2002. These earnings are equal to $0.19 and $0.20 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout the year. In 2003, our
0.47% expense ratio (expenses to average net assets) was once again at a very
low level compared to the industry.

Net realized gains amounted to $49,120,443 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments increased from $94,587,538 at December
31, 2002 to $282,112,491 at year end, a 198% increase.

Dividends and Distributions
The total dividends and distributions paid in 2003 were $0.78 per share
compared to $0.76 in 2002. As announced on November 13, 2003, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.05 and capital gains of
$0.58 was made on December 27, 2003, both realized and taxable in 2003. On
January 8, 2004, an additional distribution of $0.05 per share was declared
payable March 1, 2004, representing the balance of undistributed net investment
income and capital gains earned during 2003, all taxable to shareholders in
2004.

Outlook for 2004
Economic information from government and private organizations gives every
indication that the domestic economy will continue to grow at a "higher than
equilibrium" pace for the first two to three quarters of 2004. A growth rate of
approximately 3 1/2% is generally agreed upon as a level that neither increases
nor decreases inflationary pressures and provides a stable employment rate. A
growth rate higher than 3 1/2% is expected to generate some inflationary
pressure and additional jobs, causing a reduction in the unemployment rate. The
Federal Reserve has given indications that it would be unlikely to raise the
federal funds rate (triggering an increase in most short-term interest rates)
unless the inflation rate were to head higher than about 2% or the unemployment
rate to head below 5%. In our opinion, neither of these is likely to occur in
the first nine months of the year, and we do not expect any tightening until
late in the year or early 2005.

There are a number of countervailing forces at play in the economy which could
cause an acceleration in growth or, which we believe is more likely, a
deceleration. Two of these are interrelated, namely high energy prices and the
relatively low value of the dollar compared to other currencies. Should oil
prices continue in the $30-$33 per barrel range, the cost of operations for
many companies will be adversely impacted and earnings will not grow as fast as
expected. Natural gas prices are also currently at a very high level due to
declining domestic production and colder weather in the Northeast. This has an
impact on electricity prices and the energy costs of many processing companies,
both important factors in the economy.

One of the reasons oil prices have stayed as high as they have is the decline
in the value of the U.S. dollar. As worldwide transactions in oil continue to
be priced in dollars, producers outside the United States must charge more
dollars per barrel in order to receive the same value. Goods produced in the
United States could be less expensive overseas, thus stimulating exports from
this country, while higher-priced imports should decline. The net effect on the
current account balance is not likely to be great, but any reduction in the
large negative monthly balance of trade would be beneficial.

Another mounting concern is the size of the expected budget deficit in 2004,
currently put at about $500 billion. This would be the largest absolute amount
and the largest percentage of the gross domestic product that the deficit has
ever been. Government borrowing will be heavy throughout the year in order to
fund this deficit and is likely to cause intermediate and long-term interest
rates to move up. This in turn could deter the financing of capital
expenditures by businesses, dampening economic growth.

On the basis of these expectations, we believe growth in 2004 will be between
3 1/2% and 4%, a level which will not strain any sectors while producing good
profits. In our opinion, though, this outlook is already well-reflected in the
valuations of many companies. With the market indices currently trading at
about 19 times expected 2004 earnings, there is not much room for earnings
disappointments, market scandals, terrorist acts, or new political turmoil
overseas. As indicated, we do not expect action from the Fed sooner than late
2004, so that should not be a factor. Over the course of the year, we would
expect that investors would gradually rotate out of the most cyclical sectors
of the economy and look for less cyclical and late-cycle stocks that would not
be seriously impacted by rate increases anticipated in 2005.

The Adams Express portfolio, as can be seen from the chart on page 1 of this
report, is well-balanced among important industry sectors, and we have elected
to place more or less weight on several sectors than the S&P 500. The level of
cash and short-term investments, at 3.9% of net assets, is down substantially
from the 15.8% at year-end 2002, as a large number of new investment ideas have
been generated by our research staff. This is more a function of our
conservative, long-term outlook than an effort to time economic cycles. The
portfolio, as currently structured, should perform solidly regardless of where
in the cycle we might be.

Corporate Governance
There has been a great deal of attention recently paid to illegal and unethical
activities in the mutual fund industry. We feel it is important to remind our
shareholders that we condemn the activities that have been uncovered and assure
you that we have not engaged in them. Since your fund's shares are publicly
traded, trading arrangements that benefit some shareholders over others are not
possible. Thus, should they wish to do so, all of our shareholders are able to
make after-hours trades, to engage in rapid trading of our shares, and to
attempt to time trades, and no shareholders are given special privileges in
this regard. While we maintain relationships with many brokerage houses and
encourage them to recommend Adams Express as an investment, we do not make
"soft dollar" payments to brokers for this purpose. All commissions paid on
buying or selling stocks for the portfolio are reviewed by the Board of
Directors quarterly. Our use of commission dollars to pay for important
research to better enable our analysts to make their stock selections is
conducted in strict accordance with applicable SEC rules.

Two new Directors were elected to the Board, effective November 13, 2003,
bringing the total number to thirteen. Ms. Phyllis O. Bonanno, President of
International Trade Solutions, Inc., brings wide experience in global trade to
the Board, while Ms. Kathleen T. McGahran, Principal and Director of Pelham
Associates, adds a wealth of specialized knowledge in accounting to our range
of skills. All of the Directors except Mr. Ober qualify as independent
directors by SEC definition, and thus more than 90% of the Board consists of
directors who are independent of management. In addition to monthly meetings of
the full Board of Directors, the independent Directors meet separately every
other month.

Share Repurchase Program
On December 11, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company over
the ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the same restriction as
in the past, namely that shares can only be repurchased as long as the discount
of the market price of the shares from the net asset value is 10% or greater.

From the beginning of 2004 through February 12, 2004, a total of 256,900 shares
have been repurchased at a total cost of $3,287,032 and a weighted average
discount from net asset value of 12.6%.

                                  ----------

The proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in
Baltimore, Maryland on March 30, 2004, will be mailed on or about February 20,
2004 to holders of record on February 13, 2004.

By order of the Board of Directors,

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Adams Express Company (the Company) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a diversified investment company. The Company's
investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its investment
transactions are set forth in the Company's registration statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on a national security
exchange are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Affiliated Companies -- Investments in companies 5% or more of whose
outstanding voting securities are held by the Company are defined as
"Affiliated Companies" in Section 2(a)(3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Security Transactions and Investment Income --Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. Federal Income Taxes

The Company's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities, including options, at December 31, 2003 was $1,053,762,311, and net
unrealized appreciation aggregated $282,599,742, of which the related gross
unrealized appreciation and depreciation were $420,203,272 and $137,603,530,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the tax basis of distributable earnings
was $3,031,867 of undistributed ordinary income and $313,583 of undistributed
long-term capital gain.

The Company has an employee incentive stock option and stock appreciation
rights plan which provides for the issuance of options and stock appreciation
rights for the purchase of up to 2,610,146 shares of the Company's Common Stock
at 100% of the fair market value at date of grant. Options are exercisable
beginning not less than one year after the date of grant and extend and vest
over ten years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant and
extend over the period during which the option is exercisable. The stock
appreciation rights allow the optionees to surrender their rights to exercise
their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the difference
between the option price and the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of surrender.

Under the plan, the exercise price of the options and related stock
appreciation rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gain paid by
the Company during subsequent years. At the beginning of 2003, there were
259,023 options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $11.19
per share. During 2003, the Company granted options, including stock
appreciation rights, for 57,398 shares of common stock with a weighted average
exercise price of $10.98 per share. During the year, stock appreciation rights
relating to 43,438 stock option shares were exercised at a weighted average
market price of $11.75 per share and the stock options relating to these rights
which had a weighted average exercise price of $3.02 per share were cancelled.
In addition, stock options and stock appreciation rights relating to 43,619
shares, and having a weighted average exercise price of $11.16, were cancelled.
At December 31, 2003, there were outstanding exercisable options to purchase
77,111 common shares at $10.25-$18.43 per share (weighted average price of
$14.40), and unexercisable options to purchase 152,253 common shares at
$3.81-$18.43 per share (weighted average price of $10.89). The weighted average
remaining contractual life of outstanding exercisable and unexercisable options
was 6.85 years and 6.47 years, respectively. Total compensation expense
recognized in 2003 related to the stock option and stock appreciation rights
plan was $131,219. At December 31, 2003, there were 1,242,752 shares available

5. Retirement Plans

The Company provides retirement benefits for its employees under a
non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based
on years of service and compensation during the last five years of employment.
The Company's current funding policy is to contribute annually to the plan only
those amounts that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. As of
December 31, 2003, the plan assets consisted of investments in Company stock
(6%), other individual stocks (60%), and mutual funds (34%).

The actuarially computed net pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2003
was $481,724, and consisted of service expense of $197,602, interest expense of
$386,493, expected return on plan assets of $720,212, net amortization expense
of $356,955, and loss on settlement of $260,886, due to lump-sum distributions.

In determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation,
the interest rate used for the weighted average discount rate was 6.75%, the
expected rate of annual salary increases was 7.0%, and the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets was 8.0%.

On January 1, 2003, the projected benefit obligation for service rendered to
date was $6,250,515. During 2003, the projected benefit obligation increased
due to service cost and interest cost of $197,602 and $386,493 respectively,
and decreased due to benefits paid in the amount of $237,896 and the effect of
a settlement of $555,874. The projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2003
was $6,040,840.

On January 1, 2003, the fair value of plan assets was $9,649,491. During 2003,
the fair value of plan assets increased due to the expected return on plan
assets of $720,212 and decreased due to benefits paid in the amount of $237,896
and the effect of a settlement of $703,849. At December 31, 2003, the fair
value of plan assets amounted to $9,427,958, which resulted in excess plan
assets of $3,387,118. The remaining components of prepaid pension cost on
December 31, 2003 included $1,972,643 in unrecognized loss and $397,284 in
unrecognized prior service cost. Prepaid pension cost included in other assets

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Adams Express Company:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Adams Express Company
(hereafter referred to as the "Company") at December 31, 2003, and the results
of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights
for each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                     SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


WE ARE OFTEN ASKED --

How do I invest in Adams Express?

Adams Express Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the
Pacific Exchange. The stock's ticker symbol is "ADX" and may be bought and sold
through registered investment security dealers. Your broker will be able to
assist you in this regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our
transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan
(see page 21).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.adamsexpress.com. The daily NAV is also
available on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XADEX.
The week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers and on
Mondays in The Wall Street Journal in a table titled "Closed-End Funds." The
table compares the net asset value at the close of the week's last business day
to the market price of the shares, and shows the amount of the discount or
premium.

Adams Express daily trading is shown in the stock tables of most daily
newspapers, usually with the abbreviated form "AdaEx." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Company at (800)
638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Adams Express stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept
in a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your dividend and capital gain
distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American Stock
Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided on page
21.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Adams
Express?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc. as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Adams Express is simple and is handled through our transfer
agent. The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of
transfer. They will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the
transfer agent stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer
agent will send you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your
transfer.

Item 2. Code of Ethics.

On  June 12, 2003, the Board of Directors adopted a code  of
ethics  that  applies  to registrants  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer. The code of  ethics
is     available     on     registrants     website     at:
www.adamsexpress.com. Since the code of ethics  was  adopted
there  have  been no amendments to it nor have  any  waivers
from any of its provisions been granted.


Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The  board of directors has determined that at least one  of
the  members  of  registrants  audit  committee  meets  the
definition  of  audit committee financial expert  as  that
term  is  defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The  two directors on the registrants audit committee  whom
the  board of directors has determined meet such definition
are  Enrique R. Arzac and Kathleen T. McGahran, both of whom
are independent pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this Item.

Item 4. Principal Accountant Fees and Services.

  (a)  Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed for professional
     services   rendered   by   its  independent   auditors,
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for the audits of the Companys
     annual and semi-annual financial statements for 2003 and
     2002 were $54,007 and $40,596, respectively.

  (b)  Audit Related Fees. There were no audit-related fees in
     2003 and 2002.

  (c)  Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed to registrant for
     professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
     for the review of registrants excise tax calculations and
     preparations of federal, state and excise tax returns for
     2003 and 2002 were $8,255 and $8,012, respectively.

  (d)  All Other Fees. The aggregate fees billed to registrant
     by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP other than for the services
     referenced above for 2003 was $0 and for 2002 was $2,250,
     which related to tax research for option purchasing.

  (e)   (1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy. As of 2003,
     all   services  to  be  performed  for  registrant   by
     PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP must be pre-approved by the audit
     committee. All services performed in 2003 were pre-approved
     by the committee.

  (2) Not applicable.

  (f)  Not applicable.

  (g)  The aggregate fees billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
     for non-audit professional services rendered to registrant
     for 2003 and 2002 were $8,255 and $10,262, respectively.

  (h)   The Registrants audit committee has considered  the
     provision by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of the non-audit
     services described above and found that they are compatible
     with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPs independence.


Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants.

       established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the

Item 6. [Reserved by SEC for future use].

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and  Procedures
     for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES & PROCEDURES

The  Adams  Express  Company (Adams)  follows  long-standing
general  guidelines  for  the voting  of  portfolio  company
proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility to  vote
all   such  proxies.  The  portfolio  company  proxies   are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Adams uses its
own  staff  of research analysts and portfolio managers.  In
making  the  decision  to  invest  in  a  company  for   the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyzes  is
the integrity and competency of the companys management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of the  companys
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio companys management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations of the companys management.   When  we
believe that the managements recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   managements
recommendation are:

Stock Options
Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the companys overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the companys stock.

Corporate Control/ Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a staggered board of directors. Staggered boards are used to
help  create a roadblock to a possible takeover of a company
or   to   entrench  incumbent  management  and   board.   In
conformance  with  that policy, we will  generally  vote  in
favor  of  shareholder proposals to eliminate the  staggered
election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a companys
charter   that   can   be  characterized  as   anti-takeover
provisions.  For  example, we generally  vote  in  favor  of
stockholder  proposals to rescind or require  a  stockholder
vote on anti-takeover provisions such as poison pills  and
the like.

With  respect  to  so-called golden parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within the authority of the companys management, under  the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually are persuaded managements  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance  with   managements
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Item   8.  Purchases  of  Equity  Securities  by  Closed-End
Management Investment Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

Form  N-CSR  disclosure requirement not yet  effective  with
respect to registrant.

Item 9. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Form  N-CSR  disclosure requirement not yet  effective  with
respect to registrant.

Item 10. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 26, 2004, an evaluation was performed
     under the supervision and with the participation of the
     officers of registrant, including the principal executive
     officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of
     the effectiveness of registrants disclosure controls and
     procedures.  Based on that evaluation, the registrants
     officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that, as of
     February 26, 2004, the registrants disclosure controls and
     procedures were reasonably designed so as to ensure that
     material information relating to the registrant is made
     known to the PEO and PFO.

  (b)   There  have  been  no  significant  changes  in  the
     registrants internal control over financial reporting (as
     defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
     1940  (17  CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred  during  the
     registrants last fiscal half-year that has  materially
     affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
     registrants internal control over financial reporting.

Item 11. Exhibits.

     (a)(1)  As  indicated in Item 2, the code of ethics  is
posted on the registrants website.

      (2) The certifications of the PEO and PFO pursuant  to
Rule  30a-2(a) under the Investment Company Act of 1940  are
attached hereto as Exhibit 99 CERT.

  (c)  The certifications of the PEO and PFO pursuant to Rule
     30a-2(b)  under the Investment Company Act of 1940  are
     attached hereto as Exhibit 99.906 CERT.
