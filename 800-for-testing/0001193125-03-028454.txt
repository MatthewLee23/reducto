Dear Shareholder,

The philosopher Bertrand Russell famously remarked that, "Change is one thing,
progress is another." You will notice in the following pages that we have begun
to implement some changes to your shareholder report and we will be reflecting
other changes in future reports. Our aim is to make meaningful improvements in
reporting on the management of your Fund and its performance, not just to enact
change for change's sake. Please bear with us during this transition period.

We know that you have questions about fund managers' decisions and plans, and
we want to be sure that you have easy access to the information you need.
Keeping investors informed is, and always will be, one of my top priorities as
Chairman of your Fund. To that end, we encourage you to contact Investor
Relations at 1-888-735-6507.

As always, thank you for entrusting your assets to us. We look forward to
helping you continue to meet your financial goals. Please read on to learn more
about your Fund's performance and the Manager's strategy.

Sincerely,

Performance Review

During the 12 months ended May 31, 2003, the Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc.
("Fund") distributed income dividends to common stock shareholders totaling
$0.66 per common share. The table below shows the annualized distribution
yields and 12-month total returns based on the Fund's May 31, 2003 net asset
value ("NAV") per common share and its New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") closing
price./i/ Certain investors may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum
Tax, and state and local taxes may apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully
taxable. Please consult your personal tax adviser. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.
During the period we reduced the Fund's duration (its sensitivity to interest
rate movements). Although no one can say for sure where interest rates are
headed, considering that interest rates are hovering at historic lows, we
reduced the Fund's duration to position the portfolio for a possible rise in
interest rates. While this strategy hampered the Fund's short-term performance,
our goal has been to prudently position the Fund for the long term.

Market Review

Municipal bonds collectively generated strong results over the reporting
period, although the market vacillated throughout the year due to swings in
investor sentiment. When the period began, concerns about the health of the
economy and corporate accounting practices prompted many investors to shift
money from riskier assets into higher-rated fixed-income securities,
specifically U.S. Treasuries, as well as into investment-grade municipal bonds.
Bonds lost a little ground to equities when the Fed cut short-term interest
rates last November to their lowest levels in over 40 years. However, as
concerns


                                   [GRAPHIC]

regarding the prospects of war in Iraq and the U.S. economy became more
pronounced, many investors again shifted assets into higher-rated debt issues.
Over the last 12 months, the total return of the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index/iv/was 10.36%.

Our Approach to Securities Selection

The recession and stock market's retreat last year negatively impacted the tax
collections of many municipalities, so we remained particularly attentive to
diligently evaluating investment candidates on a risk/reward basis. Given the
relatively lower yields offered by higher-rated state-backed general obligation
bonds during the period, the Fund maintained significant exposure to essential
services revenue bonds, such as those in the water-and-sewer sectors. (Revenue
bonds are supported directly by the operating revenues of the projects of their
issuers.) The Fund was concentrated primarily in the transportation, hospital
(which offered relatively higher tax-exempt yields than many other sectors) and
education industries. Rather than target specific sectors, however, the Fund
invested in issues that appeared competitively priced to us in a broad range of
sectors.

We reduced the Fund's duration by targeting issues with higher coupons, which
is the fixed rate that the issuer promises to pay the bondholder until
maturity, and selling bonds with lower coupons. Furthermore, we continued to
use U.S. Treasury futures to help hedge the Fund to an extent against the
possibility of rising rates. While this strategy detracted from the Fund's
returns, we opted to pursue this more conservative course in terms of managing
interest rate risk while seeking bonds that offered reasonable levels of
tax-exempt income.

The Fund's focus on high-quality, investment-grade issues is also indicative of
our conservative approach. As of the period's close, over half of the Fund was
invested in issues rated AAA by Standard and Poor's Ratings Service or Aaa by
Moody's Investors Service, and over 94% of the Fund was invested in issues
rated A or better.

The information provided in this letter by the Manager is not intended to be a
forecast of future events, a guarantee of future results or investment advice.
Views expressed may differ from those of the firm as a whole.

change. Please refer to pages 7 through 19 for a list and percentage breakdown
of the Fund's holdings.

/i/     NAV is a price that reflects the value of the Fund's underlying
        portfolio. However, the price at which an investor may buy or sell
        common shares of the Fund is the Fund's market price as determined by
        supply of and demand for the Fund's common shares.
/ii/    Total returns are based on changes in NAV or the market price,
        respectively. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all dividends
        and/or capital gains distributions in additional common shares.
        Annualized distribution yield is the Fund's current monthly income
        dividend rate, annualized, and then divided by the NAV or the market
        price noted in this report. The annualized distribution yield assumes a
        current monthly income dividend rate of $0.058 for 12 months. This rate
        is as of May 31, 2003 and is subject to change.
/iii/   The Fund issued $250 million in municipal Auction Rate Cumulative
        Preferred Stock on May 22, 2002. This offering enabled the Fund to
        invest proceeds of the offering into additional securities that met the
        Fund's objectives. In general, leveraging techniques (such as this) may
        be beneficial in periods when interest rates are declining and
        short-term rates are substantially lower than intermediate- and
        long-term rates, as leveraging potentially tends to enhance both net
        asset value and yield. In periods of rising interest rates, however, the
        opposite typically happens: drops in per share net asset value are
        magnified, as falling prices on the increased asset base are spread over
        the same amount of common shares outstanding. Additionally, in this
        latter scenario, the yield advantage diminishes as short-term rates rise
        closer to the yields of the Fund's longer-term holdings.
/iv/    The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is a broad measure of the
        municipal bond market with maturities of at least one year. Please note
        that an investor cannot invest directly in an index.

Take Advantage of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan!
As an investor in the Fund, you can participate in its Dividend Reinvestment
Plan ("Plan"), a convenient, simple and efficient way to reinvest your
dividends and capital gains, if any, in additional shares of the Fund. Below is
a short summary of how the Plan works.

Plan Summary
If you are a Plan participant who has not elected to receive your dividends in
the form of a cash payment, then your dividend and capital gain distributions
will be reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Fund.

The number of shares of common stock in the Fund you will receive in lieu of a
cash dividend is determined in the following manner. If the market price of the
common stock is equal to or exceeds 98% of the net asset value per share
("NAV") on the determination date, you will be issued shares by the Fund at a
price reflecting the NAV, or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.

If the market price is less than 98% of the NAV at the time of valuation (the
close of business on the determination date), PFPC Global Fund Services ("Plan
Agent"), will buy common stock for your account in the open market.

If the Plan Agent begins to purchase additional shares in the open market and
the market price of the shares subsequently rises above the previously
determined NAV before the purchases are completed, the Plan Agent will attempt
to terminate purchases and have the Fund issue the remaining dividend or
distribution in shares at the greater of the previously determined NAV or 95%
of the market price. In that case, the number of Fund shares you receive will
be based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the
open market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares.

A more complete description of the current Plan appears in this report
beginning on page 39.

To find more detailed information about the Plan and about how you can
participate, please call PFPC Global Fund Services at (800) 331-1710.

                                 BOND RATINGS
                                  (unaudited)



The definitions of the applicable rating symbols are set forth below:

Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("Standard & Poor's") -- Ratings from "AA" to
"CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show
relative standings within the major rating categories.

<TABLE>
<C>    <S>
AAA    --Bonds rated "AAA" have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
         Poor's. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely
         strong.
AA     --Bonds rated "AA" have a very strong capacity to pay interest and
         repay principal and differ from the highest rated issue only in a
         small degree.
A      --Bonds rated "A" have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
         principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the
         adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions
         than debt in higher rated categories.
BBB    --Bonds rated "BBB" are regarded as having an adequate capacity to
         pay interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit
         adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or
         changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
         capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this
         category than in higher rated categories.
BB, B, --Bonds rated "BB", "B", "CCC" and "CC" are regarded, on balance, as
CCC      predominantly speculative and with respect to capacity to pay
and CC   interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the
         obligation. "BB" represents a lower degree of speculation than "B",
         and "CC" the highest degree of speculation. While such bonds will
         likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these are
         outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to
         adverse conditions.

Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") -- Numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 may
be applied to eachgeneric rating from "Aa" to "Ba," where 1 is the highest
and 3 the lowest ranking within itsgeneric category.
Aaa    --Bonds rated "Aaa" are judged to be of the best quality. They carry
         the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred
         to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by
         an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the
         various protective elements are likely to change, such changes as
         can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally
         strong position of such issues.
Aa     --Bonds rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
         Together with the "Aaa" group they comprise what are generally
         known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds
         because margins of protection may not be as large in "Aaa"
         securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater
         amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the
         long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in "Aaa" securities.
A      --Bonds rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes and
         are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors
         giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate
         but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to
         impairment some time in the future.
Baa    --Bonds rated "Baa" are considered as medium grade obligations, i.e.,
         they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest
         payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but
         certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
         characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such
         bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have
         speculative characteristics as well.
Ba     --Bonds rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their
         future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection
         of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby
         not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the
         future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class.

NR     --Indicates that the bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's or
         Moody's.

<TABLE>
<C>    <S>
SP-1   --Standard & Poor's highest rating indicating very strong or strong
         capacity to pay principal and interest; those issues determined to
         possess overwhelming safety characteristics are denoted with a plus
         (+) sign.
A-1    --Standard & Poor's highest commercial paper and variable-rate demand
         obligation (VRDO) rating indicating that the degree of safety
         regarding timely payment is either overwhelming or very strong;
         those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety
         characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign.
VMIG 1 --Moody's highest rating for issues having a demand feature -- VRDO.
P-1    --Moody's highest rating for commercial paper and for VRDO prior to
         the advent of the VMIG 1 rating.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

   1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc. ("Fund"), a Maryland corporation, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.

   The significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund are:
(a) security transactions are accounted for on trade date; (b) securities are
valued at the mean between bid and asked prices provided by an independent
pricing service that are based on transactions in municipal obligations,
quotations from municipal bond dealers, market transactions in comparable
securities and various relationships between securities; (c) securities
maturing within 60 days or less are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or
minus amortized premium, which approximates value; (d) gains or losses on sale
of securities are calculated by using the specific identification method; (e)
interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of
discount, is recorded on an accrual basis; (f) dividends and distributions to
shareholders are recorded monthly by the Fund on the ex-dividend date for the
shareholders of Common Stock. The holders of the Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends in accordance with an
auction that will normally be held weekly and out of funds legally available to
shareholders; (g) the net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock is determined
no less frequently than the close of business on the Fund's last business day
of each week (generally Friday). It is determined by dividing the value of the
net assets available to Common Stock by the total number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. For the purpose of determining the net asset value per share
of the Common Stock, the value of the Fund's net assets shall be deemed to
equal the value of the Fund's assets less (1) the Fund's liabilities, (2) the
aggregate liquidation value (i.e., $25,000 per outstanding share) of the
Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock and (3) accumulated and unpaid
dividends on the outstanding Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock issue; (h)
the Fund intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pertaining to regulated investment companies
and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from
substantially all Federal income and excise taxes; (i) the character of income
and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. At May 31, 2003, reclassifications were made to
the Fund's capital accounts to reflect permanent book/tax differences and
income and gains available for distributions under income tax regulations; and
(j) estimates and assumptions are required to be made regarding assets,
liabilities and changes in net assets resulting from operations when financial
statements are prepared. Changes in the economic

                                  (continued)


environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining
these estimates could cause actual results to differ.

   2. EXEMPT-INTEREST DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

   The Fund intends to satisfy conditions that will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular Federal income tax and from
designated state income taxes, to retain such tax-exempt status when
distributed to the shareholders of the Fund.

   Capital gain distributions, if any, are taxable to shareholders, and are
declared and paid at least annually.

   3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT AND OTHER
      TRANSACTIONS

   Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("SBFM"), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment adviser to the
Fund. The Fund pays SBFM a fee calculated at an annual rate of 0.70% of the
average daily total net assets of the Fund. For purposes of calculating this
fee, the liquidation value of any outstanding preferred stock of the Fund is
included in determining the Fund's average daily total net assets. This fee is
calculated daily and paid monthly. SBFM also acts as the Fund's administrator
for which the Fund pays a fee calculated at an annual rate of 0.20% of the
average daily total net assets. This fee is calculated daily and paid monthly.

   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fund and SBFM agreed that the Fund will
pay a reduced aggregate investment advisory and administrative fee on those
assets of the Fund attributable to the Fund's preferred shares such that SBFM
will accept an aggregate investment advisory and administrative fee at an
annual rate of 0.65% on those assets of the Fund equal to the product of the
number of preferred shares outstanding multiplied by the liquidation value of
such shares. The blended aggregate investment advisory and administrative fees
are equal, on an annual rate, to 82% of the Fund's average daily total net
assets. This fee is calculated daily and paid monthly.

   All officers and one Director of the Fund are employees of Citigroup or its
affiliates.

   4. INVESTMENTS

   During the year ended May 31, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases
and proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purchases                                                         $249,317,872

                                  (continued)



   At May 31, 2003, aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
investments for Federal income tax purposes were as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gross unrealized appreciation                                     $ 59,025,098
Gross unrealized depreciation                                      (24,649,268)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                       $ 34,375,830
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5. FUTURES CONTRACTS

   Securities or cash equal to the initial margin amount, which is made upon
entering into the futures contract, are either deposited with the broker or
segregated by the custodian. Additional securities are also segregated up to
the current market value of the futures contracts. During the period the
futures contract is open, changes in the value of the contract are recognized
as unrealized gains or losses by "marking-to-market" on a daily basis to
reflect the market value of the contract at the end of each day's trading.
Variation margin payments are received or made and recognized as assets due
from or liabilities due to broker, depending upon whether unrealized gains or
losses are incurred. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized
gain or loss equal to the difference between the proceeds from (or cost of) the
closing transactions and the Fund's basis in the contract.

   The Fund enters into such contracts to hedge a portion of its portfolio. The
Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in the value of the
financial instruments and securities indices.

   At May 31, 2003, the Fund had the following open futures contracts:

                   Number of               Basis        Market     Unrealized
                   Contracts Expiration    Value        Value         Loss

Bonds                2,400      6/03    $276,238,711 $289,200,000 $(12,961,289)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   6. AUCTION RATE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

   On May 22, 2002, the Fund issued 2,000 shares of Series M, Series T, Series
W, Series Th and Series F, respectively, of Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock ("ARCPS"). The underwriting discount of $2,500,000 and offering expenses
of $293,000 associated with the ARCPS offering were recorded as a reduction of
the capital paid in excess of par value of common stock for the year ended May
31, 2002. Additional offering costs of $71,209 were incurred and recorded as a
reduction of the capital paid in excess of par value of common stock for the
year ended May 31, 2003. The ARCPS'

                                  (continued)


dividends are cumulative at a rate determined at an auction and the dividend
period is typically 7 days. The dividend rates ranged from 0.90% to 1.75%
during the year ended May 31, 2003. At May 31, 2003, the current dividend rates
were as follows:

                         Series M Series T Series W Series Th Series F
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Current Dividend Rates    1.13%    1.10%    1.12%     1.19%    1.15%
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The ARCPS are redeemable under certain conditions by the Fund, or subject to
mandatory redemption (if the Fund is in default of certain coverage
requirements) at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share plus accumulated
and unpaid dividends. ARCPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share
plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

   The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverages with respect to the
ARCPS. If the Fund fails to maintain these coverages and does not cure any such
failure within the required time period, the Fund is required to redeem a
requisite number of the ARCPS in order to meet the applicable requirement.
Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing asset requirements would restrict
the Fund's ability to pay dividends to common stock shareholders.

   Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM"), formerly known as Salomon Smith
Barney Inc., another indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, currently
acts as a broker/dealer in connection with the auction of ARCPS. After each
auction, the auction agent will pay to each participating broker/dealer, from
monies the Fund provides, a participation fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of
the purchase price of the ARCPS that the broker/dealer places at the auction.
For the year ended May 31, 2003, CGM earned $623,923 as a participating
broker/dealer.

7.  TRANSFER OF NET ASSETS

   On April 26, 2002, the Fund acquired the assets and certain liabilities of
Managed Municipals Portfolio II Inc. pursuant to a plan of reorganization
approved by Managed Municipals Portfolio II Inc. shareholders on April 10,
2002. Total shares issued by the Fund and the total net assets of the Managed
Municipals Portfolio II Inc. and the Fund on the date of the transfer were as

acquisition included unrealized depreciation of $2,101,130, accumulated net
realized loss of $5,251,582, and overdistributed net investment income of

reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


8.  CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARD

   At May 31, 2003, the Fund had, for Federal income tax purposes,
approximately $28,511,000 of unused capital loss carryforwards available to
offset future capital gains. To the extent that these carryforward losses are
used to offset capital gains, it is probable that the gains so offset will not
be distributed. The amount and year of expiration for each carryforward loss is
indicated below. Expiration occurs on May 31 of the year indicated:

(1) The investment adviser and/or administrator waived a portion of its fees
    for the years ended May 31, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999. If such fees had not
    been waived, the per share decreases to net investment income and actual
    expense ratios would have been as follows:

                        Per share decreases to   Expense ratios
                        net investment income  without fee waivers

(2) Effective June 1, 2001, the Fund adopted a change in the accounting method
    that requires the Fund to amortize premiums and accrete all discounts.
    Without the adoption of this change, for the year ended May 31, 2002, the
    ratio of net investment income to average net assets would have been 4.81%.
    Per share information, ratios and supplemental data for the periods prior
    to June 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
    presentation. In addition, the impact of this change to net investment
    income and net realized and unrealized gain was less than $0.01 per share.
(3) The total return calculation assumes that dividends are reinvested in
    accordance with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Performance figures
    may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Past performance is
    no guarantee of future results. In the absence of fee waivers and/or
    expense reimbursements, the total return would be reduced.
(4) Calculated on basis of average net assets of common shareholders. Ratios do
    not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.
(5) On May 22, 2002, the Fund issued 2,000 shares of Auction Rate Cumulative
    Preferred Stock at $25,000 a share, for Series M, Series T, Series W,
    Series Th and Series F, respectively.
(6) Excludes accumulated undeclared dividends.
 *  Amount represents less than $0.01 per share.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



The Shareholders and Board of Directors of Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc.:

   We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,

("Fund") as of May 31, 2003, and the related statement of operations for the
year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the years
in the two-year period then ended and financial highlights for each of the
years in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of May 31, 2003, by correspondence
with the custodian. As to securities sold but not yet delivered, we performed
other appropriate auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Fund as of May 31, 2003, and the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the two-year
period then ended and financial highlights for each of the years in the

   For the year ended May 31, 2003, 99.98% of the dividends paid by the Fund
from net investment income were tax exempt for regular Federal income tax
purposes.

                          DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
                                  (unaudited)


   Under the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), a shareholder whose
shares of common stock are registered in his own name will have all
distributions from the Fund reinvested automatically by PFPC Global Fund
Services ("PFPC"), as purchasing agent under the Plan, unless the shareholder
elects to receive cash. Distributions with respect to shares registered in the
name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (that is, in street name) will be
reinvested by the broker or nominee in additional shares under the Plan, unless
the service is not provided by the broker or nominee or the shareholder elects
to receive distributions in cash. Investors who own common stock registered in
street name should consult their broker-dealers for details regarding
reinvestment. All distributions to shareholders who do not participate in the
Plan will be paid by check mailed directly to the record holder by or under the
direction of PFPC as dividend paying agent.

   The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the Plan
in lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. When the
market price of the common stock is equal to or exceeds 98% of the net asset
value per share of the common stock on the determination date (generally, the
record date for the distribution), Plan participants will be issued shares of
common stock by the Fund at a price equal to the greater of net asset value
determined as described below under "Net Asset Value" or 95% of the market
price of the common stock.

   If the market price of the common stock is less than 98% of the net asset
value of the common stock at the time of valuation (which is the close of
business on the determination date), PFPC will buy common stock in the open
market, on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. If following
the commencement of the purchases and before PFPC has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of the common stock as of the
valuation time, PFPC will attempt to terminate purchases in the open market and
cause the Fund to issue the remaining portion of the dividend or distribution
in shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) net asset value as of the
valuation time or (b) 95% of the then current market price. In this case, the
number of shares received by a Plan participant will be based on the weighted
average of prices paid for shares purchased in the open market and the price at
which the Fund issues the remaining shares. To the extent PFPC is unable to
stop open market purchases and cause the Fund to issue the remaining shares,
the average per share purchase price paid by PFPC may exceed the net asset
value of the common stock as of the valuation time, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or capital gains distribution
had been paid in common stock issued by the Fund at such net asset value. PFPC
will begin to purchase common stock on the open market as

                          DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
                            (unaudited) (continued)


soon as practicable after the determination date for the dividend or capital
gains distribution, but in no event shall such purchases continue later than 30
days after the payment date for such dividend or distribution, or the record
date for a succeeding dividend or distribution, except when necessary to comply
with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.

   PFPC maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmations of all transactions in each account, including information needed
by a shareholder for personal and tax records. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will not relieve Plan participants of
any income tax that may be payable on the dividends or capital gains
distributions. Common stock in the account of each Plan participant will be
held by PFPC in uncertificated form in the name of the Plan participant.

   Plan participants are subject to no charge for reinvesting dividends and
capital gains distributions under the Plan. PFPC's fees for handling the
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions will be paid by the
Fund. No brokerage charges apply with respect to shares of common stock issued
directly by the Fund under the Plan. Each Plan participant will, however, bear
a proportionate share of any brokerage commissions actually incurred with
respect to any open market purchases made under the Plan.

   Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes to it are desirable. The
Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by PFPC, with the Fund's prior written consent, on at least 30 days'
written notice to Plan participants. All correspondence concerning the plan
should be directed by mail to PFPC Global Fund Services, P.O. Box 8030, Boston,
Massachusetts 02266-8030 or by telephone at (800) 331-1710.

shares of its common stock in the open market.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to
         develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to the
         Manager. The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM"), a
         group of investment adviser affiliates of Citigroup, Inc.
         ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment advisers that comprise
         CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of proxy voting policies and
         procedures (the "Policies") to ensure that the Manager votes proxies
         relating to equity securities in the best interest of clients.

         In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
         principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best interest
         of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all factors that could
         affect the value of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner
         that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
         shareholder values. The Manager may utilize an external service
         provider to provide it with information and/or a recommendation with
         regard to proxy votes. However, such recommendations do not relieve the
         Manager of its responsibility for the proxy vote.

         In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated position in
         the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with such stated
         position. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a list of
         factors set forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such
         issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general
         principles set forth above and considering such enumerated factors. In
         the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated position or list
         of factors that CAM considers in voting on such issue, CAM votes on a
         case-by-case basis in accordance with the general principles set forth
         above. Issues for which there is a stated position set forth in the
         Policies or for which there is a list of factors set forth in the
         Policies that CAM considers in voting on such issues fall into a
         variety of categories, including election of directors, ratification of
         auditors, proxy and tender offer defenses, capital structure issues,
         executive and director compensation, mergers and corporate
         restructurings, and social and environmental issues. The stated
         position on an issue set forth in the Policies can always be
         superseded, subject to the duty to act solely in the best interest of
         the beneficial owners of accounts, by the investment management
         professionals responsible for the account whose shares are being voted.
         Issues applicable to a particular industry may cause CAM to abandon a
         policy that would have otherwise applied to issuers generally. As a
         result of the independent investment advisory services provided by
         distinct CAM business units, there may be occasions when different
         business units or different portfolio managers within the same business
         unit vote differently on the same issue.

         In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
         interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to
         identify and address material conflicts that may arise between the
         Manager's interests and those of its clients before voting proxies on
         behalf of such clients. To seek to identify conflicts of interest, CAM
         periodically notifies CAM employees (including employees of the
         Manager) in writing that they are under an obligation (i) to be aware
         of the potential for conflicts of interest with respect to voting
         proxies on behalf of client accounts both as a result of their personal
         relationships and due to special circumstances that may arise during
         the conduct of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to bring
         conflicts of interest of which they become aware to the attention of
         compliance personnel. The Manager also maintains and considers a list
         of significant relationships that could present a conflict of interest
         for the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is also sensitive to the
         fact that a significant, publicized relationship between an issuer and
         a non-CAM affiliate might appear to the public to influence the manner
         in which the Manager decides to vote a proxy with respect to such
         issuer. Absent special circumstances or a significant, publicized
         non-CAM affiliate relationship that CAM or the Manager for prudential
         reasons treats as a potential conflict of interest because such
         relationship might appear to the public to influence the manner in
         which the Manager decides to vote a proxy, the Manager generally takes
         the position that non-CAM relationships between Citigroup and an issuer
         (e.g. investment banking or banking) do not present a conflict of
         interest for the Manager in voting proxies with respect to such issuer.
         Such position is based on the fact that the Manager is operated as an
         independent business unit from other Citigroup business units as well
         as on the existence of information barriers between the Manager and
         certain other Citigroup business units.

         CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager personnel
         are members, to review and address conflicts of interest brought to its
         attention by compliance personnel. A proxy issue that will be voted in
         accordance with a stated position on an issue or in accordance with the
         recommendation of an independent third party is not brought to the
         attention of the Proxy Voting Committee for a conflict of interest
         review because the Manager's position is that to the extent a conflict
         of interest issue exists, it is resolved by voting in accordance with a
         pre-determined policy or in accordance with the recommendation of an
         independent third party. With respect to a conflict of interest brought
         to its attention, the Proxy Voting Committee first determines whether
         such conflict of interest is material. A conflict of interest is
         considered material to the extent that it is determined that such
         conflict is likely to influence, or appear to influence, the Manager's
         decision-making in voting proxies. If it is determined by the Proxy
         Voting Committee that a conflict of interest is not material, the
         Manager may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.

         If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of
         interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for
         determining an appropriate method to resolve such conflict of interest
         before the proxy affected by the conflict of interest is voted. Such
         determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances,
         including the importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the
         conflict of interest. Methods of resolving a material conflict of
         interest may include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict
         to clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting to
         clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on their
         behalf.
