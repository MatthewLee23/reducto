1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC and
the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (collectively the "Funds" and
individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of Delaware as limited liability
companies. The Funds are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end, non-diversified, management investment
companies. Each of the Funds is a fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital
appreciation by allocating their assets among a select group of private
investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds) ("Portfolio Funds") that
utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies specific for each Fund to
produce an attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent
of the various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes. Aetos
Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the Investment Manager to the Funds.

The Funds operate under a master fund/feeder fund structure. Feeder Funds invest
substantially all of their investable assets in the Funds. As of July 31, 2007
the Feeder Funds' beneficial ownership of their corresponding Master Funds'
members' capital are 67%, 61%, 67%, 72% and 76% for the Aetos Capital
Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Cayman Fund, Aetos
Capital Market Neutral Strategies Cayman Fund and Aetos Capital Opportunities
Cayman Fund, respectively.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market neutral
strategies.


                                                                              17

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Opportunities Fund") seeks capital
appreciation by investing its assets among a select group of alternative asset
managers employing different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of
attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital.

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current


                                                                              18

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions (continued)

market exchange and the differences could be material to the financial
statements. The use of different factors or estimation methodologies could have
a significant effect on the estimated fair value.

Realized gains and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the
identified cost basis. Investments are recorded on the effective date of the
subscription in the Portfolio Fund.

C. Fund Income and Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and consists of interest earned
on cash and cash equivalents.

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to continue to be treated as a partnership for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit
relating to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. The Funds withhold and pay taxes on U.S.
source income and U.S. effectively connected income, if any, allocated from
Portfolio Funds to the extent such income is not exempted from withholding under
the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations thereunder. The actual amount of such
taxes is not known until all Form K-1s from Portfolio Funds are received,
usually in the following tax year. Prior to the final determination the amount
of tax is estimated based on information available. The final tax could be
different from the estimated tax and the difference could be significant. Such
withholdings are listed as distributions in the Statements of Changes in
Members' Capital, and are allocated to the individual Members' Capital accounts
to which they apply.

E. Distribution Policy

The Funds have no present intention of making periodic distributions of their
net investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and
frequency of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of
the Board.


                                                                              19

<PAGE>

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

F. Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G. Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Funds treat all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three
months as cash equivalents.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.

The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the Opportunities Fund) of
each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May 31, 2008.

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Investment Manager may also be paid an annual performance-based incentive
fee outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of 0.12% on the first $250 million of net
assets, 0.10% on net assets between $250 million and $500 million and 0.08% on
net assets over $500 million, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.
Each Fund also pays the Custodian $3,000 annually to act as qualified Custodian
for its Cayman feeder fund.


                                                                              20

<PAGE>

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act receives an annual retainer of $32,000 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $3,250 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee receives an additional annual
retainer of $1,900. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interests in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Funds invest primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques, including
leverage, that may involve significant risks. These Portfolio Funds may invest a
high percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to
achieve a potentially greater investment return. As a result, the Portfolio
Funds may be more susceptible to economic, political, and regulatory
developments in a particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may
experience increased volatility of the Portfolio Funds' net asset value. The
Funds invest in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk.

Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Funds, including
risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Funds, risks relating to
compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of
Interests.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a

9. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Funds adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation
No. 48 "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB
STATEMENT NO. 109" ("FIN 48"), as required, on February 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires
the Investment Manager to determine whether a tax position of a Fund is more
likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing
authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes,
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized
is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent
likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement which could result in the Fund
recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. FIN 48 must be applied
to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption and the cumulative effect,
if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to net assets as of February 1, 2007.

Based on its analysis, the Investment Manager has determined that the adoption
of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Funds' financial statements upon
adoption. However, the Investment Manager's conclusions regarding FIN 48 may be
subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but
not limited to, further implementation guidance expected from the FASB, and
on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 157, "FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS." This standard establishes a single
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair
value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already required or permitted by
existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within
those fiscal years. The changes to current generally accepted accounting
principles from the application of this Statement relate to the definition of
fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures
about fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on the Funds' financial statement
disclosures.


                                                                              26

             Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements (unaudited)

At a meeting held in person on July 12, 2007, the Board of Managers of each
Fund, including the independent board members (the "Boards"), discussed the
materials previously provided to them and reviewed the nature, quality and scope
of the services provided to the Funds by Aetos. The Boards also considered the
proposed fees to be charged under the advisory agreements, as well as each
Fund's performance, and reviewed the comparative fee and performance data
previously provided by Aetos. The Independent Board Members reviewed reports
from third parties and management about the foregoing factors. The Board members
gave particular consideration to the following factors:

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

The Boards reviewed and considered the nature and extent of the investment
advisory services provided by Aetos to each Fund under the Investment Advisory
Agreements (the "Advisory Agreement"), including the selection of underlying
hedge funds ("Portfolio Funds"), allocation of each Fund's assets among, and
monitoring performance of, Portfolio Funds, evaluation of risk exposure of
Portfolio Funds and reputation, experience and training of Portfolio Funds'
investment managers ("Portfolio Managers"), management of short-term cash and
operations of each Portfolio Fund, and day-to-day portfolio management and
general due diligence examination of Portfolio Funds before and after committing
assets of each Fund for investment. The Boards also reviewed and considered the
nature and extent of the non-advisory, administrative services provided by Aetos
under the Advisory Agreement, including, among other things, providing to each
Fund office facilities, equipment, and personnel. The Boards also reviewed and
considered the qualifications of the portfolio managers, the senior
administrative managers and other key personnel of Aetos who provide the
investment advisory and administrative services to each Fund. The Boards
determined that Aetos' portfolio managers and key personnel are well qualified
by education and/or training and experience to perform the services in an
efficient and professional manner. The Boards concluded that the overall quality
of the advisory and administrative services was satisfactory.

PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPARABLE FUNDS MANAGED BY OTHER ADVISERS

The Boards reviewed the performance of each Fund based on information provided
by Aetos that showed (i) each Fund's historical performance as of May 2007
compared to various diversified hedge fund indices, and (ii) each Fund's return
for its most recent fiscal year as compared to the return of other comparable
registered funds-of-hedge-funds for their most recent fiscal years. The Boards
considered each Fund's positive performance since inception and the relative
lack of correlation of such performance to fixed income or equity indices
generally or to any one Portfolio Fund, and the relatively low level of
performance volatility of the Funds. The Boards concluded that each Fund's
performance was satisfactory.


                                                                              28

<PAGE>

       Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements (continued) (unaudited)

FEES AND EXPENSES RELATIVE TO COMPARABLE FUNDS MANAGED BY OTHER ADVISERS

The Boards reviewed the advisory fee rate and total expense ratio of each Fund.
The Boards also reviewed the annual 0.50% separate program (the "Program") fee
and the performance fee of 10% of aggregate Program net profits (the "Incentive
Fee") payable to Aetos by investors in the Funds. The Boards noted that Aetos
had contractually agreed to cap "other expenses," other than extraordinary or
non-recurring expenses, at 0.25% (0.35% with respect to the Aetos Capital
Opportunities Fund) at least until May 31, 2008, so that the net expenses
(excluding the Incentive Fee) do not exceed (a) 1.50% (1.60% with respect to an
investor in the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund) of an investor's average
monthly Program assets (assuming that the maximum Program fee applies), with
respect to investors participating in the Program or (b) 1.00% (1.10% with
respect to an investor in the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund) of an investor's
average monthly Fund assets, with respect to investors investing directly in the
Funds. The Boards also reviewed a report prepared by Aetos comparing the fees
payable by each Fund to those payable by other comparable registered
funds-of-hedge-funds. The Boards noted that the fees payable to Aetos, including
the Program fee and the Incentive Fee, were lower than or comparable to the fees
payable to the advisers of most comparable registered funds-of-hedge-funds. The
Board concluded that each Fund's advisory fee, Program fee, Incentive Fee and
total expense ratio were reasonable and satisfactory in light of the services
provided.

BREAKPOINTS AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE

The Boards reviewed the structure of each Fund's management fee schedule under
the Advisory Agreement and noted that it does not include any breakpoints. The
Boards considered that each Fund's advisory fee was 0.75% and concluded that the
fee was sufficiently low that the Boards did not need to consider adding
breakpoints at this time. The Boards also determined that, given the relative
size of each Fund, economies of scale were not a factor that needed to be
considered at this time.

PROFITABILITY OF ADVISER AND AFFILIATES

The Boards considered and reviewed information concerning the costs incurred and
profits realized by Aetos and its affiliates during the previous year from
Aetos' relationship with each Fund. The Boards noted that the Funds' investor
base consists of sophisticated investors that are capable of evaluating whether
the fees charged and the services provided by Aetos are appropriate. The Boards
noted that Aetos had only become profitable in 2005, and that its profit margins
had not been substantial since that time. Based on their review of the
information they received, the Boards concluded that the profits earned by Aetos
and its affiliates were not excessive in light of the advisory, administrative
and other services provided to each Fund.

GENERAL CONCLUSION

After considering and weighing all of the above factors, the Boards concluded it
would be in the best interest of each Fund and its members to approve renewal of
the Advisory Agreement for an additional annual term.


                                                                              29
