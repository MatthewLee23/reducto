(1)  Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.
(2)  PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
     determined by subtracting the initial investment from the value at the end
     of the period and dividing the remainder by the initial investment and
     expressing the result as a percentage. The calculation assumes that all of
     the Fund's income dividends have been reinvested at prices obtained under
     the dividend reinvestment plan. Total return does not reflect broker
     commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period of less than one
     year is not annualized. Total return for a period more than one year
     represents the average annual total return.

     An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
     Total return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
     in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
     intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the
     Fund may be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be
     subject to the alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end
     funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering
     and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market
     through a stock exchange. Net asset value is total assets applicable to
     common shareholders less total liabilities divided by the number of common
     shares outstanding. Holdings are subject to change daily.
(3)  Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the annualized current monthly
     per share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common
     share at March 31, 2004.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PIMCO Municipal Income Fund III ("Municipal III"), PIMCO California Municipal
Income Fund III ("California Municipal III") and PIMCO New York Municipal
Income Fund III ("New York Municipal III"), collectively referred to as the
"Funds", or "PIMCO Municipal Income Funds III" were organized as Massachusetts
business trusts on August 20, 2002. Prior to commencing operations on October
31, 2002, the Funds had no operations other than matters relating to their
organization and registration as closed-end management investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of 6,981 shares
of beneficial interest of each Fund at an aggregate purchase price of $100,003
per Fund to Allianz Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P. ("ADAM"). PA Fund
Management LLC (the "Investment Manager," formerly known as PIMCO Advisors Fund
Management LLC), serves as the Funds' Investment Manager and is an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary
of Allianz AG. The Funds each have an unlimited amount of $0.00001 par value
common stock authorized.

Municipal III invests substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of
municipal bonds, the interest from which is exempt from federal income taxes.
California Municipal III invests substantially all of its assets in municipal
bonds which pay interest that is exempt from federal and California state
income taxes. New York Municipal III invests substantially all of its assets in
municipal bonds which pay interest that is exempt from federal, New York State
and New York City income taxes. The Funds will seek to avoid bonds generating
interest income which could potentially subject individuals to alternative
minimum tax. The issuers' abilities to meet their obligations may be affected
by economic and political developments in a specific state or region.

Municipal III, California Municipal III and New York Municipal III issued
28,850,000, 19,500,000 and 5,000,000 shares of common stock, respectively, in
their initial public offerings. An additional 1,979,000, 1,634,000 and 424,000
shares of Municipal III, California Municipal III and New York Municipal III,
respectively, were issued in connection with the exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option on December 13, 2002. These shares were all issued at
$15.00 per share before an underwriting discount of $0.675 per share. The
Investment Manager agreed to reimburse the amount by which the aggregate of
each Fund's organizational and common offering costs (other than the sales
load) exceeded $0.03 per share. Common offering costs of $873,326, $634,020 and
$162,720 (representing $0.03 per share for each Fund), were offset against the
proceeds of the offerings and have been charged to paid-in capital in excess of
par. For Municipal III, aggregate common offering costs and organizational
expenses were less than $0.03 per common share. Consequently, organizational
expenses of $15,000 were expensed in the current period. For California
Municipal III and New York Municipal III, aggregate offering costs and
organizational expenses exceeded $0.03 per common share, as a result, all
organizational expenses and offering costs exceeding $0.03 per common share
were reimbursed by the Investment Manager.

In addition, the underwriters commission and offering costs associated with the
Funds' issuance of Preferred Shares in the amounts of $2,700,000 and $335,618,
$1,850,000 and $263,574 and $470,000 and $160,882, for Municipal III,
California Municipal III and New York Municipal III, respectively, have been
charged to paid-in capital in excess of par.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. The Funds'
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as such exposure would
involve claims that may be made against the Funds based upon events that have
not yet been asserted. However, the Funds expect the risk of any loss to be
remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds:

(A) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Portfolio securities and other financial instruments for which market
quotations are readily available are stated at market value. Debt securities
are valued daily by an independent pricing service approved by the Board of
Trustees. Prices obtained from independent pricing services use information
provided by market makers or estimates of market values obtained from yield
data relating to investments or securities with similar characteristics. The
value of the Funds' investments is determined at the close of regular trading
(normally, 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on
each day the NYSE is open. Short-term investments maturing in sixty days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Certain
fixed income securities for which daily market quotations are not readily
available may be valued, pursuant to guidelines established by the Board of
Trustees, with

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

reference to fixed income securities whose prices are more readily obtainable.
The prices used by the Funds to value securities may differ from the value that
would be realized if the securities were sold.

(B) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts or premiums on
debt securities purchased are accreted or amortized daily to non-taxable
interest income. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily to taxable income.

(C) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Funds intend to distribute all of their taxable income and to comply with
the other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for
U.S. federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
substantially all of their taxable ordinary income and long-term capital gains,
if any, during each calendar year, the Funds intend not to be subject to U.S.
federal excise tax.

(D) FUTURES CONTRACTS
A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a
financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract, the Funds are required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts, the Funds agree to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such receipts or payments are known as "variation margin" and are recorded by
the Funds as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the contracts are
closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference
between the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value
at the time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation
recorded is simultaneously reversed. The use of futures transactions involves
the risk of an imperfect correlation in the movements in the price of futures
contracts, interest rates and the underlying hedged assets, and the possible
inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

(E) OPTION TRANSACTIONS
For hedging purposes, the Funds may purchase and write (sell) put and call
options on municipal bonds, U.S. government securities, swap agreements,
indexes or futures contracts which are standardized and traded on a U.S. or
other exchange, boards of trade, or similar entity, or quoted on an automated
quotation system. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the
Funds pay a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the
Funds bear the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of
securities acquired through the exercise of call options is increased by the
premiums paid. The proceeds from the securities sold through the exercise of
put options is decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a
put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Funds bear the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an option
written could result in the Funds purchasing a security at price different from
the current market price.

(F) RESIDUAL INTEREST MUNICIPAL BONDS (RIBS)
The Funds invest in Residual Interest Municipal Bond ("RIBS") whose interest
rates bear an inverse relationship to the interest rate on another security or
the value of an index. RIBS are created by dividing the income stream provided
by the underlying bonds to create two securities, one short-term and one
long-term. The interest rate on the short-term component is reset by an index
or auction process normally every seven to 35 days. After income is paid on the
short-term securities at current rates, the residual income from the underlying
bond(s) goes to the long-term securities. Therefore, rising short-term interest
rates result in lower income for the longer-term portion, and vice versa. The
longer-term bonds may be more volatile and less liquid than other Municipal
Bonds of comparable maturity. An investment in RIBS typically will involve
greater risk than an investment in a fixed rate bond.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)

(G) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Funds declare dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. Each Fund records dividends and distributions to its
shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions
from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
accepted accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are considered
either temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts
based on their federal income tax treatment; temporary differences do not
require reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions exceed
current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes,
they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in capital in
excess of par.

(H) CUSTODY CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES
The Funds benefit from an expense offset arrangement with their custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian
expenses. Had these cash balances been invested in income producing securities,
they would have generated income for the Funds.

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
Each Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the
"Agreements") with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager to
each Fund. Subject to the supervision of each Fund's Board of Trustees, the
Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or through
others selected by it, the investment activities of the Fund and the Fund's
business affairs and other administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreements,
the Investment Manager will receive an annual fee, payable monthly, at the
annual rate of 0.65% of each Fund's average daily net assets (including net
assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be outstanding). In order
to reduce Fund expenses, the Investment Manager has contractually agreed to
waive a portion of its investment management fee for each Fund at the annual
rate of 0.15% of each Fund's average daily net assets (including net assets
attributable to any preferred shares that may be outstanding) from the
commencement of operations through October 31, 2007, and for a declining amount
thereafter through October 31, 2009.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment
Management Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), to manage each Fund's investments.
Subject to the supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all
investment decisions for the Funds. The Investment Manager (not the Funds) pays
a portion of the fees it receives to the Sub-Adviser in return for its
services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.50% of each Fund's average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be
outstanding). The Sub-Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of
the fees it is entitled to receive from the Investment Manager, such that the
Sub-Adviser will receive 0.26% of each Fund's average daily net assets
(including net assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be
outstanding) from the commencement of the Funds' operations through October 31,
2007, and will receive an increasing amount (not to exceed 0.50% of each Fund's
average daily net assets, including net assets attributable to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding) thereafter through October 31, 2009. The
Investment Manager informed the Funds that it paid the Sub-Adviser $934,581,
$629,830 and $164,518 in connection with sub-advisory services for Municipal
III, California Municipal III and New York Municipal III, respectively, for the
six months ended March 31, 2004.

The Funds are subject to certain limitations and restrictions while Preferred
Shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Funds from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation
value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the common stock but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on
any matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

On April 1, 2004, the following dividends were declared to common shareholders
payable May 3, 2004 to shareholders of record on April 16, 2004:

  Municipal III                    $0.0831 per common share
  California Municipal III           $0.08 per common share
  New York Municipal III             $0.08 per common share

On May 3, 2004, the following dividends were declared to common shareholders
payable June 1, 2004 to shareholders of record on May 14, 2004:

  Municipal III                    $0.0831 per common share
  California Municipal III           $0.08 per common share
  New York Municipal III             $0.08 per common share

6. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On February 12, 2004, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") informed the Investment Manager that it intended to recommend
that the Commission bring civil and administrative actions against the
Investment Manager and one of its investment advisory affiliates seeking a
permanent injunction against violations of certain provisions of the federal
securities laws, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest and civil penalties in
connection with the Commission staff's investigation of "market timing" and
related trading activities in certain open-end investment companies advised by
the Investment Manager (the "Subject Funds"). On February 17, 2004, the
Attorney General of New Jersey filed a complaint alleging, among other things,
that the Sub-Adviser and certain of its affiliates had failed to disclose that
they improperly allowed certain hedge funds to engage in "market timing" in the
Subject Funds and certain other mutual funds advised by the Sub-Adviser. The
complaint seeks injunctive relief, civil monetary penalties, restitution and
disgorgement of profits. On May 6, 2004, the Commission filed a complaint in
the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York alleging that the
Investment Manager, certain of its affiliates, and Stephen J. Treadway (the
Chief Executive Officer of the Investment Manager as well as the Chairman of
the Funds) had among other things, violated and/or aided and abetted violations
of various antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws in connection
with the alleged "market timing"

6. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONCLUDED)

arrangements disussed above. The complaint seeks injunctive relief,
disgorgement plus pre-judgment interest, monetary penalties, and an order
permanently enjoining the defendants from serving as investment advisers,
principal underwriters, officers, directors, or members of any advisory boards
to any registered investment companies.

The proceedings described above do not allege that any inappropriate activity
took place in the Funds and the Funds are not named in the proceedings.

If the New Jersey Attorney General or the Commission were to obtain a court
injunction against the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, certain of their
affiliates and/or Mr. Treadway and their affiliates would, in the absence of
exemptive relief granted by the Commission, be barred from serving as an
investment adviser/sub-adviser or principal underwriter for any registered
investment company, including the Funds. In such a case, the Investment Manager
and the Sub-Adviser would in turn seek exemptive relief from the Commission, as
contemplated by the Investment Company Act, although there is no assurance that
such exemptive relief would be granted. The Commission also has the power by
order to prohibit the Investment Manager, the Sub Adviser and certain of their
affiliates from serving as investment advisers and underwriters, although to
date it has not exercised such powers with respect to market timing
arrangements involving other mutual fund complexes.

Since February, 2004, the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and certain of
their affiliates, various investment companies advised by the Investment
Manager and the Sub-Adviser and their boards of trustees have been named as
defendants in multiple lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern
District of New York, the Central District of California and the Districts of
New Jersey and Connecticut. The lawsuits have been commenced as putative class
actions on behalf of investors who purchased, held or redeemed shares of the
specified funds during specified periods or as derivative actions on behalf of
the specified funds. The lawsuits generally relate to the same facts that are
the subject of the regulatory proceedings discussed above. The lawsuits seek
unspecified compensatory damages plus interest and, in some cases, punitive
damages, the rescission of investment advisory contracts and/or the return of
fees paid under those contracts and restitution. The Funds have been named in
two of the class action lawsuits, one filed in the Southern District of New
York and one filed in the District of New Jersey. The Investment Manager and
the Sub-Adviser believe that other similar lawsuits may be filed in Federal or
State Courts naming the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser, various investment
companies they advise (which may include the Funds), their boards or trustees
and/or their affiliates.

In November 2003, the Commission settled an enforcement action against an
unaffiliated broker-dealer relating to the undisclosed receipt of fees from
certain mutual fund companies in return for preferred marketing of their funds
and announced that it would be investigating mutual funds and their
distributors generally with respect to compensation arrangements relating to
the sale of mutual fund shares. In that connection, the Investment Manager, the
Sub-Adviser and certain of their affiliates are under investigation by the
Commission relating to revenue-sharing arrangements and the use of brokerage
commissions to recognize brokers effecting sales of open-end investment
companies advised by the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser and their
affiliates. In addition, the Attorney General of the State of California has
publicly announced an investigation into the brokerage recognition and
revenue-sharing arrangements of these open-end investment companies.

Although it is not possible to predict what, if any, effect the foregoing will
have on the market for the Funds' shares, the Investment Manager and the
Sub-Adviser believe that these matters are not likely to have a material
adverse effect on the operations of the Funds or on the Investment Manager's,
or Sub-Adviser's ability to perform their respective investment advisory
services to the Funds.

*     Commencement of operations.
**    Initial public offering price of $15.00 per share less underwriting
      discount of $0.675 per share.
(1)   Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
      at the current market price on the first day and a sale at the current
      market price on the last day for each period reported. Dividends are
      assumed, for purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices
      obtained under the Funds' dividend reinvestment plan. Total investment
      return does not reflect brokerage commissions or sales charges. Total
      investment return for a period of less than one year is not annualized.
(2)   Calculated on the basis of income and expenses applicable to both common
      and preferred shares relative to the average net assets of common
      shareholders.
(3)   Inclusive of expenses offset by custody credits earned on cash balances
      at the custodian bank. (See note 1.(h) in Notes to Financial Statements).
(4)   Annualized.
(5)   During the periods indicated above, the Investment Manager waived a
      portion of its investment management fee. If such waiver had not been in
      effect, the ratio of expenses to average net assets and the ratio of net
      investment income to average net assets would have been 1.41%
      (annualized) and 7.74% (annualized), respectively for the six months
      ended March 31, 2004, and 1.37% (annualized) and 5.24% (annualized),
      respectively for the period October 31, 2002 (commencement of operations)
      through September 30, 2003.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS in January 2004, the
Registrant's Board of Trustees adopted a Nominating Committee Charter governing
the affairs of the Nominating Committee of the Board, which is posted on the
PIMCO Advisors Funds website at www.pimcoadvisors.com. Appendix B to the
Nominating Committee Charter includes "Procedures for Shareholders to Submit
Nominee Candidates," which sets forth the procedures by which shareholders may
recommend nominees to the Registrant's Board of Trustees. The Registrant has not
held an annual shareholder meeting since this became effective, so these
procedures have yet to be disclosed in response to the requirements of Item
7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A, and this is the first Form N-CSR filing made by
the Registrant after Item 9 was added to the Form. Among other requirements, the
procedures provide that the recommending shareholder must submit any
recommendation in writing to the Registrant to the attention of the Registrant's
Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Registrant
and that such submission must be received at such offices not less than 45 days
nor more than 75 days prior to the date of the Board or shareholder meeting at
which the nominee would be elected. Any recommendation must include certain
biographical and other information regarding the candidate and the recommending
shareholder, and must include a written and signed consent of the candidate to
be named as a nominee and to serve as a Trustee if elected. The foregoing
description of the requirements is only a summary and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to Appendix B of the Nominating Committee Charter.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) The registrant's President and Chief Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended are effective based on their evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of this document.

(b) There were no significant changes in the registrant's internal controls or
in factors that could affect these controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses.

     Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
