PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' REPORT

Dear Shareholders:

ING Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust") is a diversified, closed-end investment
company that seeks to provide investors with as high a level of current income
as is consistent with the preservation of capital. The Trust seeks to achieve
this objective by investing in a professionally managed portfolio comprised
primarily of senior loans.

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The Trust declared $0.11 of common dividends during the second fiscal quarter
ended August 31, 2003, which, based on the average month-end net asset value
("NAV") per share of $7.01, resulted in an annualized distribution rate of
5.98%.(1) Total return (based on NAV) for the quarter was 3.43%, versus a gross
total return of 2.09% for the S&P/LSTA Loan Index, while total return for the
six months ended August 31, 2003 was 7.52%. The Trust's common shares also
continued to perform well during the quarter. Total return based on the market
value of the Trust's common shares (assuming full dividend reinvestment) for the
quarter was 7.54% and was 19.52% for the six months. The returns for the S&P 500
Index for the same time periods were 5.07% and 20.88% respectively.

MARKET/TRUST SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT

The overall tone of the senior loan market continued to brighten during the
quarter. Against the backdrop of an increasingly healthy macroeconomic picture
and improving corporate earnings, the default rate on non-investment grade bank
debt continued to decline, as evidenced by a 2.7% twelve-month lagging default
rate at the end of August, as compared to 6.0% at the beginning of 2003.
Further, many issuers that were struggling earlier in the year were able to take
advantage of more receptive capital markets to improve their balance sheet and
liquidity positions. The net effect has been a broad-based rally in loan prices
and markedly improved investor sentiment.

Specific to the Trust, recent performance continues to be favorably impacted by
three primary factors: 1) ongoing strength within sectors for which we have been
increasing relative weightings; 2) further improvement in market prices for
several of the Trust's larger holdings; and 3) continued decline in the number
of existing non-performing assets. During the quarter, we increased our exposure
to the Cable Television (10.5% of total assets at August 31, 2003, versus 8.6%
at May 31, 2003) and Cellular Communications (8.3%, as compared to 7.4%)
sectors. Both industry groups continue to display improving operating and credit
trends, and renewed acceptance by -- and access to -- alternative capital
markets. Buoyed largely by positive balance sheet developments at Charter
Communications (3.2% of total assets as of August 31, 2003), each of the Trust's
cable holdings gained ground during the quarter. The same can be said for the
Trust's wireless positions, led by Nextel Communications (at 5.0% of total
assets as of August 31, 2003, the single largest holding in the portfolio). We
continue to monitor developments in both the cable and wireless sectors closely.

As a key component of our ongoing strategy, we remain focused on maintaining an
appropriate level of diversification across both industry sector and issuer
lines. During the quarter, the Trust's average amount outstanding per loan
remained at roughly 0.3% of total loan assets, while the number of individual
loans declined modestly, to 330 from 343, based largely on refinancing
activities. As stated in prior reports, we continue to believe that adequate
diversification represents the best line of defense against broad-based credit
risk.

                                        2

USE OF LEVERAGE

The Trust utilizes financial leverage to seek to increase the yield to the
holders of common shares. As of August 31, 2003, the Trust had $484 million of
leverage, consisting of $450 million of "Aaa(2)/AAA(3)" rated cumulative auction
rate preferred shares, and $34 million outstanding under $415 million in
available credit facilities. Total leverage, as a percentage of total assets
(including preferred shares), was 33.2% at quarter end. The weighted average
leverage cost including all borrowings and preferred shares as of quarter end
was 1.35%. While the use of leverage for investment purposes increases both
investment opportunity and investment risk, we continue to deploy leverage only
when it is in the best interest of the Trust's common shareholders.

OUTLOOK

Coming off the impressive turnaround in the secured loan market that commenced
earlier in the year, we expect the balance of 2003 to be marked by relative
stability. Clearly, given the rapid price appreciation experienced during the
first half of the year, there generally remains minimal upside in existing loan
prices. Nonetheless, near-term performance could be underpinned by continued
improvement in credit and market conditions generally, and the continuation of a
reasonably sanguine attitude on the part of loan investors. Moreover, the
prospect of rising short-term rates in response to the now visible recovery in
the U.S. economy bodes well for the performance of adjustable rate senior loans.
As we move into the last part of 2003, we will continue to adhere to a
disciplined investment strategy that seeks to maintain a high degree of
diversification while attempting to take advantage of selective market
opportunities.

We thank you for your investment in ING Prime Rate Trust.

1.   The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing dividends declared
     during the quarter and dividing the resulting annualized dividend by the
     Trust's average month-end net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the
     average month-end NYSE Composite closing price (in the case of Market). The
     distribution rate is based solely on the actual dividends and
     distributions, which are made at the discretion of management. The
     distribution rate may or may not include all investment income and
     ordinarily will not include capital gains or losses, if any.

2.   Obligations rated Aaa by Moody's are judged to be of the highest quality,
     with minimal credit risk.

3.   An obligator rated 'AAA' has extremely strong capacity to meet its
     financial commitments. 'AAA' is the highest Issuer Credit Rating assigned
     by Standard & Poor's.

INDEX DESCRIPTIONS

The S&P 500 INDEX is a capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks chosen for
market size, liquidity, and industry group representation.

The S&P/LSTA LEVERAGED LOAN INDEX ("LLI") is a total return index that captures
accrued interest, repayments, and market value changes. It represents a broad
cross section of leveraged loans syndicated in the United States, including
dollar-denominated loans to overseas issuers. Standard & Poor's and the Loan
Syndications & Trading Association ("LSTA") conceived the LLI to establish a
performance benchmark for the syndicated leveraged loan industry.

ALL INDICES ARE UNMANAGED. AN INVESTOR CANNOT INVEST DIRECTLY IN AN INDEX.

STATISTICS AND PERFORMANCE FOOTNOTES

(A)  Yield is calculated by dividing the Trust's net investment income per share
     for the most recent thirty days by the net asset value (in the case of NAV)
     or the NYSE Composite closing price (in the case of market) at quarter-end.
     Yield calculations do not include any commissions or sales charges, and are
     compounded for six months and annualized for a twelve-month period to
     derive the Trust's yield consistent with the SEC standardized yield formula
     for open-end investment companies.

(B)  The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing each monthly dividend,
     then averaging the annualized dividends declared for each month during the
     quarter and dividing the resulting average annualized dividend amount by
     the Trust's average net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the NYSE
     Composite closing price (in the case of Market) at the end of the period.

(C)  Calculation of total return assumes a hypothetical initial investment at
     the net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the NYSE Composite closing
     price (in the case of Market) on the last business day before the first day
     of the stated period, with all dividends and distributions reinvested at
     the actual reinvestment price.

(D)  On December 27, 1994, the Trust issued to its shareholders transferable
     rights which entitled the holders to subscribe for 17,958,766 shares of the
     Trust's common stock at the rate of one share of common stock for each four
     rights held. On January 27, 1995, the offering expired and was fully
     subscribed. The Trust issued 17,958,766 shares of its common stock to
     exercising rights holders at a subscription price of $8.12. Offering costs
     of $4,470,955 were charged against the offering proceeds.

(E)  On October 18, 1996, the Trust issued to its shareholders non-transferable
     rights which entitled the holders to subscribe for 18,122,963 shares of the
     Trust's common stock at the rate of one share of common stock for each five
     rights held. On November 12, 1996, the offering expired and was fully
     subscribed. The Trust issued 18,122,963 shares of its common stock to
     exercising rights holders at a subscription price of $9.09. Offering costs
     of $6,972,203 were charged against the offering proceeds.

(F)  Inception Date -- May 12, 1988. Since inception return is not applicable
     since the Trust did not trade on the NYSE prior to March 9, 1992.

(G)  Initial Trading on NYSE -- March 9, 1992.

(H)  Reflects partial waiver of fees.

ADDITIONAL NOTES AND INFORMATION

SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENT PROGRAM

The Trust offers a Shareholder Investment Program (the "Program," formerly known
as the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan) which allows holders of the
Trust's common shares a simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gains
distributions, if any, in additional common shares of the Trust. The Program
also offers holders of the Trust's common shares the ability to make optional
cash investments in any amount from $100 to $25,000 on a monthly basis. Amounts
in excess of $25,000 require prior approval of the Trust. DST Systems, Inc., the
Trust's Transfer Agent, is the administrator for the Program.

For dividend reinvestment purposes, DST Systems, Inc. will purchase shares of
the Trust on the open market when the market price plus estimated commissions is
less than the net asset value on the valuation date. The Trust may issue new
shares when the market price plus estimated commissions is equal to or exceeds
the net asset value on the valuation date. New shares may be issued at the
greater of (i) net asset value or (ii) the market price of the shares during the
pricing period, minus a discount of 5%.

For optional cash investments, shares will be purchased on the open market by
the DST Systems, Inc. when the market price plus estimated commissions is less
than the net asset value on the valuation date. New shares may be issued by the
Trust when the market price plus estimated commissions is equal to or exceeds
the net asset value on the valuation date.

There is no charge to participate in the Program. Participants may elect to
discontinue participation in the Program at any time. Participants will share,
on a pro-rata basis, in the fees or expenses of any shares acquired in the open
market.

Participation in the Program is not automatic. If you would like to receive more
information about the Program or if you desire to participate, please contact
your broker or our Shareholder Services Department at (800) 992-0180.

(2)  Total investment return measures the change in the market value of your
     investment assuming reinvestment of dividends and capital gain
     distributions, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend
     reinvestment plan.
(3)  Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a
     purchase at net asset value at the beginning of each period and a sale at
     net asset value at the end of each period and assumes reinvestment of
     dividends and capital gain distributions in accordance with the provisions
     of the dividend reinvestment plan. This calculation differs from total

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as of August 31, 2003 (Unaudited)

NOTE 1 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ING Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust"), a Massachusetts business trust, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"), as a diversified, closed-end, investment management company. The Trust
invests in senior loans which are exempt from registration under the Securities
Act of 1933 as amended (the "33 Act"), but contain certain restrictions on
resale and cannot be sold publicly. These loans bear interest (unless otherwise
noted) at rates that float periodically at a margin above the Prime Rate of a
U.S. bank specified in the credit agreement, the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
("LIBOR"), the certificate of deposit rate, or in some cases another base
lending rate. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial
statements. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

A.   SENIOR LOAN AND OTHER SECURITY VALUATION. Loans are normally valued at the
     mean of the means of one or more bid and asked quotations obtained from a
     pricing service or other sources determined by the Board of Trustees to be
     independent and believed to be reliable. Loans for which reliable market
     value quotations are not readily available may be valued with reference to
     another loan or a group of loans for which quotations are more readily
     available and whose characteristics are comparable to the loan being
     valued. Under this approach, the comparable loan or loans serve as a proxy
     for changes in value of the loan being valued. The Trust has engaged an
     independent pricing service to provide quotations from dealers in loans and
     to calculate values under the proxy procedure described above. As of August
     31, 2003, 94.68% of total investments were valued based on these
     procedures. It is expected that most of the loans held by the Trust will be
     valued with reference to quotations from the independent pricing service or
     with reference to the proxy procedure described above.

     Prices from a pricing source may not be available for all loans and ING
     Investments, LLC (the "Investment Manager") or Aeltus Investment
     Management, Inc. ("ING Aeltus" the "Sub-Advisor"), may believe that the
     price for a loan derived from market quotations or the proxy procedure
     described above is not reliable or accurate. Among other reasons, this may
     be the result of information about a particular loan or borrower known to
     the Investment Manager that the Investment Manager believes may not be
     known to the pricing service or reflected in a price quote. In this event,
     the loan is valued at fair value as determined in good faith under
     procedures established by the Trust's Board of Trustees and in accordance
     with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Under these procedures, fair value is
     determined by the Investment Manager and monitored by the Trust's Board of
     Trustees through its Valuation Committee. In fair valuing a loan,
     consideration is given to several factors, which may include, among others,
     the following: (i) the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data
     relating to the loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate,
     period until the next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate
     of the loan, the terms and conditions of the loan and any related
     agreements, and the position of the loan in the borrower's debt structure;
     (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the collateral, including the
     Trust's rights, remedies and interests with respect to the collateral;
     (iii) the creditworthiness of the borrower and the cash flow coverage of
     outstanding principal and interest, based on an evaluation of its financial
     condition, financial statements and information about the borrower's
     business, cash flows, capital structure and future prospects; (iv)
     information relating to the market for the loan, including price quotations
     for, and trading in, the loan and interests in similar loans; (v) the
     reputation and financial condition of the agent for the loan and any
     intermediate participants in the loan; (vi) the borrower's management; and
     (vii) the general economic and market conditions affecting the fair value
     of the loan. Securities for which the primary market is a national
     securities exchange are valued at the last reported sale price. Securities
     reported by NASDAQ will be valued at NASDAQ official closing price. Debt
     and equity securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed
     securities for

                                       14
<Page>

     which no sale was reported on that date are valued at the mean between the
     last reported bid and asked price. Securities other than senior loans for
     which reliable quotations are not readily available and all other assets
     will be valued at their respective fair values as determined in good faith
     by, or under procedures established by, the Board of Trustees of the Trust.
     Investments in securities maturing in less than 60 days from the date of
     acquisition are valued at amortized cost.

B.   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. It is the Trust's policy to comply with the
     requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to "regulated
     investment companies" and to distribute all of its taxable income to its
     shareholders. Therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required.
     In addition, by distributing during each calendar year substantially all of
     its net investment income and net realized capital gains (if any), the
     Trust intends not to be subject to any federal excise tax.

C.   SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND REVENUE RECOGNITION. Loans are booked on a
     settlement date basis and security transactions are accounted for on trade
     date (date the order to buy or sell is executed). Realized gains or losses
     are reported on the basis of identified cost of securities delivered.
     Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is
     recorded on an accrual basis at the then-current interest rate of the loan.
     The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when, in the opinion of
     management, there is an indication that the borrower may be unable to meet
     payments as they become due. Upon such discontinuance, all unpaid accrued
     interest is reversed. Cash collections on nonaccrual senior loans are
     generally applied as a reduction to the recorded investment of the loan.
     Senior loans are returned to accrual status only after all past due amounts
     have been received. For all loans acquired prior to March 1, 2001,
     arrangement fees, which represent non-refundable fees associated with the
     acquisition of loans are deferred and recognized over the shorter of 2.5
     years or the actual terms of the loan. For all loans, except revolving
     credit facilities, acquired subsequent to February 28, 2001, fees are
     treated as discounts and accreted as described in Note 1.H. Fees associated
     with revolving credit facilities acquired subsequent to February 28, 2001
     are deferred and recognized over the shorter of 4 years or the actual term
     of the loan.

D.   DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. The Trust records distributions to
     its shareholders on the ex-dividend date. Distributions from income are
     declared by the Trust on a monthly basis. Distributions from capital gains,
     if any, are declared on an annual basis.

E.   DIVIDEND REINVESTMENTS. Pursuant to the Shareholder Investment Program
     (formerly known as the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan), DST Systems,
     Inc., the Plan Agent, purchases, from time to time, shares of beneficial
     interest of the Trust on the open market to satisfy dividend reinvestments.
     Such shares are purchased only when the closing sale or bid price plus
     commission is less than the net asset value per share of the stock on the
     valuation date. If the market price plus commissions is equal to or exceeds
     the net asset value, new shares are issued at the greater of (i) net asset
     value or (ii) the market price of the shares during the pricing period,
     minus a discount of 5%.

F.   USE OF ESTIMATES. Management of the Trust has made certain estimates and
     assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues,
     expenses and contingencies to prepare these financial statements in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
     States of America. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

G.   SHARE OFFERINGS. During the year ended February 28, 1999, the Trust began
     issuing shares under various shelf registration statements, whereby the net
     proceeds received by the Trust from share sales may not be less than the
     greater of (i) the NAV per share or (ii) 94% of the average daily market
     price over the relevant pricing period.

                                       15

H.   CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE. In November 2000 the American Institute of
     Certified Public Accountants (the "AICPA") issued a revised version of the
     AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (the "Guide").
     Effective March 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the Guide and
     began amortizing premiums and accreting discounts on debt securities. Prior
     to March 1, 2001, the Trust had not amortized premiums nor accreted
     discounts. The cumulative effect of this accounting change had no impact on
     net assets of the Trust, but resulted in a $3,653,000 increase in the cost
     of securities and a corresponding $3,653,000 increase in net unrealized
     depreciation of investments, based on securities held by the Trust on March
     1, 2001.

NOTE 2 -- INVESTMENTS

For the six months ended August 31, 2003, the cost of purchases and the proceeds
from principal repayment and sales of investments, excluding short-term notes,
totaled $515,831,953 and $665,034,023, respectively. At August 31, 2003, the
Trust held senior loans valued at $1,372,978,553 representing 96.0% of its total
investments. The market value of these assets is established as set forth in
Note 1.

The senior loans acquired by the Trust may take the form of a direct lending
relationship with the borrower, an assignment of a lender's interest in a loan.
The lead lender in a typical corporate loan syndicate administers the loan and
monitors collateral. In the event that the lead lender becomes insolvent, enters
FDIC receivership or, if not FDIC insured, enters into bankruptcy, the Trust may
incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment, or may suffer a loss of
principal and/or interest.

Common and preferred shares, and stock purchase warrants held in the portfolio
were acquired in conjunction with senior loans held by the Trust. Certain of
these stocks and warrants are restricted and may not be publicly sold without
registration under the '33 Act, or without an exemption under the '33 Act. In
some cases, these restrictions expire after a designated period of time after
issuance of the shares or warrant.

The Fund values portfolio securities by using the market value of the securities
when reliable market value quotations for the securities are readily available.
When reliable market value quotations are not readily available, the Fund
determines, in good faith, the fair value of the

                                       16
<Page>

securities in accordance with the Trust's fair valuation procedures as
established by the Board of Trustees. Dates of acquisition and cost or assigned
basis of restricted securities are as follows:

The Trust has adopted a Retirement Policy covering all independent trustees of
the Trust who will have served as a independent trustee for at least five years
at the time of retirement. Benefits under this plan are based on an annual rate
as defined in the plan agreement.

NOTE 4 -- COMMITMENTS

The Trust has entered into both a $90 million 364-day revolving credit agreement
which matures on August 25, 2004 and a $325 million 364-day revolving
securitization facility which matures on June 12, 2004, collateralized by assets
of the Trust. Borrowing rates under these agreements are based on a fixed spread
over LIBOR, the federal funds rate, or a commercial paper-based rate. Prepaid
arrangement fees for any unborrowed amounts are amortized over the term of the
agreements. The amount of borrowings outstanding at August 31, 2003, was $34
million, at a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. The amount of borrowings
represented 2.3% of total assets at August 31, 2003. Average borrowings for the
period ended August 31, 2003 were $105,597,826 and the average annualized
interest rate was 2.1%.

On November 2, 2000, the Trust issued 3,600 shares each of Series M, Series W
and Series F Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares, $.01 Par Value, $25,000
liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $270 million. Also, on November
16, 2000, the Trust issued 3,600 shares of Series T and Series Th Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Shares, $.01 Par Value, $25,000, liquidation preference,
for a total issuance of $180 million. Costs associated with the offering of
approximately $5,438,664 were charged against the proceeds received. The Trust
used the net proceeds of the offering to partially pay down the then existing
indebtedness. The Trust may reborrow amounts in the future to increase its use
of leverage which will be consistent with the limitations imposed by the 1940
Act. Preferred Shares pay dividends based on a rate set at auctions, normally
held every 7 days. In most instances dividends are also payable every 7 days, on
the first business day following the end of the rate period.

NOTE 6 -- CUSTODIAL AGREEMENT

State Street Bank and Trust Company ("SSB") serves as the Trust's custodian and
recordkeeper. Custody fees paid to SSB are reduced by earnings credits based on
the cash balances held by SSB for the Trust. There were no earnings credits for
the period ended August 31, 2003.

NOTE 7 -- SUBORDINATED LOANS AND UNSECURED LOANS

The primary risk arising from investing in subordinated loans or in unsecured
loans is the potential loss in the event of default by the issuer of the loans.
The Trust may acquire a subordinated loan only if, at the time of acquisition,
it acquires or holds a Senior Loan from the same borrower. The Trust will
acquire unsecured loans only where the Investment Manager believes, at the time
of acquisition, that the Trust would have the right to payment upon default that
is not subordinate to any other creditor. The Trust may invest up to 5% of its
total assets, measured at the time of investment, in subordinated loans and
unsecured loans. As of August 31, 2003, the Trust held 2.1% of its total assets
in subordinated loans and unsecured loans.

NOTE 8 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Dividends paid by the Trust from net investment income and distributions of net
realized short-term capital gains (if any) are, for federal income tax purposes,
taxable as ordinary income to shareholders. The tax composition of dividends and
distributions to common shareholders for six months ended August 31, 2003 and
year ended February 28, 2003 were as follows:

</Table>

The amount of distributions from net investment income and net realized capital
gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. These "book/tax"
differences are either considered temporary or

                                       19
<Page>

permanent in nature. Key differences are the treatment of short-term capital
gains, foreign currency transactions, organization costs and other temporary
differences. To the extent that these differences are permanent in nature, such
amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal
tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassifications. To
the extent distributions exceed net investment income and/or net realized
capital gains for tax purposes, they are reported as distributions of paid-in
capital.

        controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to

        internal controls; and

        employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
