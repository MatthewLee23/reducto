                              GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

                              Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                              structure combines the specialized expertise of
                              three world-class investment management groups--
                              Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE         Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                              autonomously, relying on its own research and
                              staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                              that underlie its success.

                              FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                              recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                              also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                              U.S. equity investing.

                              TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                              international investing and, in 1954, launched
                              what has become the industry's oldest global fund.
                              Today, with research offices in over 25 countries,
                              they offer investors the broadest global reach in
                              the industry.

                              MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                              dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                              searching aggressively for opportunity among
                              undervalued stocks, arbitrage situations and
                              distressed companies.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION          Because our management groups work independently
                              and adhere to distinctly different investment
                              approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series
                              funds typically have a low overlap of securities.
                              That's why our funds can be used to build truly
                              diversified portfolios covering every major asset
                              class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST     At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                              consistently provide investors with exceptional
                              risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                              as the reliable account services that have helped
                              us become one of the most trusted names in
                              financial services.

SEMIANNUAL REPORT

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON
LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

YOUR FUND'S GOAL AND MAIN INVESTMENTS: Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust seeks to provide high, current income, with a secondary objective
of capital appreciation to the extent possible, through a portfolio consisting
primarily of high yield corporate bonds, floating rate bank loans and mortgage-
and other asset-backed securities.

Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to bring you Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust's
semiannual report for the period ended September 30, 2004.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
Trust posted cumulative total returns of +3.20% based on net asset value and
+1.95% based on market price. Share price, as measured by net asset value,
decreased from $14.75 per share on March 31, 2004, to $14.60 at period-end, and
the market price fell from $14.87 to $14.54 over the same period. You can find
the Fund's performance data in the Performance Summary on page 6.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Over the past six months, the confusing employment picture was a dominant topic.
While the unemployment rate declined to 5.4% on September 30, 2004,

THE DOLLAR VALUE, NUMBER OF SHARES OR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, AND NAMES OF ALL
PORTFOLIO HOLDINGS ARE LISTED IN THE FUND'S STATEMENT OF INVESTMENTS (SOI). THE

and there was some job growth, job creation according to the most recent
nonfarm payroll statistics disappointed many market participants.(1) However,
other sources, such as one from the National Federation of Independent
Businesses (NFIB), showed stronger gains. The NFIB survey was particularly
interesting, because small businesses historically have created about two-thirds
of all new U.S. jobs.(2) As a result, many market participants believed that job
growth was not accurately reflected in the nonfarm payroll numbers. During
the period under review, more jobs combined with reductions in income tax,
helped to increase consumers' disposable income and allowed them to continue
spending. That spending kept the economy growing.

Increases in business spending also contributed to economic growth. After
steadily declining in 2001 and 2002, business spending posted strong results
during the period. For example, nonresidential investment spending increased
12.5% and 11.7% in the second and third quarters of 2004.(3) Historically low
interest rates during the reporting period allowed many businesses the
opportunity to refinance their old debt at more attractive levels. This helped
enhance business operating performance, and corporate profits reflected this
data. Many corporate debt products also benefited from this improvement.
Productivity continued to grow, which helped businesses generate more goods and
services without substantially raising inflation.

Although energy prices rose 4.7% for the six months under review, the core
Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation excluding food and energy costs,
rose a more subdued 2.0% for the 12 months ended September 30, 2004.(1)
Expected inflation is a key determinant of interest rates, and this environment
contributed to the continued low level of interest rates during the period. The
10-year U.S. Treasury yield rose modestly from 3.86% at the beginning of the
period to 4.14% on September 30, 2004.

In general, this overall environment of positive economic growth and relatively
modest increases in interest rates benefited the more credit-sensitive sectors
of the fixed income markets (such as corporate bonds and bank loans) while
somewhat constraining returns for the more interest-rate sensitive sectors.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, primarily high yield
corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and mortgage- and

other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of macroeconomic trends
combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and
issuers drives our investment process. We seek to maintain a limited duration,
or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the impact that fluctuating interest
rates might have on the Fund's fixed income portfolio. Within the corporate bond
and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable valuations from
issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions, stable cash flows,
reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and
improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream and total
return through our analysis of security prepayment assumptions, pricing
inefficiencies, and underlying collateral characteristics.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

In terms of sector allocation, at period-end high yield corporate bonds
continued to represent our largest sector weighting as we believed supportive
fundamental credit trends should buoy performance for that sector. Our second
largest sector weighting was in floating rate bank loans, which should also be
beneficiaries of this improving credit cycle trend. Moreover, the floating-rate
nature of this asset class generally makes leveraged loans more immune to rising
interest rates. In fact, these loans typically offer higher nominal yields to
investors as short-term interest rates rise, which they have experienced since
June 2004. Finally, during the period, returns for our mortgage-backed
securities (MBS) holdings were somewhat constrained by a modest interest rate
rise, although that market's current yield allowed the sector to still post
positive total returns.

The high yield corporate bond sector was the strongest performer in terms of
total return during the period, as a declining default rate and the prospect for
continued below-average defaults supported bond prices. Consequently, valuations
became richer during the period, with this sector's average yield spread over
Treasuries falling from 5.0% at the beginning of the period to 4.3% by
period-end. Even though valuations were somewhat rich compared with longer-term
averages, we looked favorably on the fundamental credit trends for high yield
issuers, and therefore, still found attractive value in this sector. Overall,
our high yield corporate bond weighting rose moderately during the period,
resulting from select purchases and outperformance relative to the Fund's other
sector holdings.

Over the past six months, demand in the leveraged bank loan market
remained relatively strong as money continued to flow into that asset class.
Much of the strong demand came from investors anticipating the Federal

*     All Fund distributions will vary depending upon current market conditions,
      and past distributions are not indicative of future trends.

Reserve Board would increase short-term interest rates and thereby positively
impact the yield offered by floating rate leveraged loans. Fueled by increasing
merger and acquisition activity, institutional loan new issuance was robust, the
highest level seen in the last five years, but was absorbed well by the market.
In terms of valuations, institutional loan spreads above the London InterBank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) remained near historical lows. Moreover, the strong demand
for loans gave borrowers additional flexibility with many loans repricing to
lower spreads. Although a rising proportion of lower-rated new issues may
present credit problems in the future, overall fundamental credit trends
remained generally favorable, with rising corporate earnings and generally good
corporate liquidity. Given supportive fundamental credit trends, somewhat offset
by historically rich valuations, the Fund's loan exposure remained relatively
unchanged during the period as our incremental demand for loans was offset by a
number of paydowns and refinancings. During the period under review, the
floating rate bank loan market, where the Fund held 26.5% of total investments
at period-end, remained strong, benefiting our underlying holdings within the
sector.

Over the period, market interest rates gyrated, reflecting changing expectations
for economic growth and potential inflation. In the mortgage-backed sector, our
research guided us to the opportunity to move current positions toward higher
coupon issues. We reallocated out of some 5.0% coupon, 30-year maturity MBS into
the 5.5% and 6.0% coupon range. These higher coupon positions offered less price
risk as interest rates rose. We also looked to investing in more specified pool
securities. One sector of the specified pool market where we increased
allocation was MBS backed by mortgages with relatively low loan balances. We
believed that the borrowers behind these loans had reduced incentive to
refinance their loans. We also looked to some higher quality mortgage
related-securities to help add yield as these securities typically carry a yield
premium over their government-guaranteed counterparts. With a modest rise in
intermediate-term interest rates, offset by the current yield offered in the
sector, mortgages were able to provide positive total returns during the
six-month period. Overall, our weighting in mortgages and other asset-backed
securities remained relatively flat during the period.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers you a prompt and
simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions
("Distributions") in shares of the Fund. PFPC, Inc. (the "Agent"), P.O. Box
43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027, will act as your Agent in administering the
Plan. The Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in the same name as
your outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and Conditions of
the Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained from the Fund at the
address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants should note that they will not
be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares at a specific time or at a
specific price. The Agent may make open-market purchases on any securities
exchange where shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.


8 | Semiannual Report
<PAGE>

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
the American stock exchange, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that
date, then the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange
on such date. The net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the
amount most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.
The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of
its employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants of the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve you of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the


                                                           Semiannual Report | 9
<PAGE>

acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of the Fund, no certificates for a fractional
share will be issued. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to
your account. If you terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will
adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of
shares at the time of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at 1-800/331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON

LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (the Fund) is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end investment
company. The Fund seeks high current income. The following summarizes the Fund's
significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange are valued at the
last reported sales price. Securities listed or traded on NASDAQ are valued at
their official closing price. Debt securities, other over-the-counter
securities and listed securities for which no sale is reported are valued within
the range of the latest quoted bid and asked prices by independent pricing
services or recognized dealers in such securities. Foreign securities are
valued at the close of trading of the foreign exchange or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If events occur that materially affect the values of securities after
the prices or foreign exchange rates are determined, but prior to 4:00 p.m.
Eastern time or the close of trading on the NYSE, whichever is earlier, or if
market quotations are deemed not readily available or reliable, the securities
will be valued at fair value. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at
the closing net asset value. All security valuation procedures are approved by
the Board of Trustees.

The Fund invests in senior secured corporate loans and senior secured debt that
meet credit standards established by Franklin Advisers, Inc. The Fund values its
securities based on quotations provided by banks, broker/dealers or pricing
services experienced in such matters.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded
amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S.
dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates
on foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in
securities held at the end of the reporting period.


                                                          Semiannual Report | 23

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON

LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED, DELAYED DELIVERY, OR TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery, or
to-be-announced (TBA) basis, with payment and delivery scheduled for a future
date. These transactions are subject to market fluctuations and are subject to
the risk that the value at delivery may be more or less than the trade date
purchase price. Although the Fund will generally purchase these securities with
the intention of holding the securities, it may sell the securities before the
settlement date.

D. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund enters into mortgage dollar rolls, typically on a TBA basis. Dollar
rolls are agreements between the Fund and a financial institution to
simultaneously sell and repurchase a mortgage-backed security at a future date.
Gains or losses are realized at the time of the sale and the difference between
the repurchase price and sale price is recorded as an unrealized gain to the
Fund. The risks of mortgage dollar roll transactions include the potential
inability of the counterparty to fulfill its obligations.

E. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

F. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under Sub Chapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income. Fund
distributions to shareholders are determined on an income tax basis and may
differ from net investment income and realized gains for financial reporting
purposes.

G. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Discounts and premiums
on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the respective
securities. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

H. OFFERING COSTS

Offering costs are charged to paid-in-capital upon the sale of Fund shares.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

I. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Funds' organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

On August 27, 2003, the Fund completed the initial public offering. On September
25, 2003 and October 14, 2003, the Fund issued additional shares in connection
with the exercise of the underwriters' over allotment allocation option.
Shares were issued at $15.00 per share before the underwriters discount of
$0.675 per share. The Fund's manager agreed in advance to assume as its own
expense all offering and organizational expenses in excess of $.03 per share,
excluding the underwriters' discount.

Transactions in the Fund's common shares were as follows:

3. AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

On November 7, 2003 the Fund issued 2,534 Preferred Shares Series M, 2,533
Preferred Shares Series W and 2,533 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference per share totaling $190,000,000. Dividends to
preferred shareholders are cumulative and are declared weekly, at rates
established through an auction process. In connection with the weekly auctions,
the Fund pays an annual fee as well as commissions to the auction agent for its
services. During the period ended September 30, 2004, the dividends on Preferred
Shares ranged from 1.02% to 1.87%.

The Fund is required to maintain on a weekly basis a specified discounted value
of its portfolio in compliance with guidelines established by Fitch Ratings and
Moody's Investor Services Inc., and is required to maintain asset coverage for
the Preferred Shares of at least 200%.

The Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund at any time and are subject to
mandatory redemption if the asset coverage or discounted value requirements
are not met. During the period ended September 30, 2004, all requirements were
met.

4. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund are also officers and/or directors of
the following entities:

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ENTITY                                                 AFFILIATION

   Franklin Advisers Inc. (Advisers)                      Investment manager
   Franklin Templeton Services LLC (FT Services)          Administrative manager

The Fund pays an investment management fee and administrative fee to Advisers
and FT Services of .50% and .20%, respectively, per year of the average daily
net assets, plus the liquidation value of the preferred shares.

5. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the period ended September 30, 2004, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.

6. INCOME TAXES

At September 30, 2004, the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) based on
the cost of investments for income tax purposes was as follows:

Cost of investments ......................      $ 568,999,515
                                                =============
Unrealized appreciation ..................      $  12,430,025
Unrealized depreciation ..................         (3,790,994)
                                                -------------
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation)      $   8,639,031
                                                =============

At March 31, 2004, the Fund had deferred currency losses occurring subsequent to
October 31, 2003 of $7,863. For tax purposes, such losses will be reflected in
the year ending March 31, 2005.

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, mortgage dollar
rolls, paydown losses, and bond discount and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, and bond discount and
premiums.

7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of securities (excluding short-term securities) for the
period ended September 30, 2004 aggregated $162,001,351 and $166,918,997,
respectively.

8. INVESTMENTS IN THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the
Sweep Money Fund.

9. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 67.13% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities may be unsecured and
subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS

MASSACHUSETTS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING

On September 20, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. (Franklin Resources, Inc. and
its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as the "Company") announced that
an agreement has been reached by two of its subsidiaries, Franklin Advisers,
Inc. ("Franklin Advisers") and Franklin Templeton Alternative Strategies, Inc.
("FTAS"), with the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "State of Massachusetts") related to an
administrative complaint filed on February 4, 2004. The administrative complaint
addressed one instance of market timing that was also a subject of the August 2,
2004 settlement that Franklin Advisers reached with the SEC, as described below.

Under the terms of the settlement consent order issued by the State of
Massachusetts, Franklin Advisers and FTAS have consented to the entry of a
cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay a $5 million administrative fine to the
State of Massachusetts. The consent order has multiple sections, including
"Statements of Fact" and "Violations of Massachusetts Securities Laws." The
Company admitted the "Statements of Fact." The Company did not admit or deny the
"Violations of the Massachusetts Securities Laws." While Franklin Advisers and
FTAS did not admit or deny engaging in any wrongdoing, the Company believes that
it is in its best interest and the interests of its funds' shareholders to
settle this issue now and move forward.

On October 25, 2004, the State of Massachusetts filed an administrative
complaint against Franklin Resources, Inc. ("FRI") alleging a violation of the
Massachusetts Uniform Securities law (the "Act") in connection with having filed
on September 20, 2004, an allegedly false and misleading report on Form 8-K with
the SEC. The Massachusetts administrative complaint seeks an order calling for
FRI to cease and desist from further violations of the Act and to pay an
administrative fine in an amount to be determined.

FRI's SEC filing of September 20, 2004 described the settlement consent order
with the State of Massachusetts and reported while "Franklin Advisers and FTAS
did not admit or deny engaging in any wrongdoing, the Company believes that it
is in the best interest of the Company and its funds' shareholders to settle
this issue now and move forward." The October 25, 2004 State of Massachusetts
administrative complaint alleges that this description of the settlement consent
order was materially false and misleading under Massachusetts law. FRI's
management disagrees with the allegation made in this administrative complaint
and continues to believe that the description of the terms of the settlement
consent order issued by the State of Massachusetts is neither false nor
misleading.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) SETTLEMENT

On August 2, 2004, the Company announced that an agreement has been reached by
Franklin Advisers with the SEC that resolves the issues resulting from the SEC's
investigation of market timing activity and the SEC issued an "Order instituting
administrative and cease-and-desist

proceedings pursuant to sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940 and sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
making findings and imposing remedial sanctions and a cease-and-desist order"
(the "Order"). The SEC's Order concerns the activities of a limited number of
third parties that ended in 2000 and those that are the subject of the
Massachusetts administrative complaint described above.

Under the terms of the SEC's Order, pursuant to which Franklin Advisers neither
admits nor denies any wrongdoing, Franklin Advisers has agreed to pay $50
million, of which $20 million is a civil penalty, to be distributed to
shareholders of certain funds in accordance with a plan to be developed by an
Independent Distribution Consultant. At this time, it is unclear which funds
will receive distributions or which shareholders of any particular fund will
receive distributions. The SEC Order also requires Franklin Advisers to, among
other things, enhance and periodically review compliance policies and
procedures.

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

As part of ongoing investigations by the SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern
District of California, the New York Attorney General, the California Attorney
General, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, the Florida
Department of Financial Services and the Commissioner of Securities, the West
Virginia Attorney General, the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance,
Securities, and Health Care Administration and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and payments to securities dealers who
sell fund shares, the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current
or former executives and employees of the Company, have received requests for
information and/or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company and
its current employees have been providing documents and information in response
to these requests and subpoenas. In addition, the Company has responded to
requests for similar kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of
the foreign countries where the Company conducts its global asset management
business.

The staff of the SEC has also informed the Company that it is considering
recommending a civil action or proceeding against Franklin Advisers and Franklin
Templeton Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI") concerning payments to securities dealers
who sell fund shares (commonly referred to as "revenue sharing"). The staff of
the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO") also has advised the Company
that the California Attorney General is authorized to bring a civil action
against the Company and FTDI arising from the same events. Even though the
Company currently believes that the charges the SEC staff and CAGO staff are
contemplating are unwarranted, it also believes that it is in the best interest
of the Company's and funds' shareholders to resolve these issues voluntarily, to
the extent the Company can reasonably do so. The Company continues to have
discussions towards resolving these governmental investigations.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Fund, in addition to other entities within Franklin Templeton Investments,
including certain of its subsidiaries, other funds, and current and former
officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits in
different federal courts in Nevada, California, Illinois, New York and Florida,
alleging violations of various federal securities laws and seeking, among other
things, monetary damages and costs. Specifically, the lawsuits claim breach of
duty with respect to alleged arrangements to permit market timing and/or late
trading activity, or breach of duty with respect to the valuation of the
portfolio securities of certain funds managed by Company subsidiaries, resulting
in alleged market timing activity. The majority of these lawsuits duplicate, in
whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the Massachusetts administrative
complaint described above. The lawsuits are styled as class actions or
derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or the Company.

Various subsidiaries of the Company have also been named in multiple lawsuits
filed in state courts in Illinois alleging breach of duty with respect to
valuation of the portfolio securities of certain funds managed by such
subsidiaries.

In addition, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, as well as certain
current and former officers, employees, and directors have been named in
multiple lawsuits alleging violations of various securities laws and pendent
state law claims relating to the disclosure of directed brokerage payments
and/or payment of allegedly excessive advisory, commission, and distribution
fees. These lawsuits are styled as class actions and derivative actions brought
on behalf of certain funds.

The Company's management strongly believes that the claims made in each of these
lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of the foregoing
governmental investigations or class actions or other lawsuits. If the Company
finds that it bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct
that caused losses to the Fund, it is committed to making the Fund or its
shareholders whole, as appropriate.

                           FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS AND PURPOSE OF THE CODE
      This code of ethics (the "Code")1 is for the investment companies within
the complex registered with the United States Securities & Exchange Commission
("SEC") (collectively, "FT Funds") applies to each FT Fund's Principal Executive
Officers, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (the
"Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

o     Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
      apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
      relationships;

o     Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
      documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
      other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

o     Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o     The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
      appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and
o     Accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
      INTEREST

      OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered
Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or his
service to, the FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise
if a Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper
personal benefits as a result of his position with the FT Funds.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

o     Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
      influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the FT Funds
      whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
      the FT Funds;

o     Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
      individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
      the FT Funds;

o     Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
      Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
      are made in good faith;

o     Report at least annually the following affiliations or other
      relationships:2

o     all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
      required to file reports with the SEC;

o     any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
      directors;

o     any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public
      accounting firm; and

o     any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
      that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
      the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
      affiliates of Franklin Resources).

      There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include3:

o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;

o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
  has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
  business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and
  not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety. Notwithstanding the
  foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior approval for any
  entertainment with a value in excess of $1000.

o Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
  with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
  adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
  thereof;

o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
  charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
  transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
  arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
  equity ownership.

  FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

o     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
      requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

o     Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
      misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
      outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
      and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

o     Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
      responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the FT Funds,
      the adviser and the administrator with the goal of promoting full, fair,
      accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
      documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
      public communications made by the FT Funds; and

o     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
      with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
      regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Each Covered Officer must:

o     Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
      Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
      read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

o     Annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
      requirements of the Code; and

o     Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he knows
      of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself is a violation
      of this Code.

      FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.4
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers5 sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.

      The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

o     FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
      action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;

o     If, after such investigation, FT's General Counsel or Deputy General
      Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, FT's General Counsel is
      not required to take any further action;

o     Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
      a violation will be reported to the Independent Directors of the
      appropriate FT Fund;

o     If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it will
      inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate Funds,
      which will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
      appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
      notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
      board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

o     The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
      appropriate; and

o     Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
      disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies there under. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act and more
detailed policies and procedures set forth in FT's Employee Handbook are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.

VI.   AMENDMENTS
      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.

VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY
      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE
      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the FT Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

officers are employed by the registrant or a third party. If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual report; (2) post the text of the code on its Internet website and
disclose, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3) undertake in
its most recent report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person without charge,
upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which such request
may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or waivers (including
implicit waivers) from, a provision of the code in the registrant's annual
report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant intends to satisfy the
requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting such information on
its website, it will be required to disclose its Internet address and this
intention.

2 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships may be made separately
by completing the Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel. 3 Any activity or relationship that
would present a conflict for a Covered
  Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a
  member of the Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity
  or has such a relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written
  approval by FT's General Counsel in such situations.

4 FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult, as
appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so. 5 Item 2 of
Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
  a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
  waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
  action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from
  a provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
  officer" of the registrant.

materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting;
and

      (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.
