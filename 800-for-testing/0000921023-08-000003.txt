 Dear Shareowner,
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Staying diversified and keeping your portfolio invested in the markets are two
general investment principles that have served investors well over time. They
were particularly useful guides in recent months, when an otherwise healthy
long-term bull market was buffeted by problems in the mortgage and banking
industries.

Since mid-year 2007, issues tied to poor underwriting practices in the subprime
sector of the mortgage industry and to problems with risk management by banks
and hedge funds have resulted in increased market volatility and rising concern
about risks to U.S. economic growth.

U.S. economic growth had slowed over the past two years, but this has been due
as much to the natural maturation of the cyclical expansion, as U.S. factories
approached full utilization and the labor market approached full employment, as
to rising commodity prices or short-term interest rates. This slowdown was,
therefore, not entirely unwelcome, as it reduced the threat of higher
inflation. More recently, however, there has been increasing concern that
falling home prices, and/or disruptions in financial markets pose a larger
threat to continuing economic growth, and we have seen two cuts in short-term
interest rates from the Federal Reserve despite strong economic growth in the
second and third quarters of 2007. A weaker U.S. dollar has put upward pressure
on some prices, but it has also significantly benefited exporters and companies
competing in the global marketplace, stimulating U.S. economic growth.

Economic growth in the rest of the world remains relatively positive. In
Europe, solid GDP growth has driven unemployment lower and supported growing
consumption, although concerns about the impact of the strong Euro are a
persistent source of worry. Japanese economic growth continues, albeit at a
muted rate, and the country's deflationary problems are gradually receding.
Economic growth in emerging market countries remains faster than in the
developed world, led by China, which continues its rise as a world economic
power.

Looking forward, we believe the economic outlook remains generally positive,
although real estate prices, subprime mortgage defaults, and the possibility of
a liquidity/credit crunch represent growing sources of risk. Central banks have
responded to the stresses in the inter-bank and commercial paper markets by
acting as "lenders of last resort" and, in the case of the Federal Reserve, by
cutting rates.

The U.S. Federal Reserve and the world's other central banks are still pursuing
policies aimed at producing low and stable inflation, believed to be the best
backdrop for steady economic growth and low average unemployment over the long
term. Keeping inflation low is also an important support for stock and bond
valuations, and so central bank policies have also been "investor friendly." We
view the Fed's recent rate cuts as temporarily "buying

Letter

insurance" against a credit crunch, which would threaten economic growth,
rather than as an abandonment of its commitment to keeping inflation low.

Even against this wall-of-worry backdrop, and factoring in recent market
weakness, the long-term performance of major asset classes has remained
positive. Equity investors were generally rewarded as, despite several interim
corrections and poor performance in November 2007, the Standard & Poor's 500
Index returned 8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average returned 12%, and the
NASDAQ Composite Index returned 9% in the 12 months ending November 30, 2007.
International developed and emerging markets equities performed even better,
reflecting both a weakening dollar (which boosts returns for U.S. dollar-based
investors) and strong local currency returns, with the MSCI EAFE Developed
Market Index returning 18% and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index returning 46%
over the same period. The U.S. bond market, as measured by the Lehman Aggregate
Bond Index, returned 6% during the period. The U.S. high-yield bond market, as
measured by the Merrill Lynch High Yield Bond Master II Index, returned -3% for
the same period, however, as higher-coupon yields could not compensate for
falling bond prices as credit spreads (differences between yields of higher-
and lower-quality bonds) widened.

Sudden swings in the markets are always to be expected. Just as staying
diversified and invested are important investment principles, it is also
important to pay attention to asset allocation. As always, we encourage you to
work closely with your financial advisor to find the mix of stocks, bonds and
money market assets that is best aligned to your particular risk tolerance and
investment objective.

Respectfully,

/s/ Daniel K. Kingsbury

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value "NAV", due to such factors as
interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold
in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices lower
than their NAV. NAV is total assets less total liabilities, which includes
preferred shares, divided by the number of common shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Trust's dividend
reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of Trust
shares.

Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CSFB Leveraged Loan Index is a
representative index of tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated
loans. The index began in January 1992. Index returns are calculated monthly,
assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any
fees, expenses or sales charges. You cannot invest directly in an index.

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION 11/30/07
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This annual report for Pioneer Floating Rate Trust covers the 12-month period
from December 1, 2006, through November 30, 2007. In the report, portfolio
managers Mark Okada and Joseph Dougherty of Highland Capital Management, the
Trust's sub-adviser, discuss the Trust's investment process, strategy and
outlook.

Q:   How did the Trust perform over the 12 months ended November 30, 2007?

A:   For the 12-month period ended November 30, 2007, Pioneer Floating Rate
     Trust returned 1.65% at net asset value, including reinvestment of
     dividends. The market price return over that same period was -2.02%, and
     the Trust was selling at a discount of market price to net asset value of
     7.1% on November 30, 2007. The Trust's benchmark, the Credit Suisse
     Leveraged Loan Index, returned 2.35% for the 12-month period ended November
     30, 2007. Unlike open-ended funds, a closed-end fund's price goes up and
     down based on market supply and demand, independent of a fund's net asset
     value per share. During the 12 months, the Federal funds target rate (the
     rate banks charge each other for overnight loans) declined to 4.50%; and
     the yield on the 3-month London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) declined to
     4.67%. LIBOR is the rate of interest at which banks in the London interbank
     market borrow funds from each other.

     month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher

Q:   What have been the major contributors to the change in net asset value over
     the period reported?

A:   The change in net asset value for the year ended November 30, 2007, is
     detailed in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets. As can be seen, there
     was a net decrease in net assets of $36.8 million. The major contributors
     to this decrease were net unrealized losses on investments of $45.9 million
     and distributions to shareowners of $59.1 million, offset by Investment
     Income of

     $56.2 million and net realized gains on investments and foreign currency
     transactions of $10.1 million and reinvestment of distributions of $1.9
     million.

Q:   What was the investment environment like for floating-rate securities?

A:   The investment environment over the 12 months ended November 30, 2007 can
     be separated into two distinct periods. During the first half of the fiscal
     year, the environment was stable for floating-rate securities, with new
     issue bank loan volume reaching new highs. Until mid-summer, the leveraged
     loan market appeared to have been unaffected by the negative sentiment in
     the subprime mortgage market. In July, however, the environment changed
     dramatically, as some of the leveraged entities holding subprime assets
     were forced into liquidation to meet margin calls. This resulted in a
     general repricing of other structured products and took enough demand out
     of the market to shut down the new issuance of collateralized loan
     obligations (CLOs), which are a major source of liquidity in the loan
     market. That lack of loan demand, coupled with the large new issue supply,
     contributed to a repricing of corporate loans. We believe the repricing was
     technical in nature not driven by company's fundamentals as illustrated by
     the low default rate. For example, during the summer's repricing, Standard
     & Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data (LCD) reported that the lagging
     12-month default rate on loans remained near an all-time low of 0.42% by
     principal amount and ended November at 0.25%, which is well below the
     Index's historical average of 3.33%. We believe the low default rates
     indicated that the fundamentals in the corporate credit markets were quite
     strong. We viewed the situation as an attractive buying opportunity, as the
     yields rose while prices declined. We feel the market remains oversold as
     spreads (the amount in addition to the reference rate the Trust is paid as
     interest on a position) are wide by historical norms and believe that the
     market is attractive given the fundamental credit environment.

Q:   What were the main strategies used in managing the Trust over the 12-month
     period ended November 30, 2007?

A:   Our strategies were driven by our belief that the economy was healthy and
     that the leveraged loan market represented an attractive long-term
     investment opportunity. We kept the portfolio

8

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     fully invested by using available cash to add newly issued loans that we
     felt would trade higher in the secondary markets. As of November 30, 2007,
     the Trust was well diversified with positions in 178 issuers across 26
     industries. As a percentage of the total invested portfolio, approximately
     93.40% was in loans, 2.10% in equities, 3.40% in bonds and 1.1% in
     temporary cash investments. Approximately 4.71% of the Trust was in second
     lien loans. The largest sector positions in the portfolio were in media and
     telecommunications, health care and retail. Some of the Trust's core
     positions included HCA, a corporate operator of hospitals, and media
     concerns Univision Communications, Tribune and Charter Communications.

     On November 30, 2007, 33.79% of the Trust was leveraged, which means that
     we borrowed funds at low rates and invested those funds in high-yielding
     securities. Over the first half of the fiscal year, short-term rates showed
     little volatility. Later in the fiscal year, however, rates declined which
     lowered the cost of borrowing, providing the Trust with a modest amount of
     additional income. A rise in short-term interest rates in the future would
     add to the Trust's borrowing costs, and the ability to sustain present
     distribution levels could be affected. Due to the floating-rate nature of
     the loan asset class, the coupon payments reset to current LIBOR rates,
     resulting in a correlation between the cost of leverage and the yield
     provided by the Trust's investments. As long as the cost of borrowing
     remains below the coupon rates available to the Trust, we do not anticipate
     that the Trust's investment approach will change.

Q:   Is the Trust invested solely in domestic assets? If not, is anything being
     done to address foreign currency exposure?

A:   No. As of November 30, 2007, the Trust holds 4.6% in international
     investments. However, in an effort to reduce, or offset the effects of
     currency fluctuations, the Trust does participate in currency hedging. The
     effects of this hedging strategy is displayed on the Statement of Assets
     and Liabilities, Statement of Operations, Statements of Changes in Net
     Assets and in Footnote 3 of this annual report.

                                                                               9

Q:   What is your outlook for floating-rate securities and the Trust?

A:   As we move into 2008, we expect the current environment for loans, which
     features larger spreads and low prices relative to historic norms, to
     continue. The widening of spreads on new-issue loans has effectively
     increased the cost of borrowing and is likely to temper the volume of new
     issuance. This situation could lead to a better supply/demand balance later
     in 2008.

     We believe default rates will increase from the historic lows of 2007, but
     given the continued strong EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
     depreciation and amortization) growth rates and relatively benign default
     environment, it is difficult to predict the magnitude of the increase.
     Market consensus is for defaults to approach their historical averages by
     2008 year-end.

     Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is contained
     in the Trust's original offering prospectus. Please refer to this document
     when considering the Trust's risks.

     Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
     greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
     that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

     When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the
     Trust will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall the prices
     of fixed-income securities in the Trust will generally rise. The floating
     rate feature of the Trust means that the Trust will not experience capital
     appreciation in a declining interest-rate environment. Investments in the
     Trust are subject to possible loss due to the financial failure of issuers
     of underlying securities and their inability to meet their debt
     obligations.

     The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
     and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

     The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be
     invested in floating rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be
     illiquid. Illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at a fair
     price at the times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and
     their market price is generally more volatile than that of more liquid
     securities. Illiquid securities are

10
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     also more difficult to value, and investment of the Trust's assets in
     illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of
     market opportunities.

     The Trust currently uses leverage through the issuance of preferred shares.
     The Trust also is authorized to borrow from banks and to issue debt
     securities, which are other forms of leverage. Leverage creates significant
     risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation
     will not be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely
     affect the return for the holders of common shares.

     The Trust is not diversified, which means that it can invest a higher
     percentage of its assets in any one issuer than a diversified fund. Being
     non-diversified may magnify the Trust's losses from adverse events
     affecting a particular issuer.

     Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic
     trends or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future
     performance are statements of the opinion of the Trust's sub-adviser as of
     the date of this report. These statements should not be relied upon for any
     other purposes. Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and
     there is no guarantee that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") is organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The investment objective
of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a
secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent
with its primary goal of high current income.

The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a
developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency
exchange restrictions.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans ("Senior Loans"). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, and high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The
Trust may invest in Senior Loans and other securities of any credit quality,
including Senior Loans and other investments that are rated below investment
grade, or are unrated but are determined by the investment subadviser to be of
equivalent credit quality. Below investment grade securities are commonly
referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These securities involve
greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less
liquid, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities
may be difficult to dispose of at a fair price at the times when the Trust
believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally more
volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities are also more
difficult to value and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
original offering prospectus, with additional information included in the
Trust's shareowner reports. Please refer to those documents when considering
the Trust's risks. At times, the Trust's investments may represent industries
or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making it more
susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or other
risks affecting those industries and sectors.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A.   Security Valuation

    Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Investments in Senior
    Loans are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of
    Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from
    one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation.
    For the limited number of Senior Loans for which no reliable price quotes
    are available, such investments will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
    through the use of pricing matrices to determine valuations.

    Fixed-income securities are valued at prices supplied by independent
    pricing services, which consider such factors as Treasury spreads, yields,
    maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by values obtained
    from dealers and other sources, as required. Equity securities are valued
    at the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded.
    Securities or loans for which quotations are not readily available are
    valued at their fair values as determined by, or under the direction of,
    the Board of Trustees. Trading in foreign securities is substantially
    completed each day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The
    values of such securities used in

                                                                              35
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 11/30/07                             (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are determined as of
    such times. The Trust may also use the fair value of a security, including
    a non-U.S. security, when the closing market price on the primary exchange
    where the security is traded no longer accurately reflects the value of
    the security as of the close of the exchange. Temporary cash investments
    are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value.

    Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
    dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
    passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
    data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Discount and premium on debt
    securities are accreted or amortized, respectively, daily, on an effective
    yield to maturity basis and are included in interest income. Interest
    income, including income on interest bearing cash accounts, is recorded on
    an accrual basis.

    Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
    cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B.   Foreign Currency Translation

    The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
    denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
    current exchange rates.

    Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent,
    among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign currency
    contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference between
    the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
    Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
    investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
    effects of changes in market price of those securities but are included
    with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

    The Trust enters into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
    the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
    future date as a hedge or cross-hedge against either specific investment
    transactions (settlement hedges) or portfolio positions (portfolio
    hedges). All contracts are marked to market daily at the

36
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    applicable exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized gains or losses
    are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records
    realized gains and losses at the time a portfolio hedge is offset by entry
    into a closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency.
    Risks may arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential
    inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contract and from
    unanticipated movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the
    U.S. dollar (see Note 3).

D.   Federal Income Taxes

    It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
    distribute all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if
    any, to its shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
    required.

    The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
    financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal
    income tax rules. Therefore, the source of the Trust's distributions may
    be shown in the accompanying financial statements as either from or in
    excess of net investment income or net realized gain on investment
    transactions, or from paid-in capital, depending on the type of book/tax
    differences that may exist.

    At November 30, 2007, the Trust reclassified $5,215,423 to increase
    undistributed net investment income and $5,215,423 to decrease net
    realized gain on investments to reflect permanent book/tax differences.
    The reclassification has no impact on the net asset value of the Trust and
    presents the Trust's capital accounts on a tax basis.

    The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and
    preferred shareowners during the years ended November 30, 2007 and
    November 30, 2006 were as follows:

     The following shows the components of distributable earnings on a federal
     income tax basis at November 30, 2007.

  Unrealized depreciation            (36,517,316)

                                    ------------
</TABLE>

     The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized depreciation is
     primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
     methods for premiums and discounts on fixed income securities, the
     realization for tax purposes of unrealized losses on certain foreign
     currency contracts and the deferral of post October capital losses for tax
     purposes.

E.   Repurchase Agreements

     With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value
     of the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest
     received from counterparties, is required to be at least equal to or in
     excess of the repurchase agreement at the time of purchase. The collateral
     for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
     account of the Trust's custodian, or subcustodians. Pioneer Investment
     Management, Inc., the Trust's investment adviser is responsible for
     determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to the
     repurchase price.

F.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All common shareowners automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend
     Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), under which participants receive all
     dividends and capital gain distributions (collectively, "dividends") in
     full and fractional common shares of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners
     may elect not to participate in the Plan. Shareowners not participating in
     the Plan receive all dividends and capital gain distributions in cash.
     Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
     resumed at any time without penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer &
     Trust Company, the agent for shareowners in administering the Plan (the
     "Plan Agent"), in writing prior to any dividend record date;

38
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with respect to
     any subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

     Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
     participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
     acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional
     unissued but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
     outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If,
     on the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common share
     is equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated
     brokerage trading fees ("market premium"), the Plan Agent will invest the
     dividend amount in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued
     common shares to be credited to each account will be determined by dividing
     the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per common share
     on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum discount from
     the then current market price per share on the date of issuance does not
     exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend, the net asset value
     per common share is greater than the market value ("market discount"), the
     Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in common shares acquired in
     open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges with respect to newly
     issued common shares. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share
     of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan Agent's
     open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve
     shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be due on
     dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a
     brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to another broker
     and continue to participate in the Plan.

2.   Management Agreement

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("PIM"), a wholly owned indirect subsidiary
of UniCredito Italiano S.p.A. ("UniCredito Italiano") manages the Trust's
portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory Agreement with
PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average
daily managed assets. "Managed assets" is the average daily value of the
Trust's total assets minus the sum of the Trust's liabilities, which
liabilities exclude debt related to leverage, short-term debt and the aggregate
liquidation preference of any outstanding preferred shares. For the year ended

                                                                              39

November 30, 2007, the net management fee was equivalent to 0.70% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.05% of the
Trust's average daily net assets attributable to the common shareowners.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. Included
in "Due to Affiliates" reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities is
$437,124 in management costs, administrative costs and certain other fees
payable to PIM at November 30, 2007.

PIM has appointed Princeton Administrators, LLC ("Princeton") to provide
certain administrative and accounting services to the Trust on its behalf. PIM
pays Princeton a monthly fee equal to 0.07% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed assets in
excess of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly fee of $10,000. Princeton
receives no compensation directly from the Trust.

PIM has engaged Highland Capital Management, L.P. to act as the Trust's
investment sub-adviser ("Sub-adviser") and manage the Trust's investments. PIM
pays the Sub-adviser a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.35% of the average
daily value of the Trust managed assets. The fee is paid monthly in arrears.
The Trust does not pay a fee to the Sub-adviser.

Also, PIM has agreed for the first three years of the Trust's investment
operations to limit the Trust's total annual expenses excluding offering costs
for common and preferred shares, interest expense, the cost of defending or
prosecuting any claim or litigation to which the Trust is a party (together
with any amount in judgment or settlement), indemnification expenses or taxes
incurred due to the failure of the Trust to qualify as a regulated investment
company under the Code or any other non-recurring or non-operating expenses; to
0.95% of the Trust's average daily managed assets. The dividend on any
preferred shares is not an expense for this purpose. For the year ended
November 30, 2007, the Trust's expenses were not reduced under such
arrangements.

3.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into contracts that obligate the Trust to deliver
currencies at specified future dates. At the maturity of a contract, the Trust
must make delivery of the foreign currency. Alternatively, prior to

</TABLE>

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued common shares of beneficial
interest into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As
of November 30, 2007, there were 9,380 AMPS as follows: Series M7-3,130, Series
W7-3,125 and Series TH7-3,125.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. Dividend rates
ranged from 4.95% to 6.45% during the year ended November 30, 2007.

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the outstanding
preferred shares would be less than 200%.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and

42

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Agreement and Declaration of Trust
are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. However, holders of AMPS are also entitled to
elect two of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might
otherwise be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any
outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required
to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the
preferred shares and (b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders,
including, among other things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a
closed-end investment company or changes in its fundamental investment
restrictions.

7. New Pronouncements

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released
FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing the Trust's tax returns to determine whether the tax
positions have a "more-likely-than-not" probability of being sustained by the
applicable tax authority. Tax positions deemed to not meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in
the reporting period in which they are realized. Adoption of FIN 48 is required
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all
open tax years as of no later than May 31, 2008. At this time, management is
evaluating the implications of FIN 48 and any impact in the financial
statements has not yet been determined.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 Fair
Value Measurements ("SFAS 157") was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. At this time, management is currently evaluating the implications
of

                                                                              43

SFAS 157 and its impact on the Trust's financial statement disclosures, if any,
has not yet been determined.

8. Subsequent Event

Subsequent to November 30, 2007, the Board of Trustees of the Trust distributed
$0.145 per common share from undistributed net investment income, $0.1736 per
common share additional net investment income, $0.2213 of realized net short
term capital gains and $0.1267 of realized net long term capital gains, all
payable December 20, 2007, to common shareowners of record on December 12,
2007.

Subsequent to November 30, 2007, dividends declared and paid on preferred stock
totaled $1,069,951 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share
series through January 8, 2008.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Trustees and Shareowners of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust"), including the schedule of investments, as of
November 30, 2007, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the periods
indicated therein. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 2007, by correspondence
with the custodian, selling or agent banks and brokers or by other appropriate
auditing procedures where replies from selling or agent banks or brokers were
not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust at November 30, 2007, the results of its operations
for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and financial highlights for each of the
periods indicated therein, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

                                                          /s/ Ernest & Young LLP

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("PIM") serves as the Trust's investment
adviser pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust.
PIM has retained Highland Capital Management, L.P. to serve as the sub-adviser
to the Trust pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement between PIM and Highland
Capital Management, L.P. The Trustees of the Trust, as required by law,
determine annually whether to continue the investment advisory agreement and
the sub-advisory agreement for the Trust.

In connection with their most recent consideration of the investment advisory
and sub-advisory agreements for the Trust, the Trustees received and reviewed a
substantial amount of information provided by PIM and the sub-adviser in
response to requests of the independent Trustees and their independent legal
counsel. The independent Trustees met on a number of occasions with PIM and
also separately with their independent legal counsel to evaluate and discuss
the information provided to them by PIM and the sub-adviser. At a meeting held
on November 13, 2007, based on their evaluation of the information provided by
PIM and the sub-adviser, the Trustees, including the independent Trustees
voting separately, unanimously approved the continuation of the investment
advisory agreement and the sub-advisory agreement for another year.

In considering the continuation of the investment advisory agreement and the
sub-advisory agreement, the Trustees considered various factors that they
determined were relevant, including the factors described below. The Trustees
did not identify any single factor as the controlling factor in determining to
approve the continuation of the agreements.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services
The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services provided
by PIM and the sub-adviser to the Trust, taking into account the investment
objective and strategy of the Trust and the information related to the Trust
provided to the Trustees at each quarterly meeting. The Trustees reviewed the
terms of the investment advisory agreement and the sub-advisory agreement. The
Trustees also reviewed the sub-advisor's investment approach for the Trust and
its research process. The Trustees considered the resources of PIM and the
sub-adviser and the personnel of PIM and the sub-adviser who provide investment
management services to the Trust. They also considered PIM's compliance and
legal resources and personnel.

                                                                              47
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition, the Trustees considered the other services that PIM provides to
the Trust under the investment advisory agreement and that, as administrator,
PIM is responsible for the administration of the Trust's business and other
affairs. It was noted that PIM supervises and monitors the performance of the
Trust's service providers and provides the Trust with personnel (including
officers) as are necessary for the Trust's operations. The Trustees considered
the fees paid to PIM for the provision of such services.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services provided by PIM and the sub-adviser to the Trust were
satisfactory and consistent with the terms of the investment advisory agreement
and the sub-advisory agreement.

Performance of the Trust
The Trustees considered the performance results of the Trust over various time
periods. They reviewed information comparing the Trust's performance with the
average performance of its peer group of funds as classified by Morningstar,
Inc., ("Morningstar") an independent provider of investment company data, and
with the performance of the Trust's benchmark index. The Trustees considered
that the Trust commenced operations on December 28, 2004 and that the Trust's
annualized total return was in the first quintile of its Morningstar category
for the one year period ended June 30, 2007. The Trustees also considered that
the Trust's total return also was in the first quintile of its Morningstar
category for the period six months ending June 30, 2007. (In all quintile
rankings referred to throughout this disclosure, first quintile is most
favorable to the Trust's shareowners. Thus, highest relative performance would
be first quintile and lowest relative expenses would also be first quintile.)
The Trustees concluded that the investment performance of the Trust was
satisfactory over its short period of operation.

Management Fee and Expenses
The Trustees considered information on the fees and expenses of the Trust in
comparison to the management fees and the expense ratios of a peer group of
funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the independent Trustees
for this purposes using data provided by Strategic Insight Mutual Trust
Research and Consulting, LLC (Strategic Insight), an independent third party.
The Trustees also considered

48
<PAGE>

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

that PIM, not the Trust, paid the sub-adviser pursuant to the sub-advisory
agreement. The Trustees evaluated both the fee under the sub-advisory agreement
and the portion of the fee under the investment advisory agreement retained by
PIM.

The Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2007 was in the first quintile relative to the management fees
paid by other funds in its Strategic Insight peer group for the comparable
period. The Trustees also considered that the Trust's expense ratio for the
twelve months ended June 30, 2007 was in the third quintile relative to its
Strategic Insight peer group for the comparable period.

The Trustees concluded that the management fee payable by the Trust to PIM, as
well as the fees payable by PIM to the sub-adviser of the Trust, were
reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of services provided, taking
into account the fees charged by other advisers for managing comparable funds
with similar strategies. The Trustees also concluded that the Trust's expense
ratio was reasonable, taking into account the size of the Trust, the quality of
services provided by PIM and the sub-adviser, the investment performance of the
Trust and the contractual expense limitation agreed to by PIM with respect to
the Trust.

Profitability
The Trustees considered information provided by PIM regarding the profitability
of PIM with respect to the advisory services provided by PIM to the Trust,
including the methodology used by PIM in allocating certain of its costs to the
management of the Trust. The Trustees also considered PIM's profit margin in
connection with the overall operation of the Trust. They further reviewed the
financial results realized by PIM and its affiliates from non-fund businesses.
The Trustees considered PIM's profit margins with respect to the Trust in
comparison to the limited industry data available and noted that the
profitability of any adviser was affected by numerous factors, including its
organizational structure and method for allocating expenses. The Trustees
recognized that PIM should be entitled to earn a reasonable level of profit for
the services provided to the Trust. The Trustees concluded that PIM's
profitability with respect to the management of the Trust was not unreasonable.

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT (continued)

Economies of Scale
The Trustees considered the extent to which PIM may realize economies of scale
or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the Trust. Since the Trust is
a closed-end fund and its size is relatively stable at an asset level that was
anticipated when the management fee was initially set, the majority of the
Trustees concluded that economies of scale were not a relevant consideration.

Other Benefits
The Trustees also considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
Trust, other than under the investment advisory agreement, for services
provided by PIM and its affiliates. The Trustees further considered the
revenues and profitability of PIM's businesses other than the fund business.
The Trustees also considered the intangible benefits to each of PIM and the
sub-adviser by virtue of its relationship with the Trust and the other Pioneer
funds. The Trustees concluded that the receipt of these benefits was reasonable
in the context of the overall relationship between each of PIM and the
sub-adviser and the Trust.

Conclusion
After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors,
the Trustees, including all of the independent Trustees, concluded that the
investment advisory agreement between PIM and the Trust and the sub-advisory
agreement between PIM and the sub-adviser, including the fees payable
thereunder, were fair and reasonable and voted to approve the proposed
continuation of each of the investment advisory agreement and sub-advisory
agreement for the Trust.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on
or after May 6, 2003, the effective date of the new SEC pre-
approval rules, the Fund's audit committee is required to
pre-approve services to affiliates defined by SEC rules to the
extent that the services are determined to have a direct
impact on the operations or financial reporting of the Fund.
For the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, there
were no services provided to an affiliate that required the
Fund's audit committee pre-approval.


(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountant's engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The aggregate non-audit fees for the Fund and affiliates, as
previously defined, totaled approximately $17,105 in 2007
and $16,440 in 2006.


(h) Disclose whether the registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrant's investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Fund's audit committee of the Board of Trustees has
considered whether the provision of non-audit services that
were rendered to the Affiliates (as defined) that were not pre-
approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

Item 5. Audit Committee of Listed Registrants

(a) If the registrant is a listed issuer as defined in Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3), state whether
or not the registrant has a separately-designated standing
 audit committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).
If the registrant has such a committee, however designated,
identify each committee member. If the entire board of directors
is acting as the registrants audit committee as specified in
Section 3(a)(58)(B) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(B)),
so state.

The registrant has a separately-designated standing audit
committe eestablished in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).

(b) If applicable, provide the disclosure required by Rule 10A-3(d)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3(d)) regarding an exemption
from the listing standards for audit committees.

describe the policies and procedures that it uses to determine how to vote
proxies relating to portfolio securities, including the procedures that the
company uses when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of its
shareholders, on the one hand, and those of the company's investment adviser;
principal underwriter; or any affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)) and the rules
thereunder) of the company, its investment adviser, or its principal
underwriter, on the other. Include any policies and procedures of the company's
investment adviser, or any other third party, that the company uses, or that are
used on the company's behalf, to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of
                       Pioneer Investment Management, Inc.

                            VERSION DATED July, 2004

                                    Overview

   Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer") is a fiduciary that owes
   each of its client's duties of care and loyalty with respect to all
   services undertaken on the client's behalf, including proxy voting. When
   Pioneer has been delegated proxy-voting authority for a client, the duty of
   care requires Pioneer to monitor corporate events and to vote the proxies.
   To satisfy its duty of loyalty, Pioneer must place its client's interests
   ahead of its own and must cast proxy votes in a manner consistent with the
   best interest of its clients. Pioneer will vote all proxies presented in a
   timely manner.

   The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are designed to complement
   Pioneer's investment policies and procedures regarding its general
   responsibility to monitor the performance and/or corporate events of
   companies that are issuers of securities held in accounts managed by
   Pioneer. Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies summarize Pioneer's position on a
   number of issues solicited by companies held by Pioneer's clients. The
   policies are guidelines that provide a general indication on how Pioneer
   would vote but do not include all potential voting scenarios.

   Pioneer's Proxy Voting Procedures detail monitoring of voting, exception
   votes, and review of conflicts of interest and ensure that case-by-case
   votes are handled within the context of the overall guidelines (i.e. best
   interest of client). The overriding goal is that all proxies for US and
   non-US companies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance
   with Pioneer's policies or specific client instructions. All shares in a
   company held by Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a
   client has given us specific voting instructions on an issue or has not
   delegated authority to us or the Proxy Voting Oversight Group determines
   that the circumstances justify a different approach.

   Pioneer does not delegate the authority to vote proxies relating to its
   clients to any of its affiliates, which include other subsidiaries of
   UniCredito.

   Any questions about these policies and procedures should be directed to the
   Proxy Coordinator.

                             Proxy Voting Procedures

   Proxy Voting Service
   Pioneer has engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
   voting of proxies. The proxy voting service works with custodians to ensure
   that all proxy materials are received by the custodians and are processed
   in a timely fashion. To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service
   votes all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting policies established
   by Pioneer. The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
   Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
   where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
   particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
   guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis. The
   proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
   attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
   appear to involve unusual or controversial issues. Pioneer reserves the
   right to attend a meeting in person and may do so when it determines that
   the company or the matters to be voted on at the meeting are strategically
   important to its clients.

   Proxy Coordinator
   Pioneer's Director of Investment Operations (the "Proxy Coordinator")
   coordinates the voting, procedures and reporting of proxies on behalf of
   Pioneer's clients. The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy
   voting service and, in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy
   voting service, will solicit voting recommendations and instructions from
   the Director of Portfolio Management US or, to the extent applicable,
   investment sub-advisers. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for ensuring
   that these questions and referrals are responded to in a timely fashion and
   for transmitting appropriate voting instructions to the proxy voting
   service. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for verifying with the
   Compliance Department whether Pioneer's voting power is subject to any
   limitations or guidelines issued by the client (or in the case of an
   employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries).

   Referral Items
   From time to time, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
   the Proxy Coordinator that are described by Pioneer's policy as to be voted
   on a case-by-case basis, that are not covered by Pioneer's guidelines or
   where Pioneer's guidelines may be unclear with respect to the matter to be
   voted on. Under such certain circumstances, the Proxy Coordinator will seek
   a written voting recommendation from the Director of Portfolio Management
   US. Any such recommendation will include: (i) the manner in which the
   proxies should be voted; (ii) the rationale underlying any such decision;
   and (iii) the disclosure of any contacts or communications made between
   Pioneer and any outside parties concerning the proxy proposal prior to the
   time that the voting instructions are provided. In addition, the Proxy
   Coordinator will ask the Compliance Department to review the question for
   any actual or apparent conflicts of interest as described below under
   "Conflicts of

                                       2
<PAGE>

   Interest." The Compliance Department will provide a "Conflicts of Interest
   Report," applying the criteria set forth below under "Conflicts of
   Interest," to the Proxy Coordinator summarizing the results of its review.
   In the absence of a conflict of interest, the Proxy Coordinator will vote
   in accordance with the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US.

   If the matter presents a conflict of interest for Pioneer, then the Proxy
   Coordinator will refer the matter to the Proxy Voting Oversight Group for a
   decision. In general, when a conflict of interest is present, Pioneer will
   vote according to the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US where such recommendation would go against Pioneer's interest
   or where the conflict is deemed to be immaterial. Pioneer will vote
   according to the recommendation of its proxy voting service when the
   conflict is deemed to be material and the Pioneer's internal vote
   recommendation would favor Pioneer's interest, unless a client specifically
   requests Pioneer to do otherwise. When making the final determination as to
   how to vote a proxy, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will review the
   report from the Director of Portfolio Management US and the Conflicts of
   Interest Report issued by the Compliance Department.

   Conflicts of Interest
   A conflict of interest occurs when Pioneer's interests interfere, or appear
   to interfere with the interests of Pioneer's clients. Occasionally, Pioneer
   may have a conflict that can affect how its votes proxies. The conflict may
   be actual or perceived and may exist when the matter to be voted on
   concerns:

       o      An affiliate of Pioneer,  such as another company  belonging to
              the UniCredito  Italiano  S.p.A.  banking group (a "UniCredito
              Affiliate");

       o      An issuer of a security for which Pioneer acts as a sponsor,
              advisor, manager, custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or
              other similar capacity (including those securities specifically
              declared by PGAM to present a conflict of interest for Pioneer);

       o      An issuer of a security for which UniCredito has informed Pioneer
              that a UniCredito Affiliate acts as a sponsor, advisor, manager,
              custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or other similar
              capacity; or

       o      A person with whom Pioneer (or any of its affiliates) has an
              existing, material contract or business relationship that was not
              entered into in the ordinary course of Pioneer's business.

       o      Pioneer will abstain from voting with respect to companies
              directly or indirectly owned by UniCredito Italiano Group, unless
              otherwise directed by a client. In addition, Pioneer will inform
              PGAM Global Compliance and the PGAM Independent Directors before
              exercising such rights.

   Any associate involved in the proxy voting process with knowledge of any
   apparent or actual conflict of interest must disclose such conflict to the
   Proxy Coordinator and the Compliance Department. The Compliance Department
   will review each item referred to Pioneer to determine whether an actual or
   potential conflict of interest with Pioneer exists in connection with the
   proposal(s) to be voted upon. The review will be conducted by comparing the
   apparent parties affected by the proxy proposal being

                                       3
<PAGE>

   voted upon against the Compliance Department's internal list of interested
   persons and, for any matches found, evaluating the anticipated magnitude
   and possible probability of any conflict of interest being present. For
   each referral item, the determination regarding the presence or absence of
   any actual or potential conflict of interest will be documented in a
   Conflicts of Interest Report to the Proxy Coordinator.

   Securities Lending
   In conjunction with industry standards Proxies are not available to be
   voted when the shares are out on loan through either Pioneer's lending
   program or a client's managed security lending program. However, Pioneer
   will reserve the right to recall lent securities so that they may be voted
   according to the Pioneer's instructions. If a portfolio manager would like
   to vote a block of previously lent shares, the Proxy Coordinator will work
   with the portfolio manager and Investment Operations to recall the
   security, to the extent possible, to facilitate the vote on the entire
   block of shares.

   Share-Blocking

   "Share-blocking" is a market practice whereby shares are sent to a
   custodian (which may be different than the account custodian) for record
   keeping and voting at the general meeting. The shares are unavailable for
   sale or delivery until the end of the blocking period (typically the day
   after general meeting date).

   Pioneer will vote in those countries with "share-blocking." In the event a
   manager would like to sell a security with "share-blocking", the Proxy
   Coordinator will work with the Portfolio Manager and Investment Operations
   Department to recall the shares (as allowable within the market time-frame
   and practices) and/or communicate with executing brokerage firm. A list of
   countries with "share-blocking" is available from the Investment Operations
   Department upon request.

   Record Keeping
   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that Pioneer's proxy voting service:

       o   Retains a copy of the proxy statement received (unless the proxy
           statement is available from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
           Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system);

       o   Retains a record of the vote cast;

       o   Prepares Form N-PX for filing on behalf of each client that is a
           registered investment company; and

       o   Is able to promptly provide Pioneer with a copy of the voting
           record upon its request.

                                       4
<PAGE>

   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that for those votes that may require
   additional documentation (i.e. conflicts of interest, exception votes and
   case-by-case votes) the following records are maintained:

       o    A record memorializing the basis for each referral vote cast;

       o    A copy of any document created by Pioneer that was material in
            making the decision on how to vote the subject proxy; and

       o    A copy of any conflict notice, conflict consent or any other
            written communication (including emails or other electronic
            communications) to or from the client (or in the case of an
            employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries)
            regarding the subject proxy vote cast by, or the vote
            recommendation of, Pioneer.

       o    Pioneer shall maintain the above records in the client's file for a
            period not less than ten (10) years.

     Disclosure
     Pioneer shall take reasonable measures to inform its clients of the process
     or procedures clients must follow to obtain information regarding how
     Pioneer voted with respect to assets held in their accounts. In addition,
     Pioneer shall describe to clients its proxy voting policies and procedures
     and will furnish a copy of its proxy voting policies and procedures upon
     request. This information may be provided to clients through Pioneer's Form
     ADV (Part II) disclosure, by separate notice to the client, or through
     Pioneer's website.

     Proxy Voting Oversight Group
     The members of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group are Pioneer's: Director of
     Portfolio Management US, Head of Investment Operations, and Director of
     Compliance. Other members of Pioneer will be invited to attend meetings and
     otherwise participate as necessary. The Head of Investment Operations will
     chair the Proxy Voting Oversight Group.

     The Proxy Voting Oversight Group is responsible for developing, evaluating,
     and changing (when necessary) Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies and
     Procedures. The group meets at least annually to evaluate and review these
     policies and procedures and the services of its third-party proxy voting
     service. In addition, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will meet as
     necessary to vote on referral items and address other business as
     necessary.

     Amendments
     Pioneer may not amend its Proxy Voting Policies And Procedures without the
     prior approval of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group and its corporate
     parent, Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A

                                       5

   Proxy Voting Policies
   Pioneer's sole concern in voting proxies is the economic effect of the
   proposal on the value of portfolio holdings, considering both the short-
   and long-term impact. In many instances, Pioneer believes that supporting
   the company's strategy and voting "for" management's proposals builds
   portfolio value. In other cases, however, proposals set forth by management
   may have a negative effect on that value, while some shareholder proposals
   may hold the best prospects for enhancing it. Pioneer monitors developments
   in the proxy-voting arena and will revise this policy as needed.

   All proxies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance with the
   specific policies listed below. All shares in a company held by
   Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a client has given us
   specific voting instructions on an issue or has not delegated authority to
   us. Proxy voting issues will be reviewed by Pioneer's Proxy Voting
   Oversight Group, which consists of the Director of Portfolio Management US,
   the Director of Investment Operations (the Proxy Coordinator), and the
   Director of Compliance.

   Pioneer has established Proxy Voting Procedures for identifying and
   reviewing conflicts of interest that may arise in the voting of proxies.

   Clients may request, at any time, a report on proxy votes for securities
   held in their portfolios and Pioneer is happy to discuss our proxy votes
   with company management. Pioneer retains a proxy voting service to provide
   research on proxy issues and to process proxy votes.

Administrative
   While administrative items appear infrequently in U.S. issuer proxies, they
   are quite common in non-U.S. proxies.

   We will generally support these and similar management proposals:

       o    Corporate name change.

       o    A change of corporate headquarters.

       o    Stock exchange listing.

       o    Establishment of time and place of annual meeting.

       o    Adjournment or postponement of annual meeting.

       o    Acceptance/approval of financial statements.

       o    Approval of dividend payments, dividend reinvestment plans and other
            dividend-related proposals.

       o    Approval of minutes and other formalities.

                                       6
<PAGE>

       o    Authorization of the transferring of reserves and allocation of
            income.

       o    Amendments to authorized signatories.

       o    Approval of accounting method changes or change in fiscal year-end.

       o    Acceptance of labor agreements.

       o    Appointment of internal auditors.

   Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case basis on other routine business;
   however, Pioneer will oppose any routine business proposal if insufficient
   information is presented in advance to allow Pioneer to judge the merit of
   the proposal. Pioneer has also instructed its proxy voting service to
   inform Pioneer of its analysis of any administrative items inconsistent, in
   its view, with supporting the value of Pioneer portfolio holdings so that
   Pioneer may consider and vote on those items on a case-by-case basis.

Auditors
     We normally vote for proposals to:

       o    Ratify the auditors. We will consider a vote against if we are
            concerned about the auditors' independence or their past work for
            the company. Specifically, we will oppose the ratification of
            auditors and withhold votes from audit committee members if
            non-audit fees paid by the company to the auditing firm exceed the
            sum of audit fees plus audit-related fees plus permissible tax
            fees according to the disclosure categories proposed by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission.

       o    Restore shareholder rights to ratify the auditors.

     We will normally oppose proposals that require companies to:

       o    Seek bids from other auditors.

       o    Rotate auditing firms, except where the rotation is statutorily
            required or where rotation would demonstrably strengthen financial
            disclosure.

       o    Indemnify auditors.

       o    Prohibit auditors from engaging in non-audit services for the
            company.

     Board of Directors
     On issues related to the board of directors, Pioneer normally supports
     management. We will, however, consider a vote against management in
     instances where corporate performance has been very poor or where the board
     appears to lack independence.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     General Board Issues
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Audit, compensation and nominating committees composed of
            independent directors exclusively.

       o    Indemnification for directors for actions taken in good faith in
            accordance with the business judgment rule. We will vote against
            proposals for broader indemnification.

       o    Changes in board size that appear to have a legitimate business
            purpose and are not primarily for anti-takeover reasons.

       o    Election of an honorary director.

     We will vote against:

       o    Minimum stock ownership by directors.

       o    Term limits for directors. Companies benefit from experienced
            directors, and shareholder control is better achieved through
            annual votes.

       o    Requirements for union or special interest representation on the
            board.

       o    Requirements to provide two candidates for each board seat.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Separate chairman and CEO positions. We will consider voting with
            shareholders on these issues in cases of poor corporate
            performance.

     Elections of Directors
     In uncontested elections of directors we will vote against:

       o    Individual directors with absenteeism above 25% without valid
            reason. We support proposals that require disclosure of director
            attendance.

       o    Insider directors and affiliated outsiders who sit on the audit,
            compensation, stock option or nominating committees. For the
            purposes of our policy, we accept the definition of affiliated
            directors provided by our proxy voting service.

     We will also vote against:

       o    Directors who have failed to act on a takeover offer where the
            majority of shareholders have tendered their shares.

       o    Directors who appear to lack independence or are associated with
            very poor corporate performance.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Re-election of directors who have implemented or renewed a
            dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill (a "dead-hand poison
            pill" is a shareholder rights plan that may be altered only by
            incumbent or "dead " directors. These plans prevent a potential
            acquirer from disabling a poison pill by obtaining control of the
            board through a proxy vote).

       o    Contested election of directors.

       o    Prior to phase-in required by SEC, we would consider supporting
            election of a majority of independent directors in cases of poor
            performance.

       o    Mandatory retirement policies.

       o    Directors who have ignored a shareholder proposal that has been
            approved by shareholders for two consecutive years.

     Takeover-Related Measures
     Pioneer is generally opposed to proposals that may discourage takeover
     attempts. We believe that the potential for a takeover helps ensure that
     corporate performance remains high.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Cumulative voting.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to call special meetings.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to act by written consent.

       o    Restrictions on the ability to make greenmail payments.

       o    Submitting rights plans to shareholder vote.

       o    Rescinding shareholder rights plans ("poison pills").

       o    Opting out of the following state takeover statutes:

     o Control share acquisition statutes, which deny large holders voting
       rights on holdings over a specified threshold.

     o Control share cash-out provisions, which require large holders to
       acquire shares from other holders.

     o Freeze-out provisions, which impose a waiting period on large
       holders before they can attempt to gain control.

     o Stakeholder laws, which permit directors to consider interests of
       non-shareholder constituencies.

                                       9
<PAGE>

     o Disgorgement provisions, which require acquirers to disgorge profits
       on purchases made before gaining control.

     o Fair price provisions.

     o Authorization of shareholder rights plans.

     o Labor protection provisions.

     o Mandatory classified boards.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Fair price provisions. We will vote against provisions requiring
            supermajority votes to approve takeovers. We will also consider
            voting against proposals that require a supermajority vote to
            repeal or amend the provision. Finally, we will consider the
            mechanism used to determine the fair price; we are generally
            opposed to complicated formulas or requirements to pay a premium.

       o    Opting out of state takeover statutes regarding fair price
            provisions. We will use the criteria used for fair price
            provisions in general to determine our vote on this issue.

       o    Proposals that allow shareholders to nominate directors.

     We will vote against:

       o    Classified boards, except in the case of closed-end mutual funds.

       o    Limiting shareholder ability to remove or appoint directors. We
            will support proposals to restore shareholder authority in this
            area. We will review on a case-by-case basis proposals that
            authorize the board to make interim appointments.

       o    Classes of shares with unequal voting rights.

       o    Supermajority vote requirements.

       o    Severance packages ("golden" and "tin" parachutes). We will support
            proposals to put these packages to shareholder vote.

       o    Reimbursement of dissident proxy solicitation expenses. While we
            ordinarily support measures that encourage takeover bids, we
            believe that management should have full control over corporate
            funds.

       o    Extension of advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals.

       o    Granting board authority normally retained by shareholders (e.g.,
            amend charter, set board size).

       o    Shareholder rights plans ("poison pills"). These plans generally
            allow shareholders to buy additional shares at a below-market
            price in the event of a change in control and may deter some bids.

                                       10
<PAGE>

     Capital Structure
     Managements need considerable flexibility in determining the company's
     financial structure, and Pioneer normally supports managements' proposals
     in this area. We will, however, reject proposals that impose high barriers
     to potential takeovers.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Changes in par value.

       o    Reverse splits, if accompanied by a reduction in number of shares.

       o    Share repurchase programs, if all shareholders may participate on
            equal terms.

       o    Bond issuance.

       o    Increases in "ordinary" preferred stock.

       o    Proposals to have blank-check common stock placements (other than
            shares issued in the normal course of business) submitted for
            shareholder approval.

       o    Cancellation of company treasury shares.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Reverse splits not accompanied by a reduction in number of shares,
            considering the risk of delisting.

       o    Increase in authorized common stock. We will make a determination
            considering, among other factors:

     o Number of shares currently available for issuance;

     o Size of requested increase (we would normally approve increases of up to
       100% of current authorization);

     o Proposed use of the additional shares; and

     o Potential consequences of a failure to increase the number of shares
       outstanding (e.g., delisting or bankruptcy).

       o    Blank-check preferred. We will normally oppose issuance of a new
            class of blank-check preferred, but may approve an increase in a
            class already outstanding if the company has demonstrated that it
            uses this flexibility appropriately.

       o    Proposals to submit private placements to shareholder vote.

       o    Other financing plans.

     We will vote against preemptive rights that we believe limit a company's
financing flexibility.

                                      11

     Compensation
     Pioneer supports compensation plans that link pay to shareholder returns
     and believes that management has the best understanding of the level of
     compensation needed to attract and retain qualified people. At the same
     time, stock-related compensation plans have a significant economic impact
     and a direct effect on the balance sheet. Therefore, while we do not want
     to micromanage a company's compensation programs, we will place limits on
     the potential dilution these plans may impose.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    401(k) benefit plans.

       o    Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), as long as shares
            allocated to ESOPs are less than 5% of outstanding shares. Larger
            blocks of stock in ESOPs can serve as a takeover defense. We will
            support proposals to submit ESOPs to shareholder vote.

       o    Various issues related to the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act
            of 1993 (OBRA), including:

     o Amendments to performance plans to conform with OBRA;

     o Caps on annual grants or amendments of administrative features;

     o Adding performance goals; and

     o Cash or cash-and-stock bonus plans.

       o    Establish a process to link pay, including stock-option grants, to
            performance, leaving specifics of implementation to the company.

       o    Require that option repricings be submitted to shareholders.

       o    Require the expensing of stock-option awards.

       o    Require reporting of executive retirement benefits (deferred
            compensation, split-dollar life insurance, SERPs, and pension
            benefits).

       o    Employee stock purchase plans where the purchase price is equal to
            at least 85% of the market price, where the offering period is no
            greater than 27 months and where potential dilution (as defined
            below) is no greater than 10%.

                                       12
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Executive and director stock-related compensation plans. We will
            consider the following factors when reviewing these plans:

       o    The program must be of a reasonable size. We will approve plans
            where the combined employee and director plans together would
            generate less than 15% dilution. We will reject plans with 15% or
            more potential dilution.

            Dilution = (A + B + C) / (A + B + C + D), where

            A = Shares reserved for plan/amendment,

            B = Shares available under continuing plans,

            C = Shares granted but unexercised and

            D = Shares outstanding.

       o    The plan must not:

            o   Explicitly permit unlimited option repricing authority or that
                have repriced in the past without shareholder approval.

            o   Be a self-replenishing "evergreen" plan, plans that grant
                discount options and tax offset payments.

     o We are generally in favor of proposals that increase participation beyond
       executives.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt rigorous
       vesting provisions for stock option plans such as those that vest
       incrementally over, at least, a three- or four-year period with a pro
       rata portion of the shares becoming exercisable on an annual basis
       following grant date.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to disclose their
       window period policies for stock transactions. Window period policies
       ensure that employees do not exercise options based on insider
       information contemporaneous with quarterly earnings releases and other
       material corporate announcements.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt stock holding
       periods for their executives.

       o    All other employee stock purchase plans.

       o    All other compensation-related proposals, including deferred
            compensation plans, employment agreements, loan guarantee programs
            and retirement plans.

       o    All other proposals regarding stock compensation plans, including
            extending the life of a plan, changing vesting restrictions,
            repricing options, lengthening exercise periods or accelerating
            distribution of awards and pyramiding and cashless exercise
            programs.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     We will vote against:

       o    Pensions for non-employee directors. We believe these retirement
            plans reduce director objectivity.

       o    Elimination of stock option plans.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Limits on executive and director pay.

       o    Stock in lieu of cash compensation for directors.

     Corporate Governance
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Confidential Voting.

       o    Equal access provisions, which allow shareholders to contribute
            their opinion to proxy materials.

       o    Proposals requiring directors to disclose their ownership of shares
            in the company.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Change in the state of incorporation. We will support
            reincorporations supported by valid business reasons. We will
            oppose those that appear to be solely for the purpose of
            strengthening takeover defenses.

       o    Bundled proposals. We will evaluate the overall impact of the
            proposal.

       o    Adopting or amending the charter, bylaws or articles of association.

       o    Shareholder appraisal rights, which allow shareholders to demand
            judicial review of an acquisition price.

     We will vote against:

       o    Shareholder advisory committees. While management should solicit
            shareholder input, we prefer to leave the method of doing so to
            management's discretion.

       o    Limitations on stock ownership or voting rights.

       o    Reduction in share ownership disclosure guidelines.

                                       14
<PAGE>

     Mergers and Restructurings
     Pioneer will vote on the following and similar issues on a case-by-case
     basis:

       o    Mergers and acquisitions.

       o    Corporate restructurings, including spin-offs, liquidations, asset
            sales, joint ventures, conversions to holding company and
            conversions to self-managed REIT structure.

       o    Debt restructurings.

       o    Conversion of securities.

       o    Issuance of shares to facilitate a merger.

       o    Private placements, warrants, convertible debentures.

       o    Proposals requiring management to inform shareholders of merger
            opportunities.

     We will normally vote against shareholder proposals requiring that the
     company be put up for sale.

     Mutual Funds
     Many of our portfolios may invest in shares of closed-end mutual funds or
     exchange-traded funds. The non-corporate structure of these investments
     raises several unique proxy voting issues.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Establishment of new classes or series of shares.

       o    Establishment of a master-feeder structure.

     Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case on:

       o    Changes in investment policy. We will normally support changes
            that do not affect the investment objective or overall risk level
            of the fund. We will examine more fundamental changes on a
            case-by-case basis.

       o    Approval of new or amended advisory contracts.

       o    Changes from closed-end to open-end format.

       o    Authorization for, or increase in, preferred shares.

       o    Disposition of assets, termination, liquidation, or mergers.

       o    Classified boards of closed-end mutual funds, but will typically
            support such proposals.

                                       15
<PAGE>

     Social Issues
     Pioneer will abstain on stockholder proposals calling for greater
     disclosure of corporate activities with regard to social issues. "Social
     Issues" may generally be described as shareholder proposals for a company
     to:

       o    Conduct studies regarding certain issues of public concern and
            interest;

       o    Study the feasibility of the company taking certain actions with
            regard to such issues; or

       o    Take specific action, including ceasing certain behavior and
            adopting company standards and principles, in relation to issues
            of public concern and interest.

     We believe these issues are important and should receive management
     attention.

     Pioneer will vote against proposals calling for substantial changes in the
     company's business or activities. We will also normally vote against
     proposals with regard to contributions, believing that management should
     control the routine disbursement of funds.

Potential Conflicts of Interest. When a portfolio manager is responsible for the
management of more than one account, the potential arises for the portfolio
manager to favor one account over another. The principal types of potential
conflicts of interest that may arise are discussed below. For the reasons
outlined below, Pioneer does not believe that any material conflicts are likely
to arise out of a portfolio manager's responsibility for the management of the
fund as well as one or more other accounts. Although Pioneer has adopted
procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to detect and prevent
violations of the federal securities laws and to mitigate the potential for
conflicts of interest to affect its portfolio management decisions, there can be
no assurance that all conflicts will be identified or that all procedures will
be effective in mitigating the potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of
such conflicts of interest are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager
has a financial incentive to favor one account over another. Pioneer has
structured its compensation arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit
such potential for conflicts of interest. The funds investment subadviser also
has adopted certain compliance procedures which are designed to address these
types of conflicts. However, there is no guarantee that such procedures will
detect each situation in which a conflict might arise. See "Compensation of
Portfolio Managers" below.

o       A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in allocating
        new investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial
        public offerings and private placements. If, for example,
        an initial public offering was expected to appreciate in value
        significantly shortly after the offering was allocated to a single
        account, that account may be expected to have better investment
        performance than other accounts that did not receive an allocation of
        the initial public offering. Generally, investments for which there is
        limited availability are allocated based upon a range of factors
        including available cash and consistency with the accounts' investment
        objectives and policies. This allocation methodology necessarily
        involves some subjective elements but is intended over time to treat
        each client in an equitable and fair manner. Generally, the investment
        opportunity is allocated among participating accounts on a pro rata
        basis.  Although Pioneer believes that its practices are reasonably
        designed to treat each client in an equitable and fair manner, there
        may be instances where a fund may not participate, or may participate
        to a lesser degree than other clients, in the allocation of an
        investment opportunity.

o       A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in the order
        in which trades for the accounts are placed.  If a portfolio manager
        determines to purchase a security for more than one account in an
        aggregate amount that may influence the market price of the security,
        accounts that purchased or sold the security first may receive a more
        favorable price than accounts that made subsequent transactions. The
        less liquid the market for the security or the greater the percentage
        that the proposed aggregate purchases or sales represent of average
        daily trading volume, the greater the potential for accounts that make
        subsequent purchases or sales to receive a less favorable price.
        When a portfolio manager intends to trade the same security on the same
        day for more than one account, the trades typically are "bunched," which
        means that the trades for the individual accounts are aggregated and
        each account receives the same price.  There are some types of accounts
        as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons (such
        as directed brokerage arrangements). Circumstances may also arise where
        the trader believes that bunching the orders may not result in the
        best possible price. Where those accounts or circumstances are involved,
        Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result in as
        favorable a price as possible for such client.

o       A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager's
        compensation is tied to the performance of that account to a greater
        degree than other accounts managed by the portfolio manager.  If, for
        example, the portfolio manager receives a bonus based upon the
        performance of certain accounts relative to a benchmark while other
        accounts are disregarded for this purpose, the portfolio manager will
        have a financial incentive to seek to have the accounts that determine
        the portfolio manager's bonus achieve the best possible performance to
        the possible detriment of other accounts.  Similarly, if Pioneer
        receives a performance-based advisory fee, the portfolio manager may
        favor that account, whether or not the performance of that account
        directly determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

o       A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager has
        a beneficial interest in the account, in order to benefit a large client
        or to compensate a client that had poor returns. For example, if the
        portfolio manager held an interest in an investment partnership that was
        one of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager, the portfolio
        manager would have an economic incentive to favor the account in which
        the portfolio manager held an interest.

o       If the different accounts have materially and potentially conflicting
        investment objectives or strategies, a conflict of interest could arise.
        For example, if a portfolio manager purchases a security for one
        account and sells the same security for another account, such trading
        pattern may disadvantage either the account that is long or short.  In
        making portfolio manager assignments, Pioneer seeks to avoid such
        potentially conflicting situations. However, where a portfolio manager
        is responsible for accounts with differing investment objectives and
        policies, it is possible that the portfolio manager will conclude that
        it is in the best interest of one account to sell a portfolio
        security while another account continues to hold or increase the
        holding in such security.



Compensation of Portfolio Managers. Pioneer has adopted a system of compensation
for portfolio managers that seeks to align the financial interests of the
portfolio managers with those of shareholders of the accounts (including Pioneer
funds) the portfolio managers manage, as well as with the financial performance
of Pioneer. The compensation program for all Pioneer portfolio managers includes
a base salary (determined by the rank and tenure of the employee) and an annual
bonus program, as well as customary benefits that are offered generally to all
full-time employees. Base compensation is fixed and normally reevaluated on an
annual basis. Pioneer seeks to set base compensation at market rates, taking
into account the experience and responsibilities of the portfolio manager. The
bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus
compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving superior investment
performance and align the interests of the investment professional with those of
shareholders, as well as with the financial performance of Pioneer. Any bonus
under the plan is completely discretionary, with a maximum annual bonus that may
be in excess of base salary. The annual bonus is based upon a combination of the
following factors:

o        Quantitative Investment Performance. The quantitative investment
         performance calculation is based on pre-tax investment performance of
         all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which
         includes the fund and any other accounts managed by the portfolio
         manager) over a one-year period (20% weighting) and four-year period
         (80% weighting), measured for periods ending on December 31. The
         accounts, which include the fund, are ranked against a group of mutual
         funds with similar investment objectives and investment focus (60%)
         and a broad-based securities market index measuring the performance of
         the same type of securities in which the accounts invest (40%), which,
         in the case of the fund, is the CSFB Leveraged Loan Index.  As a
         result of these two benchmarks, the performance of the portfolio
         manager for compensation purposes is measured against the criteria that
         are relevant to the portfolio manager's competitive universe.
o        Qualitative Performance. The qualitative performance component with
         respect to all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager
         includes objectives, such as effectiveness in the areas of teamwork,
         leadership, communications and marketing, that are mutually established
         and evaluated by each portfolio manager and management.
o        Pioneer Results and Business Line Results. Pioneer's financial
         performance, as well as the investment performance of its investment
         management group, affect a portfolio manager's actual bonus by a
         leverage factor of plus or minus (+/-) a predetermined percentage.

The quantitative and qualitative performance components comprise 80% and 20%,
respectively, of the overall bonus calculation (on a pre-adjustment basis). A
portion of the annual bonus is deferred for a specified period and may be
invested in one or more Pioneer funds.

Certain portfolio managers may participate in other programs designed to reward
and retain key contributors. Senior executives or other key employees may be
granted performance units based on the stock price performance of UniCredito
Italiano and the financial performance of Pioneer Global Asset Management
S.p.A., which are affiliates of Pioneer. Portfolio managers also may participate
in a deferred compensation program, whereby deferred amounts are invested in one
or more Pioneer funds.

Share Ownership by Portfolio Manager. The following table indicates as of
November 30, 2007 the value, within the indicated range, of shares beneficially
owned by the portfolio manager of the fund.

Investment Company and Affiliated Purchasers.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company,
in the following tabular format, provide the information specified in
paragraph (b) of this Item with respect to any purchase made by or on
behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser, as defined in
Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of
shares or other units of any class of the registrants equity securities
that is registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781). Instruction to paragraph (a). Disclose
all purchases covered by this Item, including purchases that do not
satisfy the conditions of the safe harbor of Rule 10b-18 under the
Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18), made in the period covered by the
report. Provide disclosures covering repurchases made on a monthly basis.
For example, if the reporting period began on January 16 and ended on
July 15, the chart would show repurchases for the months from January 16
through February 15, February 16 through March 15, March 16 through
April 15, April 16 through May 15, May 16 through June 15, and June 16
through July 15.

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases
made by or on behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser
as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the Exchange Act), of shares of the registrants equity
securities that are registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.


Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Describe any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrants board of directors, where
those changes were implemented after the registrant last provided
disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G)
of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item.


There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the
shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrants board of
directors since the registrant last provided disclosure in response
to the requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14(A) in
its definitive proxy statement, or this Item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive officer or
officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing
similar functions, about the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the
disclosure required by this paragraph.

The registrant's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have
concluded that the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective based
on their evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days of the
filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose whether or not there were significant changes in the registrant's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these
controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

There were no significant changes in the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the second
fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(a) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant intends to
satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an exhibit.



(b) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2 under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-2).

Filed herewith.
