NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C. (formerly Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.)
         (the "Company") was organized as a limited  liability company under the
         laws of Delaware in January 1999.  The Company is registered  under the
         Investment  Company  act  of  1940,  as  amended,   (the  "Act")  as  a
         closed-end,   non-diversified   management   investment  company.   The
         Company's term is perpetual unless the Company is otherwise  terminated
         under the terms of the Limited Liability  Agreement dated as of June 5,
         2003. The Company's  investment objective is to achieve maximum capital
         appreciation.  It pursues  this  objective  by actively  investing in a
         portfolio  consisting  primarily  of equity  securities  of  technology
         companies  and of  companies  which  derive  a major  portion  of their
         revenue directly or indirectly from technological  events and advances.
         The  Company's  portfolio  of  securities  in the  technology  area  is
         expected  to  include  long and  short  positions  primarily  in equity
         securities of U.S. and non-U.S.  companies.  Equity securities  include
         common  and  preferred  stock  and  other   securities   having  equity
         characteristics,  including convertible debt securities, stock options,
         warrants and rights.

         Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of the
         operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
         Board of Managers of the Company  ("Board of Managers").  There are six
         members  of the  Board  of  Managers  and an  investment  adviser.  The
         Company's investment adviser is Advantage Advisers Management,  L.L.C.,
         a Delaware  limited  liability  company (the "Adviser") a subsidiary of
         Oppenheimer  Asset  Management,   Inc.  ("OAM")  and  an  affiliate  of
         Fahnestock & Co. Inc.  ("Fahnestock").  The Adviser is responsible  for
         managing the Company's investment  activities pursuant to an investment
         advisory  agreement  dated June 5, 2003. OAM is the managing member and
         controlling  person of the Adviser.  Effective  January 1, 2002,  Takis
         Sparaggis  assumed the position of Managing  Director of Alkeon Capital
         Management,  L.L.C. ("Alkeon"), a new investment advisory firm. Subject
         to the  oversight of the  Adviser,  Mr.  Sparaggis  serves as portfolio
         manager  of the  Company,  and Alkeon was  admitted  as a  non-managing
         member of the Adviser.  Fahnestock is a minority joint venture  partner
         in Alkeon.

         On December 10, 2002,  Canadian  Imperial Bank of Commerce,  CIBC World
         Markets Corp.  ("CIBC WM"),  Fahnestock and  Fahnestock  Viner Holdings
         Inc.  ("FVH")  announced that  Fahnestock and FVH had agreed to acquire
         the U.S. brokerage and asset management  business of CIBC WM, including
         the Adviser.  The acquisition of the U.S.  brokerage business closed on
         January  3,  2003.  Consummation  of the  acquisition  of  the  Adviser
         constituted  an assignment of the  Company's  then existing  investment
         advisory agreement. The Board of Managers of the Company approved a new
         investment  advisory agreement between the Company and the Adviser at a
         meeting  held on January  24,  2003 and the  Members  approved  the new
         investment  advisory  agreement at a special meeting of Members held on
         May 5, 2003.  The  acquisition  by Fahnestock and FVH of CIBC WM's U.S.
         asset management business was completed on June 4, 2003.

         The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members is
         subject to approval by the Board of Managers. The Company may from time
         to time offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant to written  tenders by
         Members.  Such repurchases will be made at such times and on such terms
         as may

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)(CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

         be determined by the Board of Managers, in their complete and exclusive
         discretion. The Adviser expects that generally it will recommend to the
         Board of Managers that the Company offer to repurchase  interests  from
         Members  twice each  year,  effective  at the end of the second  fiscal
         quarter and again at the end of the year.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser
         to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
         the financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes
         that the  estimates  utilized  in  preparing  the  Company's  financial
         statements are reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could
         differ from these estimates.

         A.   REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,  are
         recorded on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
         ex-dividend  date, net of applicable  withholding  taxes.  Premiums and
         discounts on fixed income  securities are amortized using the effective
         interest rate method.

         B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Company's securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted
         by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

         Domestic  exchange  traded or NASDAQ listed equity  securities  will be
         valued at their last composite sale prices as reported on the exchanges
         where such  securities are traded.  If no sales of such  securities are
         reported on a particular  day, the securities will be valued based upon
         their composite bid prices for securities held long, or their composite
         asked prices for securities  sold,  not yet  purchased,  as reported by
         such exchanges. Securities traded on a foreign securities exchange will
         be  valued  at their  last  sale  prices  on the  exchange  where  such
         securities are primarily  traded,  or in the absence of a reported sale
         on a  particular  day,  at their bid prices (in the case of  securities
         held long) or asked  prices (in the case of  securities  sold,  not yet
         purchased) as reported by such exchange.  Listed options will be valued
         at their  bid  prices  (or asked  prices in the case of listed  options
         sold,  not yet  purchased) as reported by the exchange with the highest
         volume on the last day a trade was reported. Other securities for which
         market  quotations  are readily  available  will be valued at their bid
         prices  (or  asked  prices  in the  case of  securities  sold,  not yet
         purchased)  as obtained  from one or more  dealers  making  markets for
         those  securities.  If market  quotations  are not  readily  available,
         securities  and other assets will be valued at fair value as determined
         in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         Debt  securities  will be  valued  in  accordance  with the  procedures
         described above,  which with respect to such securities may include the
         use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a matrix
         to determine  valuation for normal  institutional size trading units or
         consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
         Managers will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
         provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities with remaining
         maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual  circumstances,  be
         valued at amortized  cost,  so long as such  valuation is determined by
         the Board of Managers to represent fair value.

         All assets and liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
         will be  converted  into U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
         provided by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m.  London  time.
         Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values of
         such  securities  are  determined,  prior to the  close  of  securities
         markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior to
         such close.  On occasion,  the values of such  securities  and exchange
         rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time such values
         or exchange  rates are determined and the time that the net asset value
         of the Company is determined.  When such events  materially  affect the
         values of  securities  held by the  Company  or its  liabilities,  such
         securities and  liabilities  will be valued at fair value as determined
         in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

         C.   CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The company treats all highly-liquid  financial instruments that mature
         within three months as cash equivalents.  At June 30, 2003, $26,359,683
         in cash equivalents was held at PNC Bank.

         D.   INCOME TAXES

         No provision for the payment of Federal, state or local income taxes on
         the profits of the Company will be made.  The Members are  individually
         liable for the income taxes on their share of the Company's income.

         The  Company  has   reclassified   ($2,755,044)   and  $3,195,019  from
         accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized loss on
         investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
         ended  December  31,  2002.  This  reclassification  was  a  result  of
         permanent  book to tax  differences  to reflect as an adjustment to net
         capital  contributed  the  amounts of taxable  income or loss that have
         been  allocated  to the  Company's  Members  and had no  effect  on net
         assets.

     3.  ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         Fahnestock  provides  certain  administrative  services  to the Company
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays

         allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
         of all Members  (but not the Special  Advisory  Account) as of the last

     4.  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

         Due from broker primarily  represents as proceeds from securities sold,
         not yet purchased,  and excess cash held at the prime broker as of June
         30, 2003.

     5.  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that connection,
         borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in
         equity  securities  on margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
         representing  at least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
         respect to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
         respect  to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act  requires  the
         Company  to  satisfy  an  asset  coverage  requirement  of  300% of its
         indebtedness,  including  amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the
         Company  incurs  the   indebtedness.   The  Company  pays  interest  on
         outstanding  margin  borrowings  at an  annualized  rate of LIBOR  plus
         .875%.  The Company  pledges  securities as  collateral  for the margin
         borrowings,  which are  maintained in a segregated  account held by the
         Custodian.  As of June  30,  2003  and for the six  months  ended,  the
         Company had no outstanding margin borrowings.

     6.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK

         In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
         financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with
         off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include options and
         securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,   these  financial
         instruments  represent  future  commitments  to  purchase or sell other
         financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates. Each
         of these financial  instruments contains varying degrees of off-balance
         sheet  risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value of the  securities
         underlying  the financial  instruments  may be in excess of the amounts
         recognized  in  the  statement  of  assets,  liabilities  and  members'
         capital.

         The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts  which, at times,
         may exceed  federally  insured limits.  The Company has not experienced
         any losses in such  accounts  and does not believe it is exposed to any
         significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

         Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company
         to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a liability  to
         purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at  prevailing   prices.
         Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
         Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold,
         not yet purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
         assets, liabilities and members' capital.

         The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays
         a premium  whether or not the option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
         Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value
         should the  counterparty  not perform under the contract.  Put and call
         options  purchased  are  accounted for in the same manner as investment
         securities.

   Options outstanding at

</TABLE>

         When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company
         is recorded as a liability and is subsequently  adjusted to the current
         market value of the option written. If a call option is exercised,  the
         premium  is added  to the  proceeds  from  the  sale of the  underlying
         security in  determining  whether  the  Company has  realized a gain or
         loss.  In writing an option,  the  Company  bears the market risk of an
         unfavorable change in the price of the security or index underlying the
         written option.

         Exercise  of an  option  written  by the  Company  could  result in the
         Company  selling or buying a  security  at a price  different  from the
         current market value.

         During the six months ended June 30, 2003,  there were no  transactions
         in written options.

         half-year (the  registrant's  second fiscal half-year in the case of an
