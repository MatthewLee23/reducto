Dear SHAREHOLDER |

We thank you for your investment in the Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity
Strategy Fund (the "Fund"). This report covers the Fund's performance for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2008. This has been an extraordinarily difficult
time for most investors, and we are disappointed to report that the Fund's
return was negative for the period.

Madison Asset Management, LLC ("MAM"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Madison
Investment Advisors, Inc. ("Madison"), is the Fund's investment manager. Founded
in 1974, Madison is an independently owned firm that, with its affiliates,
manages more than $7 billion in individual, corporate, pension, insurance,
endowment, and mutual fund assets. Claymore Advisors, LLC is the investment
adviser to the Fund.

The Fund's Board of Trustees recently approved a revision to the Fund's
previously effective non-fundamental investment policy that the Fund may invest
up to 10% of the Fund's total assets in securities of other open- or closed-end
investment companies, including ETFs, that invest primarily in securities of the
types in which the Fund may invest directly. The revision to the previously
effective non-fundamental investment policy authorizes the Fund to invest an
unlimited amount of its uninvested cash in shares of money market funds in
accordance with Rule 12d1-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. It is
expected that the revised non-fundamental investment policy will provide the
Fund with additional flexibility in managing its cash balances.

The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide a high level of current
income and current gains, with a secondary objective of long-term capital
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objectives by investing in a
portfolio consisting primarily of high-quality, large-capitalization common
stocks that are, in the view of the Fund's investment manager, selling at a
reasonable price in relation to their long-term earnings growth rates. On an
ongoing and consistent basis, the Fund sells covered call options to seek to
generate a reasonably steady return from option premiums. There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.

Under normal market conditions, the Fund allocates at least 80% of its total
assets to an integrated investment strategy pursuant to which the Fund invests
in a portfolio of equity securities and writes (sells) covered call options on a
portion of the equity securities held in the Fund's portfolio. Pending
investment in equity securities or as covered call options, the assets of the
Fund allocated to its integrated investment strategy are held in cash or cash
equivalents. The Fund invests, under normal market conditions, at least 65% of
its investments in equity securities in common stocks of large-capitalization
issuers that meet the Fund's selection criteria.

All Fund returns cited--whether based on net asset value ("NAV") or market
price--assume the reinvestment of all distributions. For the 12 months ended
December 31, 2008, the Fund provided a total return based on market price of
- -38.12% and a total return of -34.53% based on NAV. As of December 31, 2008, the
Fund's market price of $6.21 represented a discount of 18.72% to NAV of $7.64.
Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

The market value and NAV of the Fund's shares fluctuate from time to time, and
the Fund's market value may be higher or lower than its NAV. The current
discount to NAV may provide

continued

an opportunity for suitable investors to purchase shares of the Fund below the
market value of the securities in the underlying portfolio. We believe that,
over the long term, the progress of the NAV will be reflected in the market
price return to shareholders.

We encourage shareholders to consider the opportunity to reinvest their
distributions from the Fund through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP"),
which is described in detail on page 25 of the Fund's annual report. When shares
trade at a discount to NAV, the DRIP takes advantage of the discount by
reinvesting the quarterly dividend distribution in common shares of the Fund
purchased in the market at a price less than NAV. Conversely, when the market
price of the Fund's common shares is at a premium above NAV, the DRIP reinvests
participants' dividends in newly-issued common shares at NAV, subject to an IRS
limitation that the purchase price cannot be more than 5% below the market price
per share. The DRIP provides a cost-effective means to accumulate additional
shares and enjoy the benefits of compounding returns over time. Since the Fund
endeavors to maintain a steady monthly distribution rate, the DRIP plan
effectively provides an income averaging technique, which causes shareholders to
accumulate a larger number of Fund shares when the market price is depressed
than when the price is higher.

During 2008 the Fund paid quarterly dividends of $0.33 on February 29 and May
30, $0.28 on August 29, and $0.24 on November 28. The latest quarterly dividend
represents an annualized distribution rate of 15.46%, based on the Fund's
closing market price of $6.21 on December 31, 2008. However, there is no
guarantee that this level of distribution will be maintained.

To learn more about the Fund's performance and investment strategy, we encourage
you to read the Questions & Answers section of the report, which begins on page
5. You will find information about MAM's investment philosophy and discipline,
its views on the market environment and how it structured the Fund's portfolio
based on its views.

We appreciate your investment and look forward to serving your investment needs
in the future. For the most up-to-date information on your investment, please

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS |

We at Madison Asset Management, LLC are pleased to address the progress of our
Fund, the Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the "Fund" or
"MCN") for the period ending December 31, 2008. Introduced in July of 2004, the
Fund continues to pursue its objectives by investing in high-quality,
large-capitalization common stocks that are, in our view, selling at a
reasonable price with respect to their long-term earnings growth rates. Our
option-writing strategy seeks to provide a consistent income from option
premiums, which we expect to help achieve our goal of providing a high level of
current income and current gains with a secondary objective of long-term capital
appreciation.

Madison Asset Management, LLC, (MAM) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Madison
Investment Advisors, Inc., with its affiliates, manages more than $7 billion in
individual, corporate, pension, insurance, endowment, and mutual fund assets.

This past year has been an extremely trying one for virtually all equity
portfolios and the Fund has been no exception. While we have always looked to
invest in the equity securities of what we believe to be high-quality companies,
the stock market was indiscriminate in its downslide in 2008 and, although
option income was a positive contributor, we could not maintain the Fund's net
asset value ("NAV") in the past year's environment as it was overshadowed by the
negative equity markets. That said, we should recognize that we invest for the
future and cannot change the past, and we see some encouraging signs for the
Fund. First of all, the potential to generate income from covered call option
writing in 2009 looks as bright now as any time in the Fund's history, and we
like the valuations we are obtaining for the Fund's underlying securities. We
have confidence that the historic, massive interventions in the economy by the
U.S. federal government will eventually gain traction and we should see better
investment returns in 2009 than in 2008.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MARKET OF 2008?
This 12-month period has already been memorialized as one of the worst calendar
years for stocks in history, as the S&P 500 (1) returned -37.0%, its second
worst annual loss in its history. Unlike some previous market drops, such as the
dot. com crash of 2000-2002, this decline was broad and relatively
indiscriminate, affecting all market sectors and capitalization ranges.

Equity indices around the world were negatively impacted in 2008 in the wake of
broad economic problems, while a flight to safety concentrated positive returns
among the most secure assets, primarily securities issued by the U.S. Treasury.
The stock market hit its 2008 peak in January, but it was far from clear at that
time that 2008 was going to be as bad as it turned out. At first, it appeared
that the credit problems sparked by the subprime loan crisis might be contained,
and by May 19, 2008, the market was nipping at new annual highs in the wake of a
bailout plan for investment bank Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. However, as the year
progressed, the problems that began in the subprime mortgage area bloomed into a
full-fledged credit crisis, with the signature event being the collapse of
investment bank Lehman Brothers Inc. in September. The credit crisis sent
unexpected shock waves into virtually all areas of the global economy, sparking
a worldwide economic slowdown and recession. As credit froze, highly leveraged
firms began to experience liquidity problems, and many financial and industrial
firms with household names found themselves on the brink--or over the brink--of
insolvency.

Countering the crisis in the financial sector was a series of significant, even
historically unprecedented, interventions by the U.S. federal government.
Beginning in January 2008, the Federal Reserve implemented the first of a series
of cuts to the target Federal Funds Rate, which by December 2008 had been
lowered to a range of 0% to 0.25%, the lowest in modern history. In addition to
rate cuts, the U.S. federal government has injected massive stimulus into the
financial system in order to provide a solid base from which to repair balance
sheets and normalize credit markets. These interventions made headlines
throughout the year, including the bailout of Bear Stearns, what amounted to a
federal acquisition of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the
Congressional creation of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. An
additional large stimulus package is expected under the new administration.

continued

The S&P 500 hit its 2008 low on November 20 and rallied into the New Year with a
20% rise off the low, but still closed the year 37% lower than it opened. All in
all, it was one of the most tumultuous years ever for the U.S. financial system
and markets, and the result was widespread fear among investors and considerable
uncertainty about the direction of the U.S. economy.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM GIVEN THE MARKETPLACE CONDITIONS DURING 2008?
We are pleased to report that MCN generated sufficient income in 2008 to return
$1.18 per share to our shareholders in dividends. We continued to find ample
opportunities to write call options at attractive premiums. The Fund's NAV per
share decreased $5.38 in 2008 from $13.02 to $7.64, as most of the Fund's stocks
participated in the market's decline in value in 2008. MCN's market value per
share at year end was $6.21, and the Fund's common shares were trading at an
18.72% discount to NAV at that time.

For 2008, the Fund provided investors with total returns of -34.53% and -38.12%
on an NAV and market price basis, respectively, compared to a return of -37.00%
for the S&P 500. The Fund's benchmark, the CBOE S&P 500 Buy Write Index (the
"BXM"), (2) lost -28.70% in 2008. The Fund's underlying stocks were the main
source of the performance gap between the Fund and the BXM. MCN had its largest
weighting in the consumer discretionary, financial, and technology sectors, all
of which were strongly negative for the period, while the S&P 500's consumer
staples and utility sectors, which were unrepresented in the Fund's portfolio,
were two of the index's three strongest performers in 2008. Currently, we
believe the Fund's portfolio is comprised of high-quality stocks trading at
attractive prices based on a number of valuation metrics.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIBE THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO EQUITY AND OPTION STRUCTURE:
As of December 31, 2008, the Fund held 56 equity securities. Unexpired covered
call options had been written against 96% of the Fund's stock holdings as of
December 31, 2008. During 2008, the Fund generated total premiums of $50.5
million from its covered call writing activities. It is the strategy of the Fund
to write "out-of-the-money" call options; at December 31, the majority of the
Fund's options (about 86%) were still out-of-the-money. (Out-of-the-money means
the stock price is below the strike price at which the shares could be called
away by the option holder.) Since the Fund's option positions are primarily
out-of-the-money, we believe the Fund is well positioned to participate in the
upside should its stock holdings rally.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHICH SECTORS ARE PREVALENT IN THE FUND?
From a sector perspective, MCN's largest exposure as of December 31, 2008 was to
the technology (and technology related) sector, followed by consumer
discretionary, financials, health care and energy. The Fund was not invested in
the materials, consumer staples and utilities sectors as of December 31, 2008.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIBE THE FUND'S DIVIDEND HISTORY FOR THE PERIOD:
In 2008, the Fund declared quarterly dividends of $0.33 per share in February
and May, $0.28 per share in August and $0.24 per share in November. At the
Fund's closing market price of $6.21 per share on December 31, 2008 and at the
latest quarterly rate of $0.24, the Fund's dividend yield was 15.46%.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCUSS THE FUND'S SECURITY AND OPTION SELECTION PROCESS:
The Fund is managed by two teams of investment professionals. We like to think
of these teams as a "right hand" and "left hand" meaning they work together to
make common stock and option decisions. We use fundamental analysis to select
solid companies with good growth prospects and attractive valuations. We then
seek attractive call options to write on those stocks. It is our belief that
this partnership of active management between the equity and option teams
provides investors with an innovative, risk-moderated approach to equity
investing.

ratios (Price-Earnings ratio

to Growth rate) as well as financial strength and industry leadership. As
bottom-up investors, we focus on the fundamental businesses of our companies.
Our stock selection philosophy strays away from the "beat the street" mentality,
as we seek companies that have sustainable competitive advantages, predictable
cash flows, solid balance sheets and high-quality management teams. By
concentrating on long-term prospects and circumventing the "instant
gratification" school of thought, we believe we bring elements of consistency,
stability and predictability to our shareholders.

Once we have selected attractive and solid names for the Fund, we employ our
call writing strategy. This procedure entails selling calls that are primarily
out-of-the-money, meaning that the strike price is higher than the common stock
price, so that the Fund can participate in some stock appreciation. By receiving
option premiums, the Fund receives a high level of investment income and adds an
element of downside protection. Call options may be written over a number of
time periods and at differing strike prices in an effort to maximize the
protective value to the strategy and spread income evenly throughout the year.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS THE MANAGEMENT'S OUTLOOK FOR THE MARKET AND FUND IN 2009?
As we enter 2009, the U.S. economy and most of the world is mired in a severe
recession. It is increasingly difficult to find reason for optimism in upcoming
economic data. U.S. consumer confidence has fallen to generational lows.
Manufacturers are paring back production and employment in anticipation of a
prolonged recession. Unemployment rates are rising and are likely to rise
further, in our opinion. Credit remains tight and is only available to the most
worthy of borrowers.

The process of deleveraging, begun in 2007, will likely continue into 2009 and
beyond. The financial sector deleveraging, while well-advanced, has more room
to run. Private sector corporate deleveraging will likely be a less troublesome
issue, as non-financial corporate balance sheets remain in good shape. The
process of consumer deleveraging, we fear, is still in its early stages, and
should only be magnified as the unemployment rate rises and the recession
deepens.

Despite this, there are bright spots. The monetary and fiscal stimulus brought
to bear thus far is staggering and should eventually produce its intended
effect. Estimates of the U.S. federal government budget deficit for 2009 could
approach $1 trillion. And the $100 decline in the price of a barrel of crude oil
could place up to $260 billion back in consumer's pockets - a large stimulus in
and of itself. After a gloomy first half, we expect the economy to begin to show
signs of life in the second half of 2009.

On the option writing side, the VIX Index (3) spiked as high as 80 in November,
resulting in some of the most attractive option premiums since we launched the
Fund. Going forward, we believe this higher level of volatility will allow us to
earn very attractive option income for the Fund.

      the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index and shows the
      market's expectation of 30-day volatility. It is constructed using the
      implied volatilities of a wide range of S&P 500 index options. This
      volatility is meant to be forward looking and is calculated from both
      calls and puts. The VIX is a widely used measure of market risk and is
      often referred to as the "investor fear gauge."

MCN RISKS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
The views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only
through the report period as stated on the cover. These views are subject to
change at any time, based on market and other conditions and should not be
construed as a recommendation of any kind. The material may also include forward
looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty, and there is no guarantee
that any predictions will come to pass.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.
The value of the Fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying
securities. Historically, closed-end funds often trade at a discount to their
net asset value.

Equity Risk: The value of the securities held by the Funds will fall due to
general market and economic conditions, perceptions regarding the industries in
which the issuers of securities held by the Funds participate, or factors
relating to specific companies in which the Funds invest.

Risks Associated with Options on Securities: There are several risks associated
with transactions in options on securities. For example, there are significant
differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an
imperfect correlation between these markets, causing a given transaction not to
achieve its objectives. A decision as to whether, when and how to use options
involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived
transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or
unexpected events. As the writer of a covered call option, the Fund
forgoes, during the option's life, the opportunity to profit from increases in
the market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the
premium and the strike price of the call but has retained the risk of loss
should the price of the underlying security decline. The writer of an option has
no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a
writer of the option. Once an option writer has received an exercise notice, it
cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its
obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the
exercise price.

Foreign Investment Risk: Investing in non-U.S. issuers may involve unique risks
such as currency, political, and economic risk, as well as less market
liquidity, generally greater market volatility and less complete financial
information than for U.S. issuers.

Risks of Mid-Cap Companies: Mid-cap companies often are newer or less
established companies than larger companies. Investments in mid-cap companies
carry additional risks because earnings of these companies tend to be less
predictable; they often have limited product lines, markets, distribution
channels or financial resources; and the management of such companies may be
dependent upon one or a few key people. The market movements of equity
securities of mid-cap companies may be more abrupt or erratic than the market
movements of equity securities of larger, more established companies or the
stock market in general.

Industry Concent ration Risk: To the extent that the Fund makes substantial
investments in a single industry, the Fund will be more susceptible to adverse
economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those sectors.

Fund Distribution Risk: In order to make regular quarterly distributions on its
common shares, the Fund may have to sell a portion of its investment portfolio
at a time when independent investment judgment may not dictate such action. In
addition, the Fund's ability to make distributions more frequently than annually
from any net realized capital gains by the Fund is subject to the Fund obtaining
exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which cannot be
assured. To the extent the total quarterly distributions for a year exceed the
Fund's net investment company income and net realized capital gain for that
year, the excess will generally constitute a return of the Fund's capital to its
common share-holders. Such return of capital distributions generally are
tax-free up to the amount of a common shareholder's tax basis in the common
shares (generally, the amount paid for the common shares). In addition, such
excess distributions will decrease the Fund's total assets and may increase the
Fund's expense ratio.

Financial Leverage: The Fund is authorized to utilize leverage through the
issuance of preferred shares and/or the Fund may also borrow or issue debt
securities for financial leveraging purposes and for temporary purposes such as
settlement of transactions. Although the use of any financial leverage by the
Fund may create an opportunity for increased net income, gains and capital
appreciation for the Common Shares, it also results in additional risks and can
magnify the effect of any losses. If the income and gains earned on securities
purchased with financial leverage proceeds are greater than the cost of
financial leverage, the Fund's return will be greater than if financial leverage
had not been used. Conversely, if the income or gain from the securities
purchased with such proceeds does not cover the cost of financial leverage, the
return to the Fund will be less than if financial leverage had not been
used. Financial leverage also increases the likelihood of greater volatility of
net asset value and market price of and dividends on the Common Shares than a
comparable portfolio without leverage.

An investment in the Fund includes, but is not limited to, risks and
considerations such as: Investment Risk, Not a Complete Investment Program,
Equity Risk, Risks Associated with Options on Securities, Limitation on Option
Writing Risk, Risks of Mid-Cap Companies, Income Risk, Foreign Securities Risk,
Industry Concentration Risk, Derivatives Risk, Illiquid Securities Risk, Fund
Distribution Risk, Market Discount Risk, Other Investment Companies, Financial
Leverage Risk, Management Risk, Risks Related to Preferred Securities, Interest
Rate Risk, Inflation Risk, Current Developments Risk and Anti-Takeover
Provisions. Please see www.claymore.com/mcn for a more detailed discussion about
Fund risks and considerations.

MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund

Notes to FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | DECEMBER 31, 2008

Note 1 - ORGANIZATION:
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the "Fund") was organized
as a Delaware statutory trust on May 6, 2004. The Fund is registered as a
diversified, closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.

The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide a high level of current
income and current gains, with a secondary objective of long-term capital
appreciation. The Fund will, under normal market conditions, pursue its primary
investment objective by allocating at least 80% of total assets to an integrated
investment strategy pursuant to which the Fund invests in a portfolio of equity
securities consisting primarily of high quality, large capitalization common
stocks that are, in the view of the Fund's investment manager, selling at a
reasonable price in relation to their long-term earnings growth rates and writes
(sells) covered call options against a portion of the equity securities held;
pending investment in equity securities or covered call options, assets of the
Fund allocated to its integrated investment strategy will be held in cash or
cash equivalents. The Fund seeks to produce a high level of current income and
gains through premiums received from writing options and, to a lesser extent,
from dividends. There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its
investment objectives. The Fund's investment objectives are considered
fundamental and may not be changed without shareholder approval.

Note 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund.

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Readily marketable portfolio securities listed on an exchange or traded in the
over-the-counter market are generally valued at their last reported sale price.
If no sales are reported, the securities are valued at the mean of the closing
bid and asked prices on such day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such
day, then the security is valued by such method as the Fund's Board of Trustees
shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair value. Securities traded on
NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. Portfolio securities
traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price at
the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities.
Debt securities are valued at the last available bid price for such securities
or, if such prices are not available, at the mean between the last bid and asked
price. Exchange-traded options are valued at the mean of the best bid and best
asked prices across all option exchanges. Short-term debt securities having a
remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

For those securities whose bid or asked prices are not available, the valuations
are determined in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Valuations in accordance with these procedures are intended
to reflect each security's (or asset's) "fair value". Such "fair value" is the
amount that the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for the security (or
asset) upon its current sale. Each such determination should be based on a
consideration of all relevant factors, which are likely to vary from one pricing
context to another. Examples of such factors may include, but are not limited
to: (I) the type of security, (ii) the initial cost of the security, (iii) the
existence of any contractual restrictions on the security's disposition, (iv)
the price and extent of public trading in similar securities of the issuer or of
comparable companies, (v) quotations or evaluated prices from broker-dealers
and/or pricing services, (vi) information obtained from the issuer, analysts,
and/or the appropriate stock exchange (for exchange traded securities), (vii) an
analysis of the company's financial statements, and (viii) an evaluation of the
forces that influence the issuer and the market(s) in which the security is
purchased and sold (e.g. the existence of pending merger activity, public
offerings or tender offers that might affect the value of the security).

In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.157,"Fair Valuation Measurements"
("FAS 157"). This standard clarifies the definition of fair value for financial
reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires
additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. FAS 157
establishes three different categories for valuations. Level 1 valuations are
those based upon quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 valuations are those
based upon quoted prices in inactive markets or based upon significant
observable inputs (i.e. yield curves; benchmark interest rates; indices). Level
3 valuations are those based upon unobservable inputs (i.e. discounted cash flow
analysis; non-market based methods used to determine fair valuation). Details of
the valuations as of December 31, 2008 were as follows:

================================================================================

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income is recorded net of applicable withholding taxes on the ex-dividend date
and interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on
debt securities purchased are accreted or amortized to interest income over the
lives of the respective securities using the effective interest method.

To earn greater income on otherwise uninvested cash temporarily held by the
Fund, such as income earned from stock sold or called away, stock dividends and
covered call writing premiums, the Fund may invest such cash in repurchase
agreements. Repurchase agreements are short-term investments in which the Fund
acquires ownership of a debt security and the seller agrees to repurchase the
security at a future time and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully
collateralized by the underlying debt security. The Fund will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer
to the account of the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the
value of the underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due
the Fund.

(c) OPTIONS
An option on a security is a contract that gives the holder of the option, in
return for a premium, the right to buy from (in the case of a call) or sell to
(in the case of a put) the writer of the option the security underlying the
option at a specified exercise or "strike" price. The writer of an option on a
security has an obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver the underlying
security upon payment of the exercise price (in the case of a call) or to pay
the exercise price upon delivery of the underlying security (in the case of a
put).

There are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities.
As the writer of a covered call option, the Fund forgoes, during the option's
life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the
security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike
price of the call but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the
underlying security decline. A writer of a put option is exposed to the risk of
loss if fair value of the underlying securities declines, but profits only to
the extent of the premium received if the underlying security increases in
value. The writer of an option has no control over the time when it may be
required to fill its obligation as writer of the option. Once an option writer
has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction
in order to terminate its obligation under the option and must deliver the
underlying security at the exercise price.

(d) DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
The Fund declares and pays quarterly dividends to common shareholders.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount
and timing of distributions are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. These dividends consist of investment company taxable income, which
generally includes qualified dividend income, ordinary income and short-term
capital gains, including premiums received on written options. Realized
short-term capital gains are considered ordinary income for tax purposes and
will be reclassified at the Fund's fiscal year end on the Fund's Statement of
Assets and Liabilities from accumulated net realized gains to distributions in
excess of net investment income. Any net realized long-term capital gains are
distributed annually to common shareholders.

Note 3 - INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND
OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES:
Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Agreement") between the Fund
and Claymore Advisors, LLC (the "Adviser"), the Adviser will furnish offices,
necessary facilities and equipment, provide certain administrative services,
oversee the activities of Madison Asset Management LLC (the "Investment
Manager"), provide personnel, including certain officers required for the Fund's
administrative management and compensate all officers and trustees of the Fund
who are its affiliates. As compensation for these services, the Fund will pay
the Investment Adviser a fee, payable monthly, in an amount equal to 0.50% of
the Fund's average daily managed assets. Managed assets equal the net assets of
the Fund plus any assets attributable to financial leverage.

Pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement between the Fund and the
Investment Manager, the Investment Manager, under the supervision of the Fund's
Board of Trustees and the Adviser, will provide a continuous investment program
for the Fund's portfolio; provide investment research and make and execute
recommendations for the purchase and sale of securities; and provide certain
facilities and personnel, including officers required for the Fund's
administrative management and compensation of all officers and trustees of the
Fund who are its affiliates. As compensation for these services, the Fund will
pay the Investment Manager a fee, payable monthly, in an amount equal to 0.50%
of the Fund's average daily managed assets.

STATEMENTS continued

Under separate Fund Administration and Fund Accounting agreements, the Adviser
provides fund administration services and the Investment Manager provides fund
accounting services to the Fund. The Adviser receives a fund administration fee
payable monthly at the annual rate set forth below as a percentage of the
average daily-managed assets of the Fund:

MANAGED ASSETS                                RATE
- ---------------------------------------------------
First $200,000,000                          0.0275%
Next $300,000,000                           0.0175%
Next $500,000,000                           0.0125%
Over $1,000,000,000                         0.0100%

The Investment Manager receives a fund accounting fee based on the combined net
assets of the Fund and the Madison Strategic Sector Premium Fund, a closed-end
investment company sponsored by the Investment Manager. The fund accounting fee
is allocated on a prorated basis of the net assets of each fund. This fee is
payable monthly at the annual rate set forth below as a percentage of the
average daily net assets of the two funds:

NET ASSETS                                    RATE

First $200,000,000                          0.0275%
Next $300,000,000                           0.0200%
Next $500,000,000                           0.0150%
Over $1,000,000,000                         0.0100%

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund are also officers and directors of
Claymore Advisors, LLC or Madison Asset Management LLC. The Fund does not
compensate its officers or trustees who are officers or interested persons of
the two aforementioned firms.

Note 4 - FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:
The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment companies.
Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes is required. In
addition, by distributing substantially all of its ordinary income and long-term
capital gains, if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends not to be
subject to U.S. federal excise tax.

Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and realized
gains/losses under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and federal
income tax purposes, permanent differences between book and tax basis reporting
have been identified and appropriately reclassified on the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities. A permanent book and tax difference relating to a distribution
reclass in the amount of $22,648,022 was reclassified from accumulated
undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized gain. Net
realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax reporting
primarily as a result of the deferral of losses relating to wash sale
transactions. Information on the components of investments, excluding written
options, and net assets as of December 31, 2008 is as follows:

The Fund adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Interpretation No.48 ("FIN 48") Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes on December 31, 2007. FIN 48 sets forth a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. The implementation of FIN 48 did not result in any
unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements.

FIN 48 requires the Fund to analyze all open tax years. Open tax years are those
years that are open for examination by the relevant income taxing authority. Tax
years ended 2005, 2006 and 2007 remain subject to examination by major
jurisdictions.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note 7 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS:
On April 30, 2008, the Fund entered into a $50,000,000 Revolving Credit
Agreement with M&I Marshall & Ilsley Bank, which provides for a revolving credit
facility to be used as leverage for the Fund. The credit facility provides for a
secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against
advances made to the Fund. The Fund may borrow an amount up to 20% of the Fund's
total assets (including the proceeds of such financial leverage). Interest on
the amount borrowed is based on the 1-month LIBOR plus 1.50%. An unused
commitment fee of 0.10% is charged on the difference between the $50,000,000
credit agreement and the amount borrowed, which is included in "Line of credit
fees" on the Statement of Operations. As of December 31, 2008, there was
$24,000,000 outstanding in connection with the Fund's credit facility. The
average daily amount of the borrowings on the credit facility during the period
ended December 31, 2008 was $12,058,470 with a related average interest rate of
4.29%. The maximum amount outstanding during the period was $ 29,600,000. The
maturity date for the Revolving Credit Agreement is February 28, 2009. If the
Fund is unable to renew the revolving credit facility or find a replacement
facility, the Fund may need to liquidate portfolio securities in an amount
necessary to repay the facility.

Note 8 - INDEMNIFICATIONS:
In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that provide
general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements
is dependent upon claims that may be made against the Fund in the future, and,
therefore cannot be estimated; however, the risk of material loss from such
claims is considered remote.

Note 9 - RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No.161 ("SFAS No.161"),"Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities." This standard is intended to enhance financial statement
disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities and enable
investors to under-stand: a) how and why a fund uses derivative instruments, b)
how derivative instruments and related hedge fund items are accounted for, and
c) how derivative instruments and related hedge items affect a fund's financial
position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS No.161 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
November 15, 2008. As of December 31, 2008, management does not believe the
adoption of SFAS No.161 will impact the financial statement amounts; however,
additional footnote disclosures may be required about the use of derivative
instruments and hedging items.

Note 10 - SUBSEQUENT EVENT:
On February 2, 2009, the Board of Trustees declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.24 per common share. The dividend is payable February 27, 2009 to
shareholders of record on February 13, 2009.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM|

TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF
MADISON/CLAYMORE COVERED CALL & EQUITY STRATEGY FUND

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the "Fund"), including the
portfolio of investments, as of December 31, 2008, and the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the four years in the period then ended and for the period from July 28,
2004 (commencement of investment operations) through December 31, 2004. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of December 31, 2008, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian and brokers or by other applicable auditing procedures where replies
from brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund as of December 31, 2008,
and the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the four years in the period then ended and for the
period from July 28, 2004 (commencement of investment operations) through
December 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Dividend Reinvestment PLAN | (Unaudited)

Unless the registered owner of common shares elects to receive cash by
contacting the Plan Administrator, all dividends declared on common shares of
the Fund will be automatically reinvested by the Bank of New York Mellon (the
"Plan Administrator"), Administrator for shareholders in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), in additional common shares of the Fund.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by notice if received and processed by the
Plan Administrator prior to the dividend record date; otherwise such termination
or resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared
dividend or other distribution. Some brokers may automatically elect to receive
cash on your behalf and may re-invest that cash in additional common shares of
the Fund for you. If you wish for all dividends declared on your common shares
of the Fund to be automatically reinvested pursuant to the Plan, please contact
your broker.

The Plan Administrator will open an account for each common shareholder under
the Plan in the same name in which such common shareholder's common shares are
registered. Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or other distribution
(together, a "Dividend") payable in cash, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common
shares. The common shares will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for the
participants' accounts, depending upon the circumstances described below, either
(i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized common shares from the
Fund ("Newly Issued Common Shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding common
shares on the open market ("Open-Market Purchases") on the New York Stock
Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the closing
market price plus estimated brokerage commission per common share is equal to or
greater than the net asset value per common share, the Plan Administrator will
invest the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares on behalf of the
participants. The number of Newly Issued Common Shares to be credited to each
participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
Dividend by the net asset value per common share on the payment date; provided
that, if the net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the closing market
value on the payment date, the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by
95% of the closing market price per common share on the payment date. If, on the
payment date for any Dividend, the net asset value per common share is greater
than the closing market value plus estimated brokerage commission, the Plan
Administrator will invest the Dividend amount in common shares acquired on
behalf of the participants in Open-Market Purchases.

If, before the Plan Administrator has completed its Open-Market Purchases, the
market price per common share exceeds the net asset value per common share, the
average per common share purchase price paid by the Plan Administrator may
exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting in the acquisition of
fewer common shares than if the Dividend had been paid in Newly Issued Common
Shares on the Dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with
respect to Open-Market Purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan
Administrator is unable to invest the full Dividend amount in Open-Market
Purchases during the purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a
market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease
making Open-Market Purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the
Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares at net asset value per common
share at the close of business on the Last Purchase Date provided that, if the
net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the then current market price
per common share; the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by 95% of
the market price on the payment date.

The Plan Administrator maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including
information needed by shareholders for tax records. Common shares in the account
of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator on behalf of the
Plan participant, and each shareholder proxy will include those shares purchased
or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Administrator will forward all proxy
solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held under
the Plan in accordance with the instruction of the participants.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to common shares issued directly
by the Fund. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage
commission incurred in connection with Open-Market Purchases. The automatic
reinvestment of Dividends will not relieve participants of any Federal, state or
local income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such
Dividends.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants with regard to purchases in the Plan; however,
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants. All correspondence or questions concerning the Plan
should be directed to the Plan Administrator, BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, PO
Box 358015, Pittsburgh, PA 15252-8015, Phone Number: (866) 488-3559.

About the FUND MANAGER |

MADISON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC
Madison Asset Management, LLC, (MAM) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Madison
Investment Advisors, Inc., with its affiliates, manages more than $7 billion in
individual, corporate, pension, insurance, endowment and mutual fund assets.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
MAM believes in investing in high-quality growth companies, which deliver
potentially consistent and sustainable earnings growth, yet sell at attractive
valuations. Historically, shareholders of these types of companies have been
rewarded over the long term with above-average returns, and favorable risk
characteristics. Constructing portfolios with positive risk/reward profiles has
historically allowed clients to participate during strong market environments,
while mitigating potential declines.

INVESTMENT PROCESS
The managers employ a fundamental, bottom-up strategy in constructing equity
portfolios. The managers look for companies that they believe are consistently
growing at an above-average pace, yet sell at below-average multiple.

The managers follow a rigorous three-step process when evaluating companies and
then employ an actively-managed option strategy to help enhance income and
mitigate downside risk.

1.    BUSINESS MODEL. The managers look for a sustainable competitive advantage,
      cash flow that is both predictable and growing, as well as a rock-solid
      balance sheet.

2.    MANAGEMENT. When assessing management, the managers look to see how the
      company has allocated capital in the past, their track record for
      enhancing shareholder value and the nature of their accounting practices.

3.    PROPER VALUATION. The final step in the process is assessing the proper
      valuation for the company. The managers strive to purchase securities
      trading at a discount to their intrinsic value as determined by discounted
      cash flows. They corroborate this valuation work with additional valuation
      methodologies.

The covered call investment strategy focuses on stocks in which the managers
have high confidence in their continuing earnings growth rates, but sell at
reasonable Price-Earnings Ratios. By writing the majority of the Fund's calls
out-of-the-money, meaning the strike price is higher than the stock price, the
Fund can participate in some stock appreciation while still receiving income in
the form of option premiums. The covered call strategy also tends to reduce the
risk compared to just owning the stock.

ITEM 2.  CODE OF ETHICS.

     (a)  The registrant has adopted a code of ethics (the "Code of Ethics")
          that applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial
          officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons
          performing similar functions.

     (b)  No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.


     (c)  During the registrant's fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, the Code
          of Ethics was not amended.


     (d)  The registrant has not granted a waiver or an implicit waiver to its
          principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal
          accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
          functions from a provision of its Code of Ethics during the period
          covered by this report.

     (e)  Not applicable.

     (f)  (1) The registrant's Code of Ethics is attached hereto as an exhibit.

          (2)  Not applicable.

          (3)  Not applicable.

ITEM 3.  AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Trustees has determined that it has at least one audit
committee financial expert serving on its audit committee (the "Audit
Committee"), Ronald E. Toupin, Jr. Mr. Toupin is an "independent" Trustee for
purposes of this Item 3 of Form N-CSR. Mr. Toupin qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert by virtue of his experience obtained as a portfolio
manager and research analyst, which included review and analysis of offering
documents and audited and unaudited financial statements using GAAP to show
accounting estimates, accruals and reserves.

(Under applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit
committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose,
including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, as a result of being designated or identified as an
audit committee financial expert. The designation or identification of a person
as an audit committee financial expert does not impose on such person any
duties, obligations, or liabilities that are greater than the duties,
obligations, and liabilities imposed on such person as a member of the Audit
Committee and Board of Trustees in the absence of such designation or
identification. The designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert does not affect the duties, obligations or liability
of any other member of the Audit Committee or Board of Trustees.)

ITEM 9. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT

None.

ITEM 10.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

On January 20, 2009, the registrant's Board of Trustees (the "Board") approved a
revised written charter (the "Nominating and Governance Committee Charter") for
its nominating and governance committee (the "Nominating and Governance
Committee") that contains changes to the procedures by which shareholders may
recommend nominees to the Board.

Under the Nominating and Governance Charter, the previously existing procedures
by which shareholders may recommend nominees to the Board, as described in the
registrant's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on June 25, 2008, remain in effect. In addition to these previously existing
procedures, the Nominating and Governance Charter includes a new requirement
that following the submission by a shareholder of a Trustee candidate
recommendation, a Trustee candidate must (i) be prepared to submit written
answers to a questionnaire seeking professional and personal information that
will assist the Nominating and Governance Committee to evaluate the candidate
and to determine, among other matters, whether the candidate would qualify as a
Trustee who is not an "interested person" of the registrant as such term is
defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940; (ii) be prepared to submit
character references and agree to appropriate background checks; and (iii) be
prepared to meet with one or more members of the Nominating and Governance
Committee at a time and location convenient to those Nominating and Governance
Committee members in order to discuss the nominee's qualifications.

A copy of the Nominating and Governance Committee Charter will be filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as an appendix to the registrant's 2009 proxy
statement.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have evaluated the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) as of a date
within 90 days of this filing and have concluded based on such evaluation, that
the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of that
date, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the registrant in
this Form N-CSR was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the
time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and
forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940)
that occurred during the registrant's last fiscal quarter of the period covered
by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

                                 CODE OF ETHICS
                                       FOR
                  CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS


     Each of the registered investment companies listed in Appendix A hereto
(each a "Trust") is committed to conducting business in accordance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business
ethics, and to full and accurate financial disclosure in compliance with
applicable law. This Code of Ethics, applicable to the Trust's Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
functions) (together, "Senior Officers"), sets forth specific policies to guide
you in the performance of your duties.

     As a Senior Officer, you must comply with applicable law. You also have a
responsibility to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner; and you have
leadership responsibilities that include creating a culture of high ethical
standards and commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment that
encourages employees to raise concerns, and promptly addressing employee
compliance concerns.

     The Code of Ethics of the Trust pursuant to Rule 17j-1(c) under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") (the "1940 Act Code
of Ethics"), which this Code of Ethics is intended to supplement, sets forth the
fundamental principles and key policies and procedures that govern the conduct
of all of us in our business as registered investment companies. You are also
bound by the requirements and standards set forth in this Code of Ethics and
other applicable laws and regulations and other policies and procedures adopted
by the Trust from time to time.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

     You are required to comply with the laws, rules and regulations that govern
the conduct of our business and to report any suspected violations in accordance
with the section below entitled "Compliance with Code of Ethics."

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     Senior Officers are expected to dedicate their best efforts to advancing
the Trust's interests and to use objective and unbiased standards when making
decisions that affect the Trust, keeping in mind that you are subject to
inherent conflicts of interest because you are an officer of Claymore Advisors,
LLC (the "Adviser") as well as the Trust. Your obligation to conduct the Trust's
business in an honest and ethical manner includes the ethical handling of actual
or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and business relationships. A
conflict of interest for the purpose of this Code of Ethics occurs when your
private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere, with the
interests of the Trust. The 1940 Act Code of Ethics, the Advisers' and the
Trust's allocation procedures and the other policies of the Trust are designed
to ensure the ethical handling of such conflicts. As a result, it is incumbent
on you to be familiar with the 1940 Act Code of Ethics, the Adviser's and
Trust's allocations procedures and other rules and regulations under the 1940
Act as well as the policies of the Trust. When making any investment, accepting
any position or benefits, participating in any transaction or business
arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates or appears to create a
conflict of interest where you are

<PAGE>
receiving a personal benefit, you should act in accordance with the letter and
the spirit of the 1940 Act Code of Ethics and/or the Trust's or the Advisor's
other applicable policies and procedures. If you are in doubt as to the
application or interpretation of any of these, you should make full disclosure
of all facts and circumstances to, and obtain the prior written approval of the
Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust or, in his absence, any Independent
Trustee of the Trust.(1).

DISCLOSURES

     It is the policy of the Trust to make full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
in all reports and documents that the Trust files with, or submits to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and in all other public communications made
by the Trust. As a Senior Officer, you are required to promote compliance with
this policy by all employees and to abide by the Trust's standards, policies and
procedures designed to promote compliance with this policy.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

     If you know of or suspect a violation of this Code of Ethics or other laws,
regulations, policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you must
immediately report that information to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of
the Trust or, in his absence, any Independent Trustee of the Trust. No one will
be subject to retaliation because of a good faith report of a suspected
violation.

     The Trust will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

          o    the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust will take all
               appropriate action to investigate any actual or potential
               violations reported to him;

          o    violations and potential violations will be reported to the
               Independent Trustees after such investigation;

          o    if the Independent Trustees determine that a violation has
               occurred, they will take, or shall designate appropriate persons
               to determine, appropriate action in response to violations of
               this Code of Ethics; and

          o    appropriate action may include a letter of censure, suspension,
               dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious
               violations of law, notification of the Securities and Exchange
               Commission or other appropriate law enforcement authorities.

     Senior Officers must make this Code of Ethics known to persons who might
know of potential conflicts of interest, including any "whistle blower" policies
that the Trust may adopt from time to time.

WAIVERS OF CODE OF ETHICS

     Except as otherwise provided in this Code of Ethics, the Chairman of the
Audit Committee of the Trust is responsible for applying this Code of Ethics to
specific situations in which questions are presented to the Chairman of the
Audit Committee of the Trust and has the authority to

(1)  An "Independent Trustee" is any Trustee who is not an "interested person"
     of the Trust within the meaning of the 1940 Act.

<PAGE>
interpret this Code of Ethics in any particular situation. The Chairman of the
Audit Committee of the Trust shall take action he or she considers appropriate
to investigate any actual or potential violations reported under this Code of
Ethics.

     The Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust is authorized to consult,
as appropriate, with the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Trust, the
Independent Trustees or the Board of Trustees and with counsel to the Trust,
Claymore or the Independent Trustees, and is encouraged to do so.

     The Independent Trustees are responsible for granting waivers of this Code
of Ethics, as appropriate. Any changes to or waivers of this Code of Ethics
will, to the extent required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR as provided by
Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

NO RIGHTS CREATED

     This Code of Ethics is a statement of certain fundamental principles,
policies and procedures that govern the Trust's Senior Officers in the conduct
of the Trust's business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights in
any employee, investor, supplier, competitor, shareholder or any other person or
entity.

<DESCRIPTION>PROXY VOTING POLICIES
<TEXT>
                                                                     EXHIBIT (c)


                              PROXY VOTING POLICIES

Our policies regarding voting the proxies of securities held in client accounts
depend on the nature of our relationship to the client. When we are an ERISA
fiduciary of an account, there are additional considerations and procedures than
for all other (regular) accounts. In all cases, when we vote client proxies, we
must do so in the client's best interests as described below by these policies.

REGULAR ACCOUNTS
We do not assume the role of an active shareholder when managing client
accounts. If we are dissatisfied with the performance of a particular company,
we will generally reduce or terminate our position in the company rather than
attempt to force management changes through shareholder activism.

MAKING THE INITIAL DECISION ON HOW TO VOTE THE PROXY
As stated above, our goal and intent is to vote all proxies in the client's best
interests. For practical purposes, unless we make an affirmative decision to the
contrary, when we vote a proxy as the Board of Directors of a company
recommends, it means we agree with the Board that voting in such manner is in
the interests of our clients as shareholders of the company for the reasons
stated by the Board. However, if we believe that voting as the Board of
Directors recommends would not be in a client's best interests, then we must
vote against the Board's recommendation.

As a matter of standard operating procedure, all proxies received shall be voted
(by telephone or Internet or through a proxy voting service), unless we are not
authorized to vote proxies. When the client has reserved the right to vote
proxies in his/her/its account, we must make arrangements for proxies to be
delivered directly to such client from its custodian and, to the extent any such
proxies are received by us inadvertently, promptly forward them to the client.

DOCUMENTING OUR DECISIONS
In cases where a proxy will NOT be voted or, as described below, voted against
the Board of Directors recommendation, our policy is to make a notation to the
file containing the records for such security (e.g., Corporation X research
file, since we may receive numerous proxies for the same company and it is
impractical to keep such records in the file of each individual client)
explaining our action or inaction, as the case may be. Alternatively, or in
addition to such notation, we may include a copy of the rationale for such
decision in the appropriate equity correspondence file.

WHY WOULD VOTING AS THE BOARD RECOMMENDS NOT BE IN THE CLIENT'S BEST INTERESTS?
Portfolio management must, at a minimum, consider the following questions before
voting any proxy:

1. Is the Board of Directors recommending an action that could dilute or
otherwise diminish the value of our position? (This question is more complex
than it looks: We must consider the time frames involved for both the client and
the issuer. For example, if the Board of Directors is recommending an action
that might initially cause the position to lose value but will increase the
value of the position in the long-term, we would vote as the Board recommended
for if we are holding the security for clients as a long-term investment.
However, if the investment is close to our valuation limits and we are
anticipating eliminating the position in the short-term, then it would be in our
clients' best interests to vote against management's recommendation.)

<PAGE>
2. If so, would we be unable to liquidate the affected securities without
incurring a loss that would not otherwise have been recognized absent
management's proposal?

3. Is the Board of Directors recommending an action that could cause the
securities held to lose value, rights or privileges and there are no comparable
replacement investments readily available on the market? (For example, a company
can be uniquely positioned in the market because of its valuation compared with
otherwise comparable securities such that it would not be readily replaceable if
we were to liquidate the position. In such a situation, we might vote against
management's recommendation if we believe a "No" vote could help prevent future
share price depreciation resulting from management's proposal or if we believe
the value of the investment will appreciate if management's proposal fails. A
typical recent example of this type of decision is the case of a Board
recommendation not to expense stock options, where we would vote against
management's recommendation because we believe expensing such options will do
more to enhance shareholder value going forward.)

4. Would accepting the Board of Directors recommendation cause us to violate our
client's investment guidelines? (For example, a Board may recommend merging the
company into one that is not permitted by client investment guidelines, e.g. a
tobacco product company, a foreign security that is not traded on any US
exchange or in US dollars, etc., restrictions often found in client investment
guidelines. This would be an unusual situation and it is possible we would,
nevertheless, vote in favor of a Board's recommendation in anticipation of
selling the investment prior to the date any vote would effectively change the
nature of the investment as described. Moreover, this does not mean we will
consider any client-provided proxy voting guidelines. Our policy is that client
investment guidelines may not include proxy voting guidelines if our firm will
vote account proxies. Rather, we will only vote client proxies in accordance
with these guidelines. Clients who wish their account proxies to be voted in
accordance with their own proxy voting guidelines must retain proxy voting
authority for themselves.)

Essentially, we must "second guess" the Board of Directors to determine if their
recommendation is in the best interests of our clients, regardless of whether
the Board thinks their recommendation is in the best interests of shareholders
in general. The above questions should apply no matter the type of action
subject to the proxy. For example, changes in corporate governance structures,
adoption or amendments to compensation plans (including stock options) and
matters involving social issues or corporate responsibility should all be
reviewed in the context of how it will affect our clients' investment.

In making our decisions, to the extent we rely on any analysis outside of the
information contained in the proxy statements, we must retain a record of such
information in the same manner as other books and records (2 years in the
office, 5 years in an easily accessible place). Also, if a proxy statement is
NOT available on the SEC's EDGAR database, we must keep a copy of the proxy
statement.

ADDRESSING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Although it is not likely, in the event there is a conflict of interest between
us and our client in connection with a material proxy vote (for example, (1) the
issuer or an affiliate of the issuer is also a client or is actively being
sought as a client or (2) we have a significant business relationship with the
issuer such that voting in a particular manner could jeopardize this client
and/or business relationship), our policy is to alert affected client(s) of the
conflict before voting and indicate the manner in which we will vote. In such
circumstances, our client(s) may instruct us to vote in a different manner. In
any case, we must obtain client consent to vote the proxy when faced with a
conflict of interest. If the conflict involves a security held by a mutual fund
we manage, then we must present the material conflict to the Board of the
applicable fund for consent or direction to

<PAGE>
vote the proxies. If the conflict involves a security held by wrap accounts,
then we may present the conflict to the wrap sponsor, as our agent, to obtain
wrap client consent or direction to vote the proxies. Note that no conflict
generally exists for routine proxy matters such as approval of the independent
auditor (unless, of course, the auditor in question is a client, we are seeking
the auditor as a client or we have a significant business relationship with the
auditor), electing an uncontested Board of Directors, etc.

In the event it is impractical to obtain client consent to vote a proxy when
faced with a conflict of interest, or at the request of the applicable fund
Board, the firm will employ the services of an independent third party "proxy
services firm" to make the proxy voting decision in accordance with Rule
206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended. The firm has
retained the firm of Glass Lewis & Co. to serve in this capacity. All investment
company Boards for which we provide investment management services have
requested we utilize the recommendations of Glass Lewis & Co. in cases of
conflicts of interest.

Once any member of the relevant portfolio management team determines that it
would be in our clients' best interests to vote AGAINST management
recommendations (or, for Madison Scottsdale and Concord Asset Management, any
particular portfolio manager makes such determination), then the decision should
be brought to the attention of the Investment Committee, or any subcommittee
appointed by the Investment Committee from among its members (such subcommittee
may be a single person), to ratify the decision to stray from our general policy
of voting with management. Such ratification need not be in writing.

The Investment Committee or any subcommittee appointed by the Investment
Committee from among its members (such subcommittee may be a single person)
shall monitor potential conflicts of interest between our firm and clients that
would affect the manner by which we vote a proxy. We maintain a "conflicted
list" for proxy voting purposes.

As of January 1, 2004, Jay Sekelsky represents the Investment Committee
subcommittee described above.

ERISA FIDUCIARY ACCOUNTS
As a general rule, an ERISA plan Trustee is required to vote proxies. However,
the fiduciary act of managing plan assets includes the responsibility to vote
proxies on plan-owned stock when the named fiduciary has delegated management
responsibility to an investment manager. Therefore, unless another named
fiduciary (Trustee, another investment manager, consultant, plan administrator,
employer, etc.) for any ERISA client expressly reserves the right to vote
proxies, we are required to do so. In most cases, the plan document will specify
who is required to vote proxies.

It is important that our investment management agreement (or the ERISA client's
plan document) (collectively, the "Contracts") address the issue of who is
responsible for voting proxies.

1. If the Contracts expressly preclude us from voting proxies, then the Trustee
must vote proxies attributable to our ERISA client's accounts.

2. On the other hand, if the Contracts are silent or simply state that we "may"
vote proxies, then it is our fiduciary duty to affirmatively vote under ERISA.

ERISA requires us, when we are responsible for voting proxies:

1. To maintain voting records for review by the named fiduciary of the plan; and

2. Ensure that the custodian (or plan Trustee, as the case may be) forward to us
all proxies received so that we may vote them in a timely manner.

<PAGE>
Our general policy is to vote all ERISA plan proxies received in the same manner
as we vote non-ERISA plan proxies described above. Again, as a matter of
standard operating procedure, all proxies received shall be voted (by telephone
or Internet).

ADDITIONAL RECORDKEEPING RULES RELATED TO PROXY VOTING
We must keep any written documents (including email) we prepared that were
material to making a decision on how to vote a proxy (or that memorialized the
basis for our decision). As noted above, we need not keep a copy of the actual
proxy statements we received if they are available on the SEC's EDGAR database.

We must keep in the applicable client file records of written client requests
for proxy voting information. We must, of course, also keep a copy in the client
file of any of our written responses to clients who asked for such information
either in writing or orally.

We retained the services of ProxyEdge to maintain the records of the proxy votes
we cast on behalf of clients. To the extent we vote any proxies outside of this
service (for example, for logistical purposes, certain Madison Scottsdale
proxies may not be maintained by this service), then copies of the voted proxy
must be maintained in the applicable client or research file, as the case may
be. Unless an investment company invests exclusively in non-voting securities,
it shall file Form N-PX annually with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission no later than August 31 for the period covering the previous July 1
through June 30.
