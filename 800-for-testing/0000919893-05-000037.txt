Franklin Templeton Investments

GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)


Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the specialized
expertise of three world-class investment management groups--Franklin, Templeton
and Mutual Series.

Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying on its
own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines that underlie
its success.

FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized leader in fixed income
investing and also brings expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
investing.

TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing and, in
1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today, with
offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers investors a truly global
perspective.

MUTUAL Series. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style of
value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among what it believes
are undervalued stocks, as well as arbitrage situations and distressed
securities.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE

Because our management groups work independently and adhere to different
investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically
have distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be used to build truly
diversified allocation plans covering every major asset class.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION

At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the
reliable, accurate and personal service that has helped us become one of the
most trusted names in financial services.

Important Notice to Shareholders


REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program, which was
originally implemented in October 1997. The Fund's Board of Directors had
discontinued the open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection
with the Fund's previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund
may purchase, from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in
open-market transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's Investment Manager.

Dear Shareholder:

This semiannual report for Templeton Dragon Fund covers the period ended June

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Templeton Dragon Fund posted cumulative total returns of +4.42% in market price

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

In general, China continued to record strong growth, with 9.4% first quarter
2005 gross domestic product (GDP) growth compared with a year earlier.1 Strong
consumer consumption, trade and investment contributed to GDP growth. However,
inflationary pressures eased, and there was slower growth in some areas of the
economy. The consumer price index (CPI) increased 1.8% in May compared with a
year earlier, unchanged from April and down from March's 2.7%.1 Fixed asset
investment grew 26% in May compared with a year earlier. Although marginally
higher than April's 25% increase, it was well below the 50% level seen in early
2004.1

High oil prices and lower exports hurt Taiwan's economic recovery, as GDP growth
in first quarter 2005 slowed to 2.5% year-over-year, down from 3.3% in fourth
quarter 2004.2 The government lowered its full-year growth forecast, as external
trade, a significant contributor to the island's GDP, weakened. In an effort to
widen the tax base and improve economic competitiveness, Taiwan plans to submit
new tax legislation for parliamentary approval in July.

Hong Kong recorded solid economic growth, with first quarter GDP expanding 6.0%
compared with a year earlier, mainly supported by strong exports and domestic
consumption.3 The government forecast GDP growth of between 4.5% and 5.5% in
2005.4 Exports rose 8.9% in the first quarter year-over-year, while private
consumption increased 4.6%.4 Unemployment declined, with the jobless rate
registering 5.7% for the three-month period ended May 2005, a 43-month low. 3 In
politics, Donald Tsang became Hong Kong's new chief executive after the early
resignation of Tung Chee-Hwa.

Equity markets in the greater China region declined in first quarter 2005 as
investor sentiment was adversely affected by China's passage of an
anti-secession law, which allows China to use force against Taiwan if the latter
demands independence. Rising U.S. interest rates and high oil prices also
impacted investor confidence. Hong Kong stocks, particularly those in the
property sector, suffered from rising short-term interest rates. Market
sentiment turned positive in the second quarter as government efforts to curb
growth in heated sectors showed some progress, and the Morgan Stanley Capital
International (MSCI) China Index returned 5.25% in U.S. dollar

terms for the six months ended June 30, 2005.5 Taiwan's market benefited from
MSCI index rebalancing, which raised the country's weighting in MSCI's indexes.
Speculation over the revaluation of the Chinese yuan led to greater fund inflows
into Hong Kong.


INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources, profit
margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government regulation,
management and other factors in comparison to other companies around the world
that we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the MSCI China Index posted a 5.25%
total return. 5

Relative to the MSCI China Index, the Fund's largest contribution to performance
came from our position in Dairy Farm International Holdings, a group with core
interests in supermarkets, drugstores, convenience stores and restaurant
businesses in Asia. In addition to the food and staples retailing sector, the
Fund's absence of insurance holdings, as well as an underweighted position in
the transportation industry, positively affected performance.6 The fact that the
Fund did not hold China Shipping, Ping An Insurance, and PICC Property and
Casualty Company helped relative performance, as those stocks significantly
underperformed the index during the period.

market performance in China. The index is unmanaged and includes reinvested
dividends. One cannot invest directly in an index, nor is an index

6. The transportation sector comprises air freight and logistics, airlines, and
transportation infrastructure in the SOI.

<PAGE>

Conversely, the Fund's underweighted exposure to the energy and
telecommunication services sectors, as well as an overweighted position in
commercial banks, detracted from performance.7 Underweighted positions relative
to the MSCI China Index in PetroChina and China Mobile (Hong Kong) also hurt
relative performance as both stocks significantly outperformed the index. The
Fund's positions in HSBC Holdings and Mega Financial Holdings hindered
performance as these stocks declined in value during the period. HSBC is one of
the largest banking and financial services organizations in the world, while
Mega is one of the largest financial holding companies in Taiwan. Therefore, we
believe both companies are well positioned to benefit from increasing demand for
banking services globally over the longer term, which is in line with our
investment strategy.

During the reporting period, the Fund increased its holdings in China H and Red
Chip shares as selective stocks reached our buy limits. Key stock purchases
included China's national carrier and the country's largest commercial airline,
Air China; China Mobile (Hong Kong), a dominant wireless telecommunications
operator with 220 million subscribers in China; and PetroChina, which has a
dominant market share in upstream oil and gas businesses with huge proven
reserves in China. The Fund also made an investment in South Korea's LG Corp.,
which increased exposure to the multi-holdings sector.

The Fund reduced its exposure to Taiwan and the China Shenzhen "B" market during
the period. Significant sales included shares of Sinopac Holdings and China
International Marine Containers. The Fund repositioned its Hong Kong holdings by
adding Hopewell Holdings and reducing exposure to Hang Lung Group. Hopewell
Holdings is involved in infrastructure projects, property development and
investments, hotel operations and management, restaurant operations and
catering, and construction and project management.




7. The energy sector comprises oil, gas and consumable fuels in the SOI.
Telecommunication services comprises diversified telecommunication services and
wireless telecommunication services in the SOI.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund), is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company.

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market.

Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset value.
Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Some methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Directors.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income.
Fund distributions to shareholders are determined on an income tax basis and may
differ from net investment income and realized gains for financial reporting
purposes.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.


2. CAPITAL STOCK

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program. Originally
implemented in October 1997, the Fund's Board of Directors had discontinued the
open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection with the Fund's
previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund may purchase,
from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in open-market
transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.

At June 30, 2005, there were 100 million shares authorized ($0.01 par value).
During the period ended June 30, 2005, there were no share transactions; all
reinvested distributions were satisfied with previously issued shares purchased
in the open market. During the year ended December 31, 2004, 50,373 shares were
issued for $857,852 from reinvested distributions.

B. ADMINISTRATIVE FEES

The Fund pays an administrative fee to FT Services of 0.15% per year of the
Fund's average weekly net assets, of which 0.10% is paid to Nomura Asset
Management U.S.A. Inc., for sub-administrative services.


4. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the period ended June 30, 2005, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.


5. INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2004, the Fund had deferred capital losses occurring subsequent

reflected in the year ending December 31, 2005.

Net investment income (loss) differs for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions.

7. CREDIT RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values, changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.


8. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market

9. RECENT LITIGATION

Pursuant to a settlement agreement which was announced on March 20, 2003,
between the Fund and Harvard College, a former shareholder of the Fund, Harvard
Management Company, Inc. ("Harvard Management"), which is an investment advisor
to Harvard College, and Steven Alperin, an officer of Harvard Management at the
time (referred to collectively as "Harvard"), the Fund agreed to take, and the
Board approved, the following actions, among other actions, which have already
been carried out.

 o IN-KIND TENDER OFFERs--The Fund has applied to the SEC for an exemptive
   order allowing the Fund to make occasional, non-periodic tender offers, each
   for up to 20% of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price equal to 95% of net
   asset value per share as of the date the offer expires, to be paid entirely
   in kind through a pro rata distribution of marketable portfolio securities
   and available cash. Subject to certain conditions, the settlement required
   the Fund to commence such an in-kind tender offer for 20% of the Fund's
   shares within three months after obtaining the SEC exemption. The Fund has
   also been required under the settlement to conduct, on substantially
   identical terms, up to two additional in-kind tender offers under certain
   circumstances. There is no assurance that the SEC will issue the exemptive
   order, nor is it possible to predict the date when an exemptive order might
   be granted.

 o ADDITIONAL CASH TENDER OFFERS--If the SEC did not issue the exemptive order
   for in-kind tender offers by March 26, 2004, the settlement provided that the
   Fund could, but was not obligated to, conduct an additional cash tender
   offer, and possibly later follow-on cash tender offers, each for 15% of the
   Fund's outstanding shares at a price of 92.5% of net asset value per share as
   of the date the offer expires. Under certain circumstances, if the Fund did
   not conduct these tender offers, Harvard would be relieved of its obligation
   to refrain from making shareholder proposals and taking other actions with
   respect to the Fund. The exemptive application was not received by March 26,
   2004 and the Fund did not conduct any tender offers for the period ended June
   30, 2005.

The settlement agreement provides that the Fund will not be obligated to
commence in-kind tender offers or additional cash tender offers under certain
circumstances or conditions. These relate to, among other things, the number of
shares tendered by shareholders into preceding tender offers as well as the
beneficial ownership percentages of the Fund's shareholders.

9. RECENT LITIGATION (CONTINUED)

STANDSTILL. As part of the settlement, Harvard agreed not to submit any
proposals for consideration by shareholders of the Fund, or any other closed-end
fund or similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates, or for
consideration by shareholders of Franklin Resources, Inc., nor to encourage
others to do so, for a period of four years. Harvard also has agreed not at any
time to acquire additional shares of the Fund or any other closed-end fund or
similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS
As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO"), and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), relating to certain
practices in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and
marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (as used in this section,
together, the "Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and
employees of the Company, provided documents and information in response to
subpoenas and/or requests for documents, information and/or testimony. Beginning
in August 2004, the Company entered into settlements with certain of the
regulators and a governmental entity investigating the mutual fund industry
practices noted above. The Company believes that settlement of each of the
matters is in the best interest of the Company and shareholders of the Franklin,
Templeton, and Mutual Series mutual funds (the "funds").

Two of the settlement agreements, those with the SEC and the CAGO concerning
marketing support payments, provide that the distribution of settlement monies
are to be made to the relevant funds, not to individual shareholders. The CAGO
has approved the distribution plan pertaining to the distribution of the monies
owed under the CAGO settlement agreement and, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of that settlement, the monies were disbursed to the participating
funds. The Fund did not participate in the CAGO settlement. The SEC has not yet
approved the distribution plan pertaining to the SEC settlement. When approved,
disbursements of settlement monies under the SEC's settlement will be made
promptly in accordance with the terms and conditions of that order.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
On April 12, 2005, the Attorney General of West Virginia filed a complaint in
the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia against a number of
companies engaged in the mutual fund industry, including Franklin Resources,
Inc. and its subsidiary, Franklin Advisers, Inc., and certain other parties
alleging violations of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act and
seeking, among other things, civil penalties and attorneys' fees and costs.
Defendants have since removed the matter to the United States District Court for
the Northern District of West Virginia. To the extent applicable to the Company,
the complaint arises from activity that occurred in 2001 and duplicates, in
whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the February 4, 2004 Massachusetts
Administrative Complaint concerning one instance of market timing (the
"Administrative Complaint") and the SEC's findings regarding market timing in
its August 2, 2004 Order (the "SEC Order"), both of which matters were
previously reported.

The Company, in addition to certain Franklin, Templeton, and Mutual Series
mutual funds, current and former officers, employees, and directors have been
named in multiple lawsuits in different courts alleging violations of various
federal securities laws and seeking, among other relief, monetary damages,
restitution, removal of fund trustees, directors, advisers, administrators, and
distributors, rescission of management contracts and 12b-1 plans, and/or
attorneys' fees and costs. Specifically, the lawsuits claim breach of duty with
respect to alleged arrangements to permit market timing and/or late trading
activity, or breach of duty with respect to the valuation of the portfolio
securities of certain Templeton funds managed by Franklin Resources, Inc.
subsidiaries, resulting in alleged market timing activity. The majority of these
lawsuits duplicate, in whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the
Administrative Complaint and the SEC's findings regarding market timing in the
SEC Order. The lawsuits are styled as class actions, or derivative actions on
behalf of either the named funds or Franklin Resources, Inc.

The Company, in addition to certain Franklin, Templeton, and Mutual Series
mutual funds, current and former officers, employees, and directors have been
named in multiple lawsuits alleging violations of various securities laws and
pendent state law claims relating to the disclosure of marketing support
payments and/or payment of allegedly excessive commissions and/or advisory or
distribution fees, and seeking, among other relief, monetary damages,
restitution, rescission of advisory contracts, including recovery of all fees
paid pursuant to those contracts, an accounting of all monies paid to the named
advisers, declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and/or attorneys' fees and
costs. These lawsuits are styled as class actions or derivative actions brought
on behalf of the named funds.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)
The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the lawsuits described above are without merit and intends to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. Public trust and confidence are critical to the Company's business and
any material loss of investor and/or client confidence could result in a
significant decline in assets under management by the Company, which would have
an adverse effect on future financial results. If it is determined that the
Company bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that
caused losses to the Fund, it is committed to making the Fund or its
shareholders whole, as appropriate. The Company is committed to taking all
appropriate actions to protect the interests of its funds' shareholders.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN


The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan (other than shareholders holding
their shares through Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, who will not be
enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and they elect to
participate), unless he elects to withdraw. If the shares are registered in the
name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the
broker-dealer or nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the
shareholder's behalf unless the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless
the reinvestment service is not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Administrator must
receive written notice within 10 business days before the record date for the
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attn:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator shall apply such payments
(less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to
purchases of the Fund's shares in the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN (CONTINUED)


The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services LLC,
P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant
will receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in the participant's
name for all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant
wishes, the Plan Administrator will sell the participant's shares and send the
proceeds, less a service charge and less trading fees. The fees for the sale of
shares through the Plan are $15.00 per transaction plus a $0.12 per share
trading fee.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT

At a meeting held March 1, 2005, the Board of Directors ("Board"), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Directors, approved renewal of the
investment advisory contract for Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"). In
reaching this decision, the Board took into account information furnished
throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as information prepared
specifically in connection with the annual renewal review process. Information
furnished and discussed throughout the year included reports on the Fund, the
share price premium or discount to net asset value, the results of investment
performance and related financial information for the Fund, as well as periodic
reports on legal compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and
other services provided by the Investment Manager ("Manager") and its
affiliates. Information furnished specifically in connection with the renewal
process included a report prepared by Lipper Financial Services ("Lipper"), an
independent organization, as well as a Fund profitability analysis report
prepared by management. The Lipper report compared the Fund's investment
performance and expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable to the Fund
as selected by Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report discussed the
profitability to Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall U.S. fund
operations, as well as on an individual fund-by-fund basis. Included with such
profitability analysis report was information on a fund-by-fund basis listing
portfolio managers and other accounts they manage, as well as information on
management fees charged by the Manager including management's explanation of
differences where relevant, and a three-year expense analysis with an
explanation for any increase in expense ratios. Additional information
accompanying such report was a memorandum prepared by management describing
enhancements to the services provided to the funds by the Franklin Templeton
Investments organization, as well as a memorandum relating to economies of
scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Directors received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment advisory contract for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Directors, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment advisory contract was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses the primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed below, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished them showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. Favorable consideration was given to management's efforts and

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT (CONTINUED)

expenditures in establishing back-up systems and recovery procedures to function
in the event of a natural disaster, it being noted by the Board that such
systems and procedures had functioned smoothly during the hurricanes and
blackout experienced last year in Florida. Other factors taken into account by
the Board were the Manager's best execution trading policies, including a
favorable third-party report on portfolio execution, as well as the compliance
procedures and qualifications of the Chief Compliance Officer established in
accordance with recently adopted SEC requirements. Consideration was also given
to the experience of the Fund's portfolio management team, the number of
accounts managed and general method of compensation. In this latter respect, the
Board noted that a primary factor in management's determination of the level of
a portfolio manager's bonus compensation was the relative investment performance
of the funds he or she managed so as to be aligned with the interests of Fund
shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the contract renewals.
The Lipper report prepared for the Fund showed its investment performance in
comparison with a performance group consisting of the Fund and five other
closed-end Pacific region funds as selected by Lipper during 2004, as well as
during the previous ten-year period. Such report considers total return on a net
asset value basis without regard to market discounts or premiums in order to
accurately reflect investment performance. The Lipper report showed that while
the Fund's total return for 2004 was the fourth lowest of such group, its total
return on an annualized basis was the highest in such group during each of the
previous three-, five- and ten-year periods. In discussing this performance,
management pointed out that the Fund's total return in net asset value terms
during 2004 exceeded that of the MSCI China Index, which it believed was an
appropriate basis of comparison in view of the Fund's focus on China related
stocks. The Board was satisfied with the Fund's performance, noting that the
Fund's 2004 total return exceeded 15% as shown in such Lipper report.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a Lipper report analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with an expense
group consisting of the Fund, five other non-leveraged closed-end Pacific region
funds, and four non-leveraged closed-end Pacific ex-Japan funds, as selected by
Lipper. Prior to making such comparison, the Board relied upon a survey showing
that the scope of management advisory services covered under the Fund's
investment advisory contract was similar to those provided by fund managers to
other mutual fund groups that would be used as a basis of comparison in the
Lipper report. In reviewing comparative costs, emphasis was given to the Fund's
management fee in comparison with the effective management fee that would have
been charged by other funds within its Lipper expense group assuming they were
the same size as the Fund, as well as the actual total expenses of the Fund in
comparison with those of such expense group. The Lipper effective management fee
analysis considers administrative fees to be part of management fees and the
results of such expense

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT (CONTINUED)

comparisons showed the Fund's effective management fee rate to be the highest in
its expense group, but the Fund's actual total expenses to be the fourth lowest
in such Lipper expense group. The Board found such expenses to be acceptable.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
each of the individual funds. The Board also considered the extent to which the
Manager and its affiliates might derive ancillary benefits from fund operations,
as well as potential benefits resulting from allocation of fund brokerage and
the use of "soft" commission dollars to pay for research. Specific attention was
given to the methodology followed in allocating costs to each fund, it being
recognized that allocation methodologies are inherently subjective and various
allocation methodologies may each be reasonable while producing different
results. In this respect, the Board noted that the cost allocation methodology
was consistent with that followed in profitability report presentations made in
prior years and that it had engaged on a biennial basis the Fund's independent
accountants to perform certain procedures specified by the Board solely for its
purpose and use. It was also noted that legal costs and payments incurred by
Franklin Templeton in resolving various legal proceedings arising from its U.S.
fund operations had not been allocated to the Fund for purposes of determining
profitability. Included in the analysis were the revenue and related costs
involved in managing the Fund, as well as its relative contribution to the
profitability of the Manager's parent. In reviewing and discussing such
analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief that costs incurred in
establishing the infrastructure necessary to the type of fund operations
conducted by the Manager and its corporate affiliates may not be fully reflected
in the expenses allocated to each fund in determining its profitability, as well
as the fact that the level of profits, to a certain extent, reflected
operational cost savings and efficiencies initiated by management. In addition,
the Board considered a third-party study comparing the profitability of the
Manager's parent on an overall basis as compared to other publicly held managers
broken down to show profitability from management operations exclusive of
distribution expenses, as well as profitability including distribution expenses.
Based upon their consideration of all these factors, the Board determined that
the level of profits realized by the Manager under its investment advisory
contract with the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature, quality and
extent of services provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
Manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of scale
to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board believes
at

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT (CONTINUED)

some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale which should be

of the Fund accordingly. The Board noted that in the previous year it had added
a breakpoint to the Fund's investment advisory fee at the $1 billion level.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has  delegated  the authority to vote proxies
related  to the  portfolio  securities  held by the Fund to the  Fund's  manager
Templeton Asset  Management Ltd in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in  analyzing  proxies,  the manager  subscribes  to  Institutional
Shareholder  Services (ISS), an  unaffiliated  third party corporate  governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote  recommendations,  recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third  party   analytical   research   firm,   to  receive   analyses  and  vote
recommendations  on the  shareholder  meetings of publicly held U.S.  companies.
Although  ISS'  and/or  Glass  Lewis'  analyses  are  thoroughly   reviewed  and
considered  in making a final  voting  decision,  the manager  does not consider
recommendations   from  ISS,  Glass  Lewis  or  any  other  third  party  to  be
determinative  of the  manager's  ultimate  decision.  The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers,  directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose  interests  conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders.  All conflicts are resolved
in the  interests of the  manager's  clients.  In  situations  where the manager
perceives  a material  conflict  of  interest,  the manager  may:  disclose  the
conflict to the Fund's board of directors; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of directors,  ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services;  or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION  OF  AUDITORS  OF  PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES.  In light of several  high
profile  accounting  scandals,  the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance  of  auditors.  On a  case-by-case  basis,  the manager will examine
proposals  relating to non-audit  relationships  and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis,  proposals to rotate auditors,  and
will  vote  against  the  ratification  of  auditors  when  there is  clear  and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders'  long-term interests.  The manager
evaluates  plans on a  case-by-case  basis by  considering  several  factors  to
determine   whether  the  plan  is  fair  and  reasonable,   including  the  ISS
quantitative  model  utilized  to assess  such  plans  and/or  the  Glass  Lewis
evaluation of the plans.  The manager will generally  oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively  dilutive,  and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater  options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support  employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

July 1, 2003, and ending June 30, 2004.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes
in the Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation in connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES              Dated July 2004

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

         This code of ethics (the "Code") applies to the Principal Executive
Officers, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (the
"Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin Resources subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange Commission ("SEC") (collectively, "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer will be expected to adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      Other Policies and Procedures

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

         Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

         Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

         Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

         These reports will be reviewed by the Legal Department for compliance
with the Code.

         There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

         Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will
provide a report to the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the
next regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

         Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any
particular situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any approvals or waivers/4 sought by any Chief Executive
Officers of the Funds.

         The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has
       occurred, it will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the
       appropriate FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action,
       which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
       applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate
       personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation
       to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent  Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their
counsel.

IX. Internal Use

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the FT Funds and
does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any
fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

         Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment
company to disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the
report, it has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's
principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting
officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of
whether these officers are employed by the registrant or a third party. If the
registrant has not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not
done so.

         The registrant must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as
an exhibit to its annual report; (2) post the text of the code on its Internet
website and disclose, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake in its most recent report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such request may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or
waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a provision of the code in the
registrant's annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such information on its website, it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

         The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the foregoing disclosure is omitted or is determined
to be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with
the SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

         In such an event, the Fund Chief Compliance Officer shall review the
Code and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or appropriate to
prevent reoccurrences.
