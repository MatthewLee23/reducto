A Letter to Shareholders


Dear Shareholder

The November reporting period was fairly tumultuous for financial markets,
culminating in mixed results for some of the major benchmark indexes:

Subprime mortgage woes dominated headlines for much of 2007, but intensified
in the summer and fall, spawning a widespread liquidity and credit crisis with
ramifications across global markets. The Federal Reserve Board (the "Fed")
stepped in to inject liquidity into the markets and bolster investor
confidence, cutting the federal funds rate by 0.50% in September, 0.25% in
October and 0.25% in December, which brought the target short-term interest
rate to 4.25%. In taking action, the central bankers, who had long deemed
themselves inflation fighters, were seeking to stem the fallout from the
credit crunch and forestall a wider economic unraveling.

Amid the volatility throughout 2007, equity markets displayed surprising
resilience. To some extent, the credit turmoil dampened corporate merger-and-
acquisition (M&A) activity, a key source of strength for equity markets.
Still, market fundamentals generally held firm, dividend payouts and share
buybacks continued, and valuations remained attractive. As the returns
indicate, the most recent six months were more trying, reflecting the slowing
U.S. economy, a troubled housing market and a more difficult corporate
earnings backdrop. Overall, large cap stocks outperformed small caps as
investors grew increasingly risk averse. International markets fared better
than their U.S. counterparts, benefiting from generally stronger economies.

In fixed income markets, mixed economic signals and the credit woes resulted
in a flight to quality. Investors shunned bonds associated with the housing
and credit markets in favor of higher-quality Treasury issues. The yield on
10-year Treasury issues, which touched 5.30% in June (its highest level in
five years), fell to 3.97% by period-end, while prices correspondingly rose.
Meanwhile, the tax-exempt bond market has been challenged by a combination of
record-setting supply, economic uncertainty and concerns around the credit
worthiness of bond insurers. This brought municipal bond prices to relatively
attractive levels and, as such, demand generally held firm.

As you navigate market volatility, we encourage you to review your investment
goals with your financial professional and to make portfolio changes, as
needed. For more market insight and commentary from BlackRock investment
professionals, we invite you to visit www.blackrock.com/funds. As always, we
thank you for entrusting BlackRock with your investment assets, and we look
forward to continuing to serve you in the months and years ahead.


Sincerely,

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)


1. Significant Accounting Policies:

BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and BlackRock Muni New York
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. (the "Funds" or individually as the "Fund"),
are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as
non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies. The Funds'
financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, which may require the use of management accruals and
estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. These unaudited
financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are, in the opinion of
management, necessary to present a fair statement of the results for the
interim period. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The
Funds determine and make available for publication the net asset values of
their Common Stock on a daily basis. Each Fund's Common Stock shares are
listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MUI for BlackRock Muni
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and MNE for BlackRock Muni New York
Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.

(a) Valuation of investments--Municipal bonds are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid
price in the OTC market or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing
service. Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-
supplied valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing
service and its valuations are reviewed by the officers of each of the Funds
under the general direction of the respective Board of Directors. Such
valuations and procedures are reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors
of the Funds. Financial futures contracts and options thereon, which are
traded on exchanges, are valued at their closing prices as of the close of
such exchanges. Effective September 4, 2007, exchange-traded options are
valued at the mean between the last bid and ask prices at the close of the
options market in which the options trade and previously were valued at the
last sales price as of the close of options trading on applicable exchanges.
Options traded in the OTC market are valued at the last asked price (options
written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap agreements are valued
by quoted fair values received daily by the Funds' pricing service.
Investments in open-end investment companies are valued at their net asset
value each business day. Securities and other assets for which market
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in
good faith by or under the direction of each Fund's Board of Directors.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--Each Fund may engage in various
portfolio investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to
hedge, or protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in
the securities markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the
contract due to an unfavorable change in the price of the underlying security
or if the counterparty does not perform under the contract. The counterparty
for certain instruments may pledge cash or securities as collateral.

* Financial futures contracts--Each Fund may purchase or sell financial
futures contracts and options on such financial futures contracts. Financial
futures contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a
specific future date and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a
contract, the Fund deposits, and maintains as collateral, such initial margin
as required by the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to
the contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts
or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as
unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

* Options--Each Fund may purchase and write call and put options. When the
Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund is
reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability
is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the
option written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from)
the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a
closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the
extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the
cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received). Written
and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

* Forward interest rate swaps--Each Fund may enter into forward interest rate
swaps. In a forward interest rate swap, the Fund and the counterparty agree to
make periodic net payments on a specified notional contract amount, commencing
on a specified future effective date, unless terminated earlier. When the
agreement is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss in an amount
equal to the value of the agreement.

* Swaps--Each Fund may enter into swap agreements which are OTC contracts in
which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments on a
specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set period of
time or may be triggered by a predetermined credit event. The net periodic
payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate; the change in
market value of a specific security, basket of securities, or index; or the
return generated by a security. These periodic payments received or made by
the Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of Operations as realized
gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are also realized upon
termination of the swap agreements. Swaps are marked-to-market daily and
changes in value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Risks
include changes in the returns of the underlying instruments, failure of the
counterparties to perform under the contracts' terms and the possible lack of
liquidity with respect to the swap agreements.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


(c) Municipal bonds held in trust--BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund,
Inc. invests in leveraged residual certificates ("TOB Residuals") issued by
tender option bond trusts ("TOBs"). A TOB is established by a third party
sponsor forming a special purpose entity, into which a Fund, or an agent on
behalf of the Fund, transfers municipal securities. A TOB typically issues two
classes of beneficial interests: short-term floating rate certificates, which
are sold to third party investors, and residual certificates, which are
generally issued to the Fund which made the transfer or to affiliates of the
Fund. The Fund's transfers of the municipal securities to a TOB do not qualify
for sale treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140
"Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
of Liabilities," therefore the municipal securities deposited into a TOB are
presented in the Fund's schedule of investments and the proceeds from the
transactions are reported as liability for trust certificates. Similarly,
proceeds from residual certificates issued to affiliates, if any, from the
transaction are included in the liability for trust certificates. Interest
income from the underlying security is recorded by the Fund on an accrual
basis. Interest expense incurred on the secured borrowing and other expenses
related to remarketing, administration and trustee services to a TOB are
reported as expenses of a Fund. The floating rate certificates have interest
rates that generally reset weekly and their holders have the option to tender
certificates to the TOB for redemption at par at each reset date. The residual
interests held by the Fund include the right of the Fund (1) to cause the
holders of a proportional share of floating rate certificates to tender their
certificates at par, and (2) to transfer a corresponding share of the municipal
securities from the TOB to the Fund. At May 31, 2007, in reference to BlackRock
Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc., the aggregate value of the underlying
municipal securities transferred to TOBs was $63,347,034. The related liability
for trust certificates was $30,035,000 and the range of interest rates was
3.748% to 3.769%. BlackRock Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc.
did not invest in these types of securities for the six months ended
November 30, 2007.

Financial transactions executed through TOBs generally will underperform the
market for fixed rate municipal bonds in a rising interest rate environment,
but tend to outperform the market for fixed rate bonds when interest rates
decline or remain relatively stable. Should short-term interest rates rise, a
Fund's investments in TOB Residuals likely will adversely affect a Fund's
investment income--net and distributions to shareholders. Fluctuations in the
market value of municipal securities deposited into the TOB may adversely
affect the Funds' net asset value per share.

While the Funds' investment policies and restrictions expressly permit
investments in inverse floating rate securities such as TOB Residuals, they
generally do not allow the Funds to borrow money for purposes of making
investments. The Funds' management believes that the Funds' restrictions on
borrowings do not apply to the secured borrowings deemed to have occurred for
accounting purposes.

(d) Income taxes--It is each Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required.

(e) Security transactions and investment income--Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds amortize all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(f) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(g) Recent accounting pronouncements--Effective June 29, 2007, the Funds
implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation
No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition
threshold a tax position must meet in connection with accounting for
uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken by an
entity, including investment companies, before being measured and recognized
in the financial statements. Management has evaluated the application of FIN
48 to the Funds, and has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 does not have
a material impact on the Funds' financial statements. The Funds file U.S. and
various state tax returns. No income tax returns are currently under
examination. The statute of limitations on the Funds' tax returns remains
open for the years ended May 31, 2004 through May 31, 2007.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair
Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of FAS
157 and its impact on each of the Fund's financial statements, if any, has not
been determined.

In addition, in February 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities" ("FAS 159"), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal
year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also
elects to apply the provisions of FAS 157. FAS 159 permits entities to choose
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities. At this time, management is
evaluating the implications of FAS 159 and its impact on each of the Fund's
financial statements, if any, has not been determined.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


The Funds utilize leveraging to seek to enhance the yields and net asset
values of their Common Stock. However, these objectives cannot be achieved in
all interest rate environments. To leverage, each Fund issues Preferred Stock,
which pays dividends at prevailing short-term interest rates, and invests the
proceeds in long-term municipal bonds. The interest earned on these
investments, net of dividends to Preferred Stock, is paid to Common Stock
shareholders in the form of dividends, and the value of these portfolio
holdings is reflected in the per share net asset value of each Fund's Common
Stock. However, in order to benefit Common Stock shareholders, the yield curve
must be positively sloped; that is, short-term interest rates must be lower
than long-term interest rates. At the same time, a period of generally
declining interest rates will benefit Common Stock shareholders. If either of
these conditions change, then the risks of leveraging will begin to outweigh
the benefits.

To illustrate these concepts, assume a fund's Common Stock capitalization of
$100 million and the issuance of Preferred Stock for an additional $50
million, creating a total value of $150 million available for investment in
long-term municipal bonds. If prevailing short-term interest rates are
approximately 3% and long-term interest rates are approximately 6%, the yield
curve has a strongly positive slope. The fund pays dividends on the $50
million of Preferred Stock based on the lower short-term interest rates. At
the same time, the fund's total portfolio of $150 million earns the income
based on long-term interest rates.

In this case, the dividends paid to Preferred Stock shareholders are
significantly lower than the income earned on the fund's long-term
investments, and therefore the Common Stock shareholders are the beneficiaries
of the incremental yield. However, if short-term interest rates rise,
narrowing the differential between short-term and long-term interest rates,
the incremental yield pickup on the Common Stock will be reduced or eliminated
completely. At the same time, the market value of the fund's Common Stock
(that is, its price as listed on the New York Stock Exchange) may, as a
result, decline. Furthermore, if long-term interest rates rise, the Common
Stock's net asset value will reflect the full decline in the price of the
portfolio's investments, since the value of the fund's Preferred Stock does
not fluctuate. In addition to the decline in net asset value, the market value
of the fund's Common Stock may also decline.

As of November 30, 2007, BlackRock Muni Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. and
BlackRock Muni New York Intermediate Duration Fund, Inc. had leverage amounts,
due to Auction Market Preferred Stock, of 36% and 34% of total net assets,
respectively, before the deduction of Preferred Stock.

As a part of its investment strategy, the Funds may invest in certain
securities whose potential income return is inversely related to changes in a
floating interest rate ("inverse floaters"). In general, income on inverse
floaters will decrease when short-term interest rates increase and increase
when short-term interest rates decrease. Investments in inverse floaters may
be characterized as derivative securities and may subject the Funds to the
risks of reduced or eliminated interest payments and losses of invested
principal. In addition, inverse floaters have the effect of providing
investment leverage and, as a result, the market value of such securities will
generally be more volatile than that of fixed-rate, tax-exempt securities. To
the extent the Funds invest in inverse floaters, the market value of each
Fund's portfolio and the net asset value of each Fund's shares may also be
more volatile than if the Funds did not invest in such securities. (See Note
1(c) to Financial Statements for details of municipal bonds held in trust.)



Swap Agreements


The Funds may invest in swap agreements, which are over-the-counter contracts
in which one party agrees to make periodic payments based on the change in
market value of a specified bond, basket of bonds, or index in return for
periodic payments based on a fixed or variable interest rate or the change in
market value of a different bond, basket of bonds or index. Swap agreements
may be used to obtain exposure to a bond or market without owning or taking
physical custody of securities. Swap agreements involve the risk that the
party with whom each Fund has entered into the swap will default on its
obligation to pay the Funds and the risk that the Funds will not be able to
meet their obligations to pay the other party to the agreement.
