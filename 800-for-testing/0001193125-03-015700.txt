Dear Shareholder:

The philosopher Bertrand Russell famously remarked that, "Change is one thing,
progress is another." You will notice in the following pages that we have begun
to implement some changes to your shareholder report and we will be reflecting
other changes in future reports. Our aim is to make meaningful improvements in
reporting on the management of your Fund and its performance, not just to enact
change for change's sake. Please bear with us during this transition period.

We know that you have questions about Fund managers' decisions and plans, and
we want to be sure that you have easy access to the information you need.
Keeping investors informed is, and always will be, one of my top priorities as
Chairman of your Fund. To that end, we encourage you to contact
Investor Relations at 1-800-SALOMON.

As always, thank you for entrusting your assets with us. We look forward to
helping you continue to meet your financial goals. Please read on to learn more
about your Fund's performance and the Manager's strategy.

Sincerely,

/s/ R. Jay Gerken

MANAGER OVERVIEW


Performance Review

During the 12 months ended April 30, 2003, the Salomon Brothers High Income
Fund II Inc ("Fund") performed very well, generating a total return of 15.58%
based on its net asset value ("NAV") and 15.00% based on its market price,
significantly outperforming the Citigroup High-Yield Market Index,/i/ which
returned 9.64% for the period. Past performance is not indicative of future
results.

During the period, the Fund made distributions to shareholders totaling
$1.38/ii/ per share. The table below shows the 12-month total returns based on
the Fund's April 30, 2003 NAV per share and its New York Stock Exchange
("NYSE") closing price./iii/

U.S. HIGH-YIELD DEBT

A Challenging Start

During the first three months of the Fund's fiscal year, a series of factors
weakened investor confidence, which had already reached a fragile state. The
factors included additional reports of fraudulent accounting practices,
earnings restatements by corporations and a large number of credit downgrades
of corporate bonds by ratings agencies. As a result of the increased market
volatility and investor uncertainty, both high-yield and investment-grade bond
issues dropped in price and their yields correspondingly rose to levels
comparable to those on non-investment-grade ("high-yield") bonds. In June,
WorldCom Inc.'s disclosure that it had improperly accounted for $3.8 billion of
expenses caused investors to avoid sectors characterized by companies with more
complex financials, and this increased the risk premium for high-yield bonds.
The market had declined significantly by the end of July with the arrest of
senior executives at Adelphia Communications and WorldCom's Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing.

The high-yield market regained some ground for a period in August amid
perceptions that the economy was improving. However, the rally proved
short-lived and the market subsequently retreated due to concerns about
mounting tensions in Iraq, warnings about lower corporate earnings, and new
economic data and other signals that raised doubts about the strength of the
economy. As a result of the strong sell-off in the market during the first half
of the Fund's fiscal year, by the end of October high-yield bond yields, which
move opposite to prices, increased to 13.36% (as measured by the yield of the
Citigroup High-Yield Market Index).

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC



High Yield Market Rebound

When the economy is weak, the Federal Reserve ("Fed") may consider lowering its
interest rate targets to help stimulate economic activity. The rationale is
that if rates proceed to decline, consumers and corporations can borrow more
cheaply and may be inclined to spend more, pumping money into the economy.
Following an economic report released in October that reflected a weak labor
market, the Fed reduced its target for the federal funds rate/iv/ by half a
percentage point in early November to a four-decade low of 1.25%. The most
significant headway in the high-yield market occurred after this time.

The market advanced amid considerably stronger inflows of cash compared to
earlier periods in the year. Perceptions that the economy was improving,
coupled with favorable yields available in the market, supported interest in
high-yield bonds. The declining default rate of corporate bonds (i.e., the
number of companies failing to make timely interest payments to bondholders)
also proved encouraging to the market. Reports of corporate accounting
improprieties that made front-page headlines during the spring, which created a
dimmer environment for the high-yield market at that time, became less
pronounced. Furthermore, the requirement by the Securities and Exchange
Commission last summer that principal executive officers and company directors
certify the accuracy of their companies' financial statements appeared to have
restored some investor confidence in the integrity of corporate financial
reporting practices.

In 2003, the high-yield market continued to rally as investors seeking to put
money on the sidelines to work bid up prices of bonds. Despite more pronounced
concerns about war with Iraq throughout the first calendar quarter of this
year, the trend of declining default rates continued to generate more investor
confidence in the strength of high-yield bonds. Furthermore, the end of the
conflict sparked additional demand for high-yield bonds as investors shifted
their focus from geopolitical tensions to the fact that first quarter earnings
at many companies were in line with estimates and the stock market was
recovering.

Analysis of Fund's High-Yield Component

In terms of its performance, the Fund benefited from its overweighted exposure
to bonds from issuers in the consumer products, technology, wireless
telecommunications and tower industries and through its underweighted exposure
to the wireline telecommunications, automotive and airline industries relative
to the Citigroup High-Yield Market Index. However, the Fund was adversely
affected by its overweighted exposure to the cable industry and through its
underweighted exposure to the energy industry relative to the index.

Over the past year, the Fund's corporate high-yield position increased its
exposure to the beleaguered investment-grade corporate bond sector,
particularly the issues of large-cap companies. After the crisis of confidence
in Corporate America sparked by reports of various financial improprieties and
the fall-out at Enron Corp. and WorldCom, the issues of even solid, blue-chip
companies came under heavy scrutiny and were oversold. We used this opportunity
to increase holdings in corporate issues of what we considered to be solid
companies that, in our view, were competitively priced. The Fund and high-yield
market benefited as the crisis in confidence subsided and high-grade corporate
issues rebounded.

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC



As of the period's close, while the Fund was invested in a diversified array of
sectors, it maintained significant exposure to the media-and-cable sector.
During the past year, we increased the Fund's exposure to cable issues that we
perceived were oversold following the reported problems at Adelphia
Communications, which negatively impacted the sector. The Fund also maintained
heavier exposure to telecommunication issues for similar reasons, as that
sector likewise came under selling pressure following the WorldCom situation.
The Fund also maintained heavier exposure to energy issues versus many other
sectors because we believed they would fluctuate less and for diversification.

Competitive Yields

Recent market valuations appear to have discounted much of the negative news
that transpired during 2002. At the end of April, the high-yield market offered
very competitive levels of income.

EMERGING MARKETS DEBT

Emerging markets debt/vi/ returned 21.27% for the period, as measured by the
J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus ("EMBI+")./vii/ During the period,
EMBI+ sovereign spreads tightened by 43 basis points closing at 576 basis
points over U.S. Treasuries. The 12-month return volatility was approximately
10%.

The markets for emerging markets debt remained volatile during the first half
of the reporting period but staged a year-end rally that continued into April
of 2003. Despite the military conflict in Iraq, several high-profile elections
in some emerging market countries and high volatility in global equity markets,
country performance was solid as the markets of all countries reflected in the
EMBI+ posted gains for the period. Developments in Latin America, namely
presidential elections in Brazil and Ecuador, drove overall market performance
as they welcomed ambitious political and economic reform programs that the
newly elected leaders in these countries embarked on.

The market rally for emerging markets debt was also supported by high oil
prices, an important driver of revenues for many emerging market economies.
During the period, oil prices increased to almost $40 per barrel. Moreover, the
market enjoyed positive market technicals (i.e., increased inflows combined
with the re-investment of coupon and amortization payments).

Our active asset allocation process proved to be beneficial for the Fund. At
the beginning of the fiscal period, the Fund was long emerging markets debt,
which accounted for approximately 32% of the Fund. It positively contributed to
the performance of the Fund as emerging markets debt outperformed high yield
bonds (e.g., U.S. high-yield issues). Later during the period, we decided to
reduce the Fund's exposure to emerging markets due to negative developments in
Argentina as well as to expected volatility surrounding elections in Brazil and
Ecuador. Our emerging markets debt allocation accounted for as
little as approximately 8% of the Fund last July, which positively contributed
to the Fund's performance as the emerging markets debt was performing poorly
during that time. With the elections and

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC


uncertainties surrounding them behind us, we decided to increase our allocation
to emerging markets debt at the beginning of 2003. That allowed us to
participate in the rally in these markets that, as of the period's close, was
still in progress. As of April 30th, the emerging markets debt component
constituted over 19% of total investments of the Fund.

Developments in some of the key emerging markets over the period are described
below. (The performances of the following debt markets are measured by the
EMBI+.)/viii/

Russia. Posting a gain of 32.49% for the period, Russia ranked as the
best-performing market in the EMBI+. Despite the slowdown of industrial
production, Russia's macroeconomic fundamentals remained strong, mainly due to
a strong rebound in export-oriented and capital goods industries. High oil
prices continued to spur credit quality improvements as foreign currency
reserves exceeded $50 billion. Last December, Moody's Investors Service
upgraded Russia's credit rating to Ba2. While we are happy with Russia's
progress, we have reduced the Fund's exposure to this market, as we are
concerned that Russian bond prices may have overshot real economic improvements
in the country. Within the emerging markets debt component of the Fund, we have
recently been underweight Russian debt./ix/

Brazil. Due to its large weighting in the EMBI+ (approximately 22%), Brazil
influences the overall return of the markets in the index. The market posted a
gain of 25.25% for the period, and while these returns outpaced the market,
Brazil performed poorly before the presidential elections in October. Weak
performance was caused by investors' concerns about future economic policies of
the Lula De Silva administration. Throughout much of 2002, investors were
convinced that Lula would not be elected president. His steady progress in the
polls and ultimate victory in elections, in our view, led many investors to
sell Brazilian debt. Following several of our trips to Brazil, we believed that
Lula would implement market-friendly policies and that the market would
eventually embrace his victory. Accordingly, we took advantage of the sell-off
and began adding to the Fund's exposure to Brazilian debt. As we expected,
Brazilian debt rebounded after elections as markets reacted favorably to
market- friendly comments from Lula and his top advisers. Within the emerging
markets debt component of the Fund, we have maintained an overweight position
in Brazilian debt./ix/

Ecuador. Returning 21.85%, Ecuador ended the fiscal period on a strong positive
note. On March 21st, the International Monetary Fund ("IMF")/x/ approved a
$205-million agreement for Ecuador. This agreement was reached by the
government after just two months in office. The previous administration
negotiated with the IMF over a 14-month period and failed to reach an
agreement. The market appeared to interpret this agreement as being indicative
of the new government's determination to implement prudent fiscal measures.
Following this approval, Fitch Ratings, a nationally recognized credit ratings
service, revised its rating outlook on Ecuador's CCC+ rating from "stable" to
"positive." Ecuador's economy also continued to benefit from high oil prices.
Within the emerging markets debt component of the Fund, we have recently been
overweighted Ecuador./ix/

Mexico. Its strong credit fundamentals combined with higher oil prices
supported the performance of Mexico's debt market, which returned 18.51% for
the period. Mexico's strong fiscal position has enabled the country to avoid
budget cuts in the current economic slowdown. The Fund has recently had a
market-weight in Mexico relative to the EMBI+./ix/

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC



Turkey. Despite the significant volatility it experienced during the period,
Turkey managed to post a gain of 9.40% for the period. At the beginning of the
period, the country's geo-strategic importance combined with significant IMF
support attracted investor interest. The domestic economy stabilized with a
return of investor confidence, a decline in interest rates, and a stronger
currency. In addition, the market reacted positively to the outcome of the
November general elections that were won by the Justice and Development Party
("AKP"). Financial markets, however, reacted negatively to Turkey's refusal to
grant the U.S. the right to use its airspace as well as to deploy troops on
Turkish soil during the war with Iraq. This decision by the Turkish parliament
caused the loss of a $30 billion economic aid package from the U.S. On the back
of expectations that the war in Iraq would end earlier than expected, Turkey
recovered some of the losses in April. Investors believed that the impact of
the war on the Turkish economy might be milder than initially feared. Around
the time of Turkey's refusal to grant U.S. troops deployment, we decreased our
allocation to Turkey from overweight to underweight within the emerging markets
debt component of the Fund./ix/

Venezuela. Returning 4.57% for the period, Venezuela was the worst performer in
the EMBI+. Although the two-month general strike organized by opposition
parties has been generally lifted and oil production has started to recover,
many market observers feel it will take a long time to overcome the devastating
impact it had on the domestic economy and especially its oil sector, the
largest generator of tax revenues. Despite the apparent recovery in oil output,
the need for financing remains high due to additional downward pressures on the
economy from high inflation and currency depreciation. Venezuelan debt also
remains vulnerable due to the volatile political environment. The Fund has
continued to have a very limited exposure to Venezuela./ix/

Yields Support Investor Interest

As of the period's close, higher yields available through emerging markets debt
continued to support investor interest in these markets.

SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Salomon Brothers High Income Fund II Inc ("Fund") was incorporated in Maryland
and is registered as a diversified, closed-end, management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Fund seeks to
maximize current income by investing at least 80% of its net assets plus any
borrowings for investment purposes in high yield debt securities (as defined in
the Fund's prospectus). As a secondary objective, the Fund seeks capital
appreciation to the extent consistent with its objective of seeking to maximize
current income.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Actual amounts could differ from those
estimates.

(a) SECURITIES VALUATION. In valuing the Fund's assets, all securities for
which market quotations are readily available are valued (i) at the last sale
price prior to the time of determination if there were a sale on the date of
determination, (ii) at the mean between the last current bid and asked prices
if there were no sales on such date and bid and asked quotations are available,
and (iii) at the bid price if there were no sales price on such date and only
bid quotations are available. Publicly traded foreign government debt
securities are typically traded internationally in the over-the-counter market,
and are valued at the mean between the last current bid and asked price as of
the close of business of that market. However, when the spread between bid and
asked price exceeds five percent of the par value of the security, the security
is valued at the bid price. Securities may also be valued by independent
pricing services which use prices provided by market-makers or estimates of
market values obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities
with similar characteristics. Short-term investments having a maturity of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value.
Securities for which reliable quotations are not readily available and all
other securities and assets are valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by, or under procedures established by, the Board of Directors.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. Investment transactions are recorded on the trade
date. Interest income is accrued on a daily basis. Market discount or premium
on securities purchased is accreted or amortized, respectively, on an effective
yield basis over the life of the security. The Fund uses the specific
identification method for determining realized gain or loss on investments.
Dividend income is recorded on ex-dividend date.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)


(c) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. The Fund has complied and intends to continue to
comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated
investment companies, and to distribute all of its income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax or excise tax provision is required.

(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. The Fund declares and pays dividends to
shareholders monthly from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, in
excess of loss carryovers are expected to be distributed annually. Dividends
and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The
amount of dividends and distributions from net investment income and net
realized gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from GAAP. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the components of net
assets.

(e) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. When entering into repurchase agreements, it is the
Fund's policy to take possession, through its custodian, of the underlying
collateral and to monitor its value at the time the arrangement is entered into
and during the term of the repurchase agreement to ensure that it equals or
exceeds the repurchase price. In the event of default of the obligation to
repurchase, the Fund has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the
proceeds in satisfaction of the obligation. Under certain circumstances, in the
event of default or bankruptcy by the other party to the agreement, realization
and/or retention of the collateral may be subject to legal proceedings.

(f) YEAR END TAX RECLASSIFICATIONS. The character of income and gains to be
distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from GAAP. At April 30, 2003, reclassifications were made to the capital
accounts of the Fund to reflect permanent book/tax differences and income and
gains available for distributions under income tax regulations. Net investment
income, net realized loss and net assets were not affected by this change.

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc ("Investment Manager"), an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment
manager to the Fund. The Investment Manager is responsible on a day-to-day
basis for the management of the Fund's portfolio in accordance with the Fund's
investment objectives and policies and for making decisions to buy, sell or
hold particular securities of the Fund. The management fee for these services
is payable monthly at an annual rate of 1.00% of the Fund's average weekly net
assets plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("Administrator"), another indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, acts as the Fund's administrator for
which the Fund pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.10% of the value of
the Fund's average weekly net assets plus the

                                                                        Page 27

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage. The administrator
performs certain administrative services necessary for the operation of the
Fund.

During periods in which the Fund is utilizing financial leverage, the fees
which are payable to the Investment Manager and Administrator as a percentage
of the Fund's assets will be higher than if the Fund did not utilize leverage
because the fees are calculated as a percentage of the Fund's assets, including
those investments purchased with leverage.

At April 30, 2003, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM"), formerly known as
Salomon Smith Barney Inc., another indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Citigroup, held 10.963 shares of the Fund.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are also officers and/or
directors of the Investment Manager.

NOTE 3. PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

During the year ended April 30, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
securities, but excluding short-term securities) were as follows:

<TABLE>
           <S>                                           <C>

                                                         ============
</TABLE>

At April 30, 2003, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation
of investments for Federal income tax purposes were as follows:

<TABLE>
          <S>                                           <C>
          Gross unrealized appreciation................ $105,049,077
          Gross unrealized depreciation................  (90,698,154)

          Net unrealized appreciation.................. $ 14,350,923
                                                        ============
</TABLE>

NOTE 4. LENDING OF PORTFOLIO SECURITIES

The Fund has an agreement with its custodian whereby the custodian may lend
securities owned by the Fund to brokers, dealers and other financial
organizations, and receives a lenders fee. Fees earned by the Fund on
securities lending are recorded in interest income. Loans of securities by the
Fund are collateralized by cash, U.S. government securities or high quality
money market instruments that are maintained at all times in an amount at least
equal to the current market value of the securities loaned, plus a margin which
may vary depending on the type of securities loaned. The custodian establishes
and maintains the collateral in a segregated account. The Fund maintains
exposure for the risk of any losses in the investment of amounts received as
collateral.


Page 28

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC



NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

At April 30, 2003, the Fund loaned securities having a market value of
$118,986,361. The Fund received cash collateral amounting to $121,446,606 which
was invested into the State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust Prime
Portfolio.

Income earned by the Fund from securities lending for the year ended April 30,
2003 was $180,963.

NOTE 5. LOAN PARTICIPATIONS

The Fund invests in fixed and floating rate loans arranged through private
negotiations between a foreign sovereign entity and one or more financial
institutions. The Fund's investment in any such loan may be in the form of a
participation in or an assignment of the loan.

In connection with purchasing participations, the Fund generally will have no
right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan
agreement relating to the loan, nor any rights of set-off against the borrower,
and the Fund may not benefit directly from any collateral supporting the loan
in which it has purchased the participation. As a result, the Fund will assume
the credit risk of both the borrower and the lender that is selling the
participation. In the event of the insolvency of the lender selling the
participation, the Fund may be treated as a general creditor of the lender and
may not benefit from any set-off between the lender and the borrower.

At April 30, 2003, the Fund held loan participations with a total cost of
$5,943,316.

NOTE 6. CREDIT RISK

The yields of emerging markets debt obligations and high-yield corporate debt
obligations reflect, among other things, perceived credit risk. The Fund's
investment in securities rated below investment grade typically involves risks
not associated with higher rated securities including, among others, overall
greater risk of timely and ultimate payment of interest and principal, greater
market price volatility and less liquid secondary market trading. The
consequences of political, social, economic or diplomatic changes may have
disruptive effects on the market prices of investments held by the Fund.

NOTE 7. CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARD

At April 30, 2003, the Fund had, for Federal income tax purposes, approximately
$253,973,000 of unused capital loss carryforwards available to offset future
capital gains. To the extent that these carryforward losses are used to offset
capital gains, it is probable that any gains so offset will not be distributed.

                                                                        Page 29

NOTE 9. LOAN

At April 30, 2003, the Fund had outstanding a $300,000,000 loan pursuant to a
revolving credit and security agreement with CXC Inc., an affiliate of
Citigroup, a commercial paper conduit issuer for which Citicorp North America
Inc., an affiliate of the Investment Manager, acts as administrative agent. The
loans generally bear interest at a variable rate based on the weighted average
interest rates of the underlying commercial paper or LIBOR, plus any applicable
margin. Securities held by the Fund are subject to a lien, granted to the
lenders, to the extent of the borrowing outstanding and any additional
expenses. For the year ended April 30, 2003, the Fund paid interest expense of
$5,897,244.

NOTE 10. DIVIDENDS SUBSEQUENT TO APRIL 30, 2003

On January 23, 2003, the Board of Directors of the Fund declared dividends in

period May 28, 1998 (commencement of operations) through April 30, 1999, in

/(1)/The Fund's Board of Directors is divided into three classes: Class I,
     Class II and Class III. The terms of office of the Class I, II and III
     Directors expire at the Annual Meetings of Stockholders in the year 2005,
     year 2003, and year 2004, respectively, or thereafter in each case when
     their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. The Fund's
     executive officers are chosen each year at the first meeting of the Fund's
     Board of Directors following the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to hold
     office until the meeting of the Board following the next Annual Meeting of
     Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.
/(2)/Mr. Gerken is a Director who is an "interested person" of the Fund as
     defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, because Mr.
     Gerken is an officer of SBFM and certain of its affiliates.

SALOMON BROTHERS HIGH INCOME FUND II INC



DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited)

Pursuant to certain rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission the
following additional disclosure is provided.

Each shareholder purchasing shares of common stock ("Shares") of Salomon
Brothers High Income Fund II Inc ("Fund") will be deemed to have elected to be
a participant in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), unless the
shareholder specifically elects in writing (addressed to the Agent at the
address below or to any nominee who holds Shares for the shareholder in its
name) to receive all income dividends and distributions of capital gains in
cash, paid by check, mailed directly to the record holder by or under the
direction of PFPC Global Fund Services, formerly known as First Data Investor
Services Group, Inc. as the Fund's dividend-paying agent ("Agent"). A
shareholder whose Shares are held in the name of a broker or nominee who does
not provide an automatic reinvestment service may be required to take such
Shares out of "street name" and register such Shares in the shareholder's name
in order to participate, otherwise dividends and distributions will be paid in
cash to such shareholder by the broker or nominee. Each participant in the Plan
is referred to herein as a "Participant." The Agent will act as Agent for each
Participant, and will open accounts for each Participant under the Plan in the
same name as their Shares are registered.

Unless the Fund declares a dividend or distribution payable only in the form of
cash, the Agent will apply all dividends and distributions in the manner set
forth below.

If, on the determination date (as defined below), the market price per Share
equals or exceeds the net asset value per Share on that date (such condition, a
"market premium"), the Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in newly
issued Shares of the Fund on behalf of Participants. If, on the determination
date, the net asset value per Share exceeds the market price per Share (such
condition, a "market discount"), the Agent will purchase Shares in the open
market. The determination date will be the fourth New York Stock Exchange
trading day (a New York Stock Exchange trading day being referred to herein as
a "Trading Day") preceding the payment date for the dividend or distribution.
For purposes herein, "market price" will mean the average of the highest and
lowest prices at which the Shares sell on the New York Stock Exchange on the
particular date, or if there is no sale on that date, the average of the
closing bid and asked quotations.

Purchases made by the Agent will be made as soon as practicable commencing on
the Trading Day following the determination date and terminating no later than
30 days after the dividend or distribution payment date except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities law; provided, however, that such purchases
will, in any event, terminate on the Trading Day prior to the "ex-dividend"
date next succeeding the dividend or distribution payment date.

If (i) the Agent has not invested the full dividend amount in open market
purchases by the date specified at the bottom of the prior page as the date on
which such purchases must terminate

                                                                        Page 37

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

or (ii) a market discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase
period, then the Agent will cease making open market purchases and will receive
the uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued Shares (x) in the
case of (i) above, at the close of business on the date the Agent is required
to terminate making open market purchases as specified at the bottom of the
prior page or (y) in the case of (ii) above, at the close of business on the
date such shift occurs; but in no event prior to the payment date for the
dividend or distribution.

In the event that all or part of a dividend or distribution amount is to be
paid in newly issued Shares, such Shares will be issued to Participants in
accordance with the following formula: (i) if, on the valuation date, the net
asset value per share is less than or equal to the market price per Share, then
the newly issued Shares will be valued at net asset value per Share on the
valuation date provided, however, that if the net asset value is less than 95%
of the market price on the valuation date, then such Shares will be issued at
95% of the market price and (ii) if, on the valuation date, the net asset value
per share is greater than the market price per Share, then the newly issued
Shares will be issued at the market price on the valuation date. The valuation
date will be the dividend or distribution payment date, except that with
respect to Shares issued pursuant to the paragraph above, the valuation date
will be the date such Shares are issued. If a date that would otherwise be a
valuation date is not a Trading Day, the valuation date will be the next
preceding Trading Day.

The open market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities
exchange on which the Shares of the Fund are traded, in the over-the-counter
market or in negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price,
delivery and otherwise as the Agent shall determine. Funds held by the Agent
uninvested will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any event, the
Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability to purchase
Shares within the time periods herein provided, or with the timing of any
purchases effected. The Agent shall have no responsibility as to the value of
the Shares acquired for the Participant's account. The Agent may commingle
amounts of all Participants to be used for open market purchases of Shares and
the price per Share allocable to each Participant in connection with such
purchases shall be the average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
Shares purchased by the Agent.

The Agent will maintain all Participant accounts in the Plan and will furnish
written confirmations of all transactions in each account, including
information needed by Participants for personal and tax records. The Agent will
hold Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan in noncertificated form in the
Participant's name or that of its nominee, and each Participant's proxy will
include those Shares purchased pursuant to the Plan. The Agent will forward to
Participants any proxy solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held
for Participants only in accordance with the proxy returned by Participants to
the Fund. Upon written request, the Agent will deliver to Participants, without
charge, a certificate or certificates for the full Shares.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)


The Agent will confirm to Participants each acquisition made for their
respective accounts as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the
date thereof. Although Participants may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share of the Fund,
no certificates for fractional shares will be issued. Dividends and
distributions on fractional shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the
market value of the Fund's Shares at the time of termination less the pro rata
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any share dividends or split shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Agent for Participants will be credited to their respective accounts. In
the event that the Fund makes available to Participants rights to purchase
additional Shares or other securities, the Shares held for Participants under
the Plan will be added to other Shares held by the Participants in calculating
the number of rights to be issued to Participants.

The Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged a pro rata
share of brokerage commissions on all open market purchases.

Participants may terminate their accounts under the Plan by notifying the Agent
in writing or by calling 1-800-331-1710. Such termination will be effective
immediately if notice is received by the Agent not less than ten days prior to
any dividend or distribution record date; otherwise such termination will be
effective on the first Trading Day after the payment due for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be amended or terminated by the Fund as applied to any dividend or capital
gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the change or
termination sent to Participants at least 30 days prior to the record date for
the dividend or capital gains distribution. The Plan may be amended or
terminated by the Agent, with the Fund's prior written consent, on at least 30
days' written notice to Plan Participants. Notwithstanding the preceding two
sentences, the Agent or the Fund may amend or supplement the Plan at any time
or times when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law or rules
or policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other regulatory
authority. Upon any termination, the Agent will cause a certificate or
certificates for the full Shares held by each Participant under the Plan and
cash adjustment for any fraction to be delivered to each Participant without
charge. If the Participant elects by notice to the Agent in writing in advance
of such termination to have the Agent sell part or all of a Participant's
Shares and remit the proceeds to Participant, the Agent is authorized to deduct
a $2.50 fee plus brokerage commission for this transaction from the proceeds.

Any amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each Participant
unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Agent receives written notice
of the termination of the Participant's account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the

                                                                        Page 39

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

Agent in its place and stead of a successor Agent under these terms and
conditions, with full power and authority to perform all or any of the acts to
be performed by the Agent under these terms and conditions. Upon any such
appointment of an Agent for the purpose of receiving dividends and
distributions, the Fund will be authorized to pay to such successor Agent, for
each Participant's account, all dividends and distributions payable on Shares
of the Fund held in each Participant's name or under the Plan for retention or
application by such successor Agent as provided in these terms and conditions.

In the case of Participants, such as banks, broker-dealers or other nominees,
which hold Shares for others who are beneficial owners ("Nominee Holders"), the
Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Shares certified
from time to time by each Nominee Holder as representing the total amount
registered in the Nominee Holder's name and held for the account of beneficial
owners who are to participate in the Plan.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and use its best efforts within
reasonable limits to insure the accuracy of all services performed under this
Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility and
shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by its negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of its
employees.

All correspondence concerning the Plan should be directed to the Agent at P.O.
Box 8030, Boston, Massachusetts 02266-8030.
