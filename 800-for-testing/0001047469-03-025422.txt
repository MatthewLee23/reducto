                      IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING DELIVERY
                            OF SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits mutual funds to deliver
only one copy of shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements
and shareholder reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same
residential or post office box address. This practice is often called
"householding" and it helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER, MAY HOUSEHOLD THE MAILING OF YOUR
DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.

From time to time mutual funds are required to vote proxies related to the
securities held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying
Portfolios vote proxies according to a set of policies and procedures
approved by the Funds' and Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description
of these policies and procedures without charge, upon request, by calling
1-800-262-1122. This description is also available on the Securities and
Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF MAY 31, 2003
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO Of THOMAS J. FETTER]
Thomas J. Fetter
President

In our shareholder reports, we refer frequently to "quality spreads" and their
important role in bond analysis. However, while followed closely by bond
analysts and portfolio managers, this aspect of municipal bond investing is
generally overlooked by individual investors. As part of our continuing
educational series, we thought it might be instructive to discuss quality
spreads and why they constitute a key variable for investors in the municipal
bond market.

Quality spreads: compensation for added credit risk...

The term "quality spread" refers to the difference in yields between bonds of
varying quality, but similar maturities. A bond rated BBB, for example, should
have a higher yield than an insured bond rated AAA, because investors who buy
lower-quality bonds expect to be paid for accepting a higher level of credit
risk. That risk premium comes in the form of higher yields. Spreads are
typically stated in basis points, or 1/100's of a percentage point. Thus, a bond
yielding 5.00% trades at a spread of 100 basis points (1.00%) over a bond that
yields 4.00%.

Spread fluctuations are influenced by a variety of factors...

Spreads fluctuate with changes in market conditions, with many factors
influencing spread relationships. The quality and type of bond are primary
factors. For example, an insured general obligation rated AAA - with no credit
risk - will trade at a significantly lower yield than a BBB-rated industrial
bond, which has a significantly higher credit risk. Naturally, a bond's price
will respond to changes that may impact - for better or worse - the underlying
fundamentals of an issuer. Remember, bond yields move in the opposite direction
of bond prices.

Another factor that influences spreads is supply. Assuming stable demand,
spreads are likely to widen if the supply for a specific issuer increases, as
the market must now digest a larger volume of bonds. Similarly, if supply
declines, spreads may narrow, as investors may be willing to pay more for a
credit that is increasingly scarce.

Finally, quality spreads may fluctuate with changes in the overall economy. For
example, spreads tend to narrow as the economy strengthens and the revenue
outlook improves. On the other hand, as the economy slows or enters recession,
spreads tend to widen, as investors become increasingly worried about the
direction of the economy and its impact on bonds with higher credit risk.

Spreads constitute a key factor in investment decisions...

Quality spreads have a significant influence on the investment decisions of
municipal bond portfolio managers. The widening of spreads may suggest a
developing opportunity. If spreads have widened appreciably, the investor may
detect an unusual opportunity in a lower-quality, higher-yielding bond.
Conversely, if lower-quality bonds have significantly outperformed high-quality
bonds over a period, the resulting narrowing of spreads may signal the need for
caution. This "spread compression" may prompt portfolio managers to upgrade
their portfolios with higher-quality bonds because they are no longer being
adequately compensated for the risk of owning lower-quality bonds.

While quality spreads are a key metric for municipal bond investors, they
represent just one of many factors considered in establishing a diversified bond
portfolio. At Eaton Vance, we realize that complex markets require intensive
research, a need that emphasizes once again the value of experienced,
professional portfolio management.

                                       Sincerely,
                                       /s/ Thomas J. Fetter

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF MAY 31, 2003
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

[PHOTO OF THOMAS M. METZOLD]
Thomas M. Metzold
Portfolio Manager

Investment Environment

- -    The U.S. economy, which has slumped badly in recent years, remained
     sluggish in the first half of 2003, although there were sporadic signs of
     improvement. Gross Domestic Product expanded 1.9% in the first quarter of
     2003, following a 1.4% rise in the fourth quarter of 2002. The nation's
     unemployment rate climbed to 6.1% in May 2003, the highest monthly jobless
     rate since July 1994.

- -    In that environment, the Federal Reserve maintained an accommodative
     monetary posture. The Federal Funds rate - a key short-term interest rate
     barometer - stood at 1.25%, a 40-year low, at May 31, 2003 (It was lowered
     to 1.00% in June 2003).

- -    Ten-year Treasury Bond yields - which were 5.04% at May 31, 2002 - declined
     to 3.39% by May 31, 2003, in response to the tepid economy. The sharp
     decline in rates was greeted warmly by investors wary of the volatile
     equity markets and helped to sustain a rally in bonds. The Lehman Brothers
     Municipal Bond Index - a broad-based, unmanaged index of municipal bonds -
     had a total return of 6.46% for the six months ended May 31, 2003.(1)

The Trust

Performance for the Past Six Months

- -    Based on share price (traded on the New York Stock Exchange), the Trust had
     a total return of 11.62% for the six months ended May 31, 2003. That return
     was the result of an increase in share price from $14.05 on November 30,
     2002 to $15.06 on May 31, 2003, and the reinvestment of $0.555 in regular
     monthly dividends.(2)

- -    Based on net asset value, the Trust had a total return of 11.98% for the
     six months ended May 31, 2003. That return was the result of an increase in
     net asset value per share from $13.02 on November 30, 2002 to $14.00 on May
     31, 2003, and the reinvestment of $0.555 in regular monthly dividends.

- -    Based on the most recent dividend and a share price of $15.06, the Trust
     had a market yield of 7.37% at May 31, 2003.(3) The Trust's market yield is
     equivalent to a taxable yield of 11.34%.(4)

Management Discussion

- -    The Trust was well served by its broad diversification. In addition to
     diversifying according to issuer, sector and insurer, management had a
     mixed coupon allocation, balancing income-oriented higher-coupons with
     performance-minded low- and zero-coupon bonds.

- -    The Trust's largest sector concentration was in hospital bonds. Management
     remained very selective with respect to hospital investments, focusing on
     the more competitive institutions, with favorable cost structures,
     in-demand care specialties and alliances with other hospitals.

- -    Insured* transportation bonds represented a large investment for the Trust.
     Given the nation's vast geography, the efficient transport of passengers
     and freight is a key segment of the U.S. economy. The Trust's investments
     included issues for highways, turnpikes, airport authorities and mass
     transit.

- -    Insured* general obligations (GOs) were another major focus for the Trust.
     In a slow economy, many states and municipalities have encountered a
     shortfall in income and sales tax receipts. In that climate, insured* GOs
     provided some insulation from revenue uncertainty.

*Private insurance does not remove the risk of loss of principal associated with
insured investments due to changes in market conditions.

THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND ARE
CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS STATED ON THE COVER.
THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED UPON MARKET OR OTHER
CONDITIONS, AND EATON VANCE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE SUCH VIEWS.
THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE AND, BECAUSE INVESTMENT
DECISIONS FOR A FUND ARE BASED ON MANY FACTORS, MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN
INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF OF ANY FUND.

(1)  It is not possible to invest directly in an Index.

(2)  A portion of the Trust's income may be subject to federal income tax and/or
     federal alternative minimum tax. Income may be subject to state tax.

(3)  The Trust's market yield is calculated by dividing the most recent dividend
     per share by the share price at the end of the period and annualizing the
     result.

(4)  Taxable-equivalent yield assumes maximum 35.0% federal income tax rate. A
     lower rate would result in a lower tax-equivalent figure.

(5)  Rating Distribution is determined by dividing the total market value of the
     holdings by the total investments of the Trust. Rating Distribution is
     subject to change.

(6)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in share price or net asset value with all distributions reinvested.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and market
price will fluctuate so that shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than
their original cost.

 ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their obligations may
 be affected by economic developments in a specific industry or municipality.

 backed by bond insurance of various financial institutions and financial
 guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by financial
 institutions ranged from 3.8% to 15.8% of total investments.

 (1)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act
      of 1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.
 (2)  Security has been issued as a leveraged inverse floater bond.
 (3)  Security has been issued as an inverse floater bond.
 (4)  Non-income producing security.

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF MAY 31, 2003

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1 Significant Accounting Policies
- -------------------------------------------
   Eaton Vance Municipal Income Trust (the Trust) is an entity commonly known as
   a Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
   Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.
   The Trust was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
   by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated December 10, 1998. The Trust's
   investment objective is to achieve current income exempt from regular federal
   income tax by investing primarily in investment grade municipal obligations.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
   followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
   policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

 A Investment Valuation -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
   valuations furnished by a pricing service. Taxable obligations, if any, for
   which price quotations are readily available are normally valued at the mean
   between the latest bid and asked prices. Futures contracts listed on the
   commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement prices. Short-term
   obligations, maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost,
   which approximates value. Investments for which valuations or market
   quotations are unavailable are valued at fair value using methods determined
   in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

 B Investment Transactions -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

 C Income -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
   adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

 D Federal Income Taxes -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions
   of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and
   to distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, if any,
   and tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments.
   Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At
   November 30, 2002, the Trust, for federal income tax purposes, had a capital
   loss carryover of $29,387,222 which will reduce the taxable income arising
   from future net realized gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted
   by the Internal Revenue Code and thus will reduce the amount of distributions
   to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trust of
   any liability for federal income or excise tax. Such capital loss carryover
   will expire on November 30, 2007 ($9,497,591) November 30, 2008 ($14,623,294)
   and November 30, 2009 ($5,266,337). In addition, the Trust intends to satisfy
   conditions which will enable it to designate distributions from the interest
   income generated by its investments in municipal obligations, which are
   exempt from regular federal income taxes when received by the Trust, as
   exempt-interest dividends. The portion of such interest, if any, earned on
   private activity bonds issued after August 7, 1986, may be considered a tax
   preference item for investors.

 E Financial Futures Contracts -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
   contract, the Trust is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
   securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by the Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Trust. The Trust's
   investment in financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging
   against anticipated future changes in interest rates and investment purposes.
   Should interest rates move unexpectedly, the Trust may not achieve the
   anticipated benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a
   loss.

 F Options on Financial Futures Contracts -- Upon the purchase of a put option
   on a financial futures contract by the Trust, the premium paid is recorded as
   an investment, the value of which is marked-to-market daily. When a purchased
   option expires, the Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of
   the option. When the Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, the Trust
   will realize a gain or loss depending on whether the sales proceeds from the
   closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option.
   When the Trust exercises a put option, settlement is made in cash. The risk
   associated with purchasing put options is limited to the premium originally
   paid.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) CONT'D

 G Interest Rate Swaps -- The Trust has entered into interest rate swap
   agreements to enhance return, to hedge against fluctuations in securities
   prices or interest rates or as substitution for the purchase or sale of
   securities. Pursuant to these agreements, the Trust makes semi-annual
   payments at a fixed interest rate. In exchange, the Trust receives payments
   based on the interest rate of a benchmark industry index. During the term of
   the outstanding swap agreement, changes in the underlying value of the swap
   are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. Payments received or made at the
   end of a measurement period are recorded as realized gains and losses. The
   value of the swap is determined by changes in the relationship between two
   rates of interest. The Trust is exposed to credit loss in the event of
   non-performance by the swap counterparty. However, the Trust does not
   anticipate non-performance by the counterparty. Risk may also arise from the
   unanticipated movements in value of interest rates.

 H Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 I Expense Reduction -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as custodian
   of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a fee reduced
   by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash balance the
   Trust maintains with IBT. All significant credit balances used to reduce the
   Trust's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of total expenses in the
   Statement of Operations.

 J Interim Financial Statements -- The interim financial statements relating to
   May 31, 2003 and for the six months then ended have not been audited by
   independent certified public accountants, but in the opinion of the Trust's
   management reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
   adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements.

2 Auction Preferred Shares (APS)
- -------------------------------------------
   The Trust issued 2,620 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A and 2,620
   shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B on March 1, 1999 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded as
   a reduction of the capital of the common shares. Dividends on the APS, which
   accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering
   of the APS and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction.
   Effective July 9, 2002, a special dividend period of 364 days was set on the
   series A shares. The dividend rate, which matures on July 8, 2003, is 1.62%.
   Dividend rates ranged from 0.74% to 1.50% for Series B Shares, during the six
   months ended May 31, 2003. Series A and Series B are identical in all
   respects except for the dates of reset for the dividend rates.

   The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, at a redemption price
   equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
   dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if the Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the
   Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
   share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required to
   maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the
   Trust's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Trust pays an
   annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares' liquidation value for
   the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auctions.

3 Distributions to Shareholders
- -------------------------------------------
   The Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
   preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at the end of each
   dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction Preferred
   Shares is generally seven days. Effective July 10, 2001, the Series A shares
   set a special dividend period of 364 days. The applicable dividend rate for
   the Auction Preferred Shares on May 31, 2003 was 1.62% and 1.00%, for Series
   A and Series B Shares, respectively. For the six months ended May 31, 2003,
   the Trust paid dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to
   $544,879 and $323,843 for

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST AS OF MAY 31, 2003

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) CONT'D

   Series A and Series B Shares, respectively, representing an average APS
   dividend rate for such period of 1.62% and 1.03%, respectively.

   The Trust distinguishes between distribution on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

4 Investment Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
- -------------------------------------------
   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.70% of the
   Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM) as compensation for management and investment advisory services
   rendered to the Trust. Except for Trustees of the Trust who are not members
   of EVM's organization, officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their
   services to the Trust out of such investment adviser fee. For the six months
   ended May 31, 2003, the fee was equivalent to 0.70% of the Trust's average
   weekly gross assets and amounted to $1,236,309. EVM also serves as the
   administrator of the Trust. An administration fee, computed at the annual
   rate of 0.20% of the average weekly gross assets of the Trust, is paid to EVM
   for managing and administering business affairs of the Trust. For the six
   months ended May 31, 2003, the administrative fee amounted to $353,231.

   Trustees of the Trust that are not affiliated with EVM may elect to defer
   receipt of all or a percentage of their annual fees in accordance with the
   terms of the Trustees Deferred Compensation Plan. For the six months ended
   May 31, 2003, no significant amounts have been deferred.

   Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of EVM.

5 Investments
- -------------------------------------------
   Purchases and sales of investments, other than U.S. Government securities and
   short-term obligations, aggregated $30,379,683 and $38,959,652, respectively,
   for the six months ended May 31, 2003.

8 Financial Instruments
- -------------------------------------------
   The Trust regularly trades in financial instruments with off-balance sheet
   risk in the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing
   exposure to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures
   contracts and interest rate swaps and may involve, to a varying degree,
   elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement
   purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent
   the investment the Trust has in particular classes of financial instruments
   and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk.
   The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful
   only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

EATON VANCE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC, Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC, Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.
