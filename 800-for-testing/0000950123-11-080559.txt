1.   ORGANIZATION

     O' Connor Fund of Funds: Technology LLC (formerly UBS Technology Partners,
     L.L.C.) (the "Fund") was initially organized as a limited partnership under
     the laws of Delaware on December 28, 1998, commenced operations on April 1,
     1999 and was subsequently reorganized as a limited liability company
     effective October 15, 2002. The Fund is registered under the Investment
     Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,
     non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund's investment
     objective is to maximize capital appreciation over the long-term. The Fund
     pursues its investment objective by deploying its assets primarily among a
     select group of portfolio managers who invest primarily in, or who have
     particular knowledge within, the technology sector. Generally, such
     portfolio managers conduct their investment programs through unregistered
     investment funds (collectively, the "Investment Funds") in which the Fund
     invests as a limited partner or member along with other investors.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") have overall responsibility
     to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund, including the
     exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies regarding the
     management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.

     The Directors have engaged UBS Alternative and Quantitative Investments LLC
     ("UBS A&Q", the "Manager" and, when providing services under the
     Administration Agreement, the "Administrator"), a Delaware limited
     liability company, to provide investment advice regarding the selection of
     Investment Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the
     Fund. The Manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG and is registered
     as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
     amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Directors may determine and are generally
     accepted monthly. The Directors reserve the right to reject any application
     for interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to
     written tenders to members (the "Members"). These repurchases will be made
     at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in
     their complete and exclusive discretion. The Manager expects that
     generally, it will recommend to the Directors that the Fund offer to
     repurchase interests from Members twice each year, near mid-year and
     year-end. Members can only transfer or assign their membership interests,
     or a portion thereof, (i) by operation of law pursuant to the death,
     bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii) with the written
     approval of the Directors, which may be withheld in their sole and absolute
     discretion. Such transfers may be made even if the balance of the capital
     account to such transferee is equal to or less than the transferor's
     initial capital contribution.

2.   NEW  ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     Codification Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, Fair Value
     Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value
     Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ("ASU
     2011-04"). ASU 2011-04 requires disclosure of all transfers between Level 1
     and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those
     transfers. In addition, ASU 2011-04 expands the qualitative and
     quantitative fair value disclosure requirements for fair value measurements
     categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires a
     description of the valuation processes in place and a description of the
     sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and
     interrelationships between those inputs if a change in those inputs would
     result in a significantly different fair value measurement. ASU 2011-04 is
     effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and for
     interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the ASU 2011-04
     is currently being assessed but is not expected to have a material impact
     on the Fund's financial statements.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The Fund values its investments at fair value, in accordance with U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which is the price that
     would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
     orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

     Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of the Fund's
     investments which are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

     LEVEL 1- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
     LEVEL 2- fair value of investments in Investment Funds with the ability to
     redeem at net asset value as of the measurement date, or within one year of
     the measurement date
     LEVEL 3- fair value of investments in Investment Funds that do not have the
     ability to redeem at net asset value within one year of the measurement
     date

     The Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at
     the end of the reporting period. All transfers into and out of Level 3 can
     be found in the Level 3 reconciliation table within the Schedule of
     Portfolio Investments.

     GAAP provides guidance in determining whether there has been a significant
     decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
     compared with normal market activity for such asset or liability (or
     similar assets or liabilities). GAAP also provides guidance on identifying
     circumstances that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or
     liability is not orderly. In its

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     consideration, the Fund must consider inputs and valuation techniques used
     for each class of assets and liabilities. Judgment is used to determine the
     appropriate classes of assets and liabilities for which disclosures about
     fair value measurements are provided. Fair value measurement disclosures
     for each class of assets and liabilities requires greater disaggregation
     than the Fund's line items in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and
     Members' Capital. The Fund determines the appropriate classes for those
     disclosures on the basis of the nature and risks of the assets and
     liabilities and their classification in the fair value hierarchy (i.e.,
     Levels 1, 2, and 3).

     For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
     during the period, the Fund provides quantitative disclosures about the
     fair value measurements separately for each class of assets and
     liabilities, as well as a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances
     of Level 3 assets and liabilities broken down by class.

     The following is a summary of the investment strategies and any
     restrictions on the liquidity provisions of the investments in Investment
     Funds held in the Fund as of June 30, 2011. Investment Funds with no
     current redemption restrictions may be subject to future gates, lock-up
     provisions or other restrictions, in accordance with their offering
     documents. The Fund had no unfunded capital commitments as of June 30,
     2011. Effective June 30, 2011, the Fund used the following categories to
     classify its Investment Funds.

     The Investment Funds in the equity hedged strategy generally utilize
     fundamental analysis to invest in publicly traded equities investing in
     both long and short positions seeking to capture perceived security
     mispricings. Portfolio construction is driven primarily by bottom-up
     fundamental research; top-down analysis may also be applied. Investment
     Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 30 - 90 day redemption
     notice periods and have either initial redemption dates commencing in the
     future (5 percent) or are available to be redeemed with no restrictions (95
     percent), as of the measurement date.

     A detailed depiction of each investment in the portfolio by investment
     strategy, including any additional liquidity terms and other restrictions,
     as well as a breakdown of the portfolio into the fair value measurement
     levels, can be found in the tables within the Schedule of Portfolio
     Investments.

     Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
     Manager as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal period in
     accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be
     determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the
     Directors. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are subject to the

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2011

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     operating agreements and offering memorandums, as appropriate. The Fund's
     investments in Investment Funds are carried at fair value. All valuations
     utilize financial information supplied by each Investment Fund and are net
     of management and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the
     Investment Funds' managers or pursuant to the Investment Funds' agreements.
     The Fund's valuation procedures require the Manager to consider all
     relevant information available at the time the Fund values its portfolio.
     The Manager has assessed factors including, but not limited to the
     individual Investment Funds' compliance with fair value measurements, price
     transparency and valuation procedures in place, and subscription and
     redemption activity. The Manager and/or the Directors will consider such
     information and consider whether it is appropriate, in light of all
     relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value as
     reported or whether to adjust such value. The underlying investments of
     each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as described in each
     Investment Fund's financial statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio
     Investments).

     The fair value relating to certain underlying investments of these
     Investment Funds, for which there is no ready market, has been estimated by
     the respective Investment Funds' management and is based upon available
     information in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values and does
     not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Due to
     the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated fair values may
     differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
     market for the investments existed. These differences could be material.

     It is unknown on an aggregate basis whether the Investment Funds held any
     investments whereby the Fund's proportionate share exceeded 5% of the
     Fund's net assets at June 30, 2011.

     The fair value of the Fund's assets and liabilities which qualify as
     financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented in the
     Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

     B.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

     The Fund accounts for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund
     transactions based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of the
     underlying investment at the date of redemption. Interest income and
     expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.

     C.   FUND EXPENSES

     The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not
     limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees;

3.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     C.   FUND EXPENSES (CONTINUED)

     accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's
     net asset value; costs of insurance; registration expenses; offering and
     organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related expenses;
     expenses of meetings of Directors; all costs with respect to communications
     to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Fund has reclassified $1,626,165 and $18,946,507 from accumulated net
     investment loss and accumulated net realized gain from investments in
     Investment Funds, respectively, to net capital contributions during the six
     month period ended June 30, 2011. The reclassification was to reflect, as
     an adjustment to net contributions, the amount of estimated taxable income
     or loss that have been allocated to the Fund's Members as of June 30, 2011
     and had no effect on members' capital.

     The Fund files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
     applicable states. Management has analyzed the Fund's tax positions taken
     on its federal and state income tax returns for all open tax years, and has
     concluded that no provision for federal or state income tax is required in
     the Fund's financial statements. The Fund's federal and state income tax
     returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have
     not expired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and
     state departments of revenue. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties,
     if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the
     Statement of Operations. For the six month period ended June 30, 2011, the
     Fund did not incur any interest or penalties.

     Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return its
     distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies held in custodial accounts. The
     Fund has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe
     it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.

     F.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
     management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
     amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of

     and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in members' capital
     from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
     from those estimates.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     UBS A&Q provides certain management and administrative services to the
     Fund, including, among other things, providing office space and other
     support services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays UBS A&Q
     a monthly management fee (the "Management Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of
     the Fund's members' capital, excluding the capital account attributable to
     the Manager. The Management Fee is paid to UBS A&Q out of the Fund's assets
     and debited against the Members' capital accounts, excluding the Manager's
     capital account. A portion of the Management Fee is paid by UBS A&Q to its
     affiliates.

     UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS
     Americas, Inc., acts as a placement agent for the Fund, without special
     compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated with its
     activities as placement agent. Placement fees, if any, charged on
     contributions are debited against the contribution amounts, to arrive at a
     net subscription amount. The placement fee does not constitute assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase or decrease in members' capital derived from operations
     (net income or loss) is initially allocated to the capital accounts of all
     Members on a pro-rata basis, other than the Management Fee which is
     similarly allocated to all Members other than the Manager as described
     above. In accordance with the Limited Liability Company Agreement, the
     Manager is then allocated an amount based on the performance of the Fund
     (the "Performance Bonus") for the Measurement Period, as defined in the
     Confidential Memorandum (i.e., the period commencing on the admission of a
     Member to the Fund, and thereafter each period commencing on the day
     following the last Measurement Period and ending generally on the first to
     occur of (1) a fiscal year-end or (2) a whole or partial redemption). The
     Performance Bonus is calculated separately with respect to each Member.

     The Performance Bonus is equal to 1% of the balance of the Member's capital
     account at the end of the Measurement Period, provided that appreciation in
     the Member's capital account (net of any Performance Bonus) exceeds the
     Member's threshold return. The threshold return is the amount that a Member
     would have earned for a fiscal year if it had received an annualized rate
     of return of 20% on its opening capital account balance, as adjusted. No
     Performance Bonus was earned for the six month ended June 30, 2011 or for
     the year ended December 31, 2010.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     Each Director of the Fund receives an annual retainer of $8,250 plus a fee
     for each meeting attended. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the
     Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors each receive an
     additional annual retainer in the amount of $20,000. These additional
     annual retainer amounts are paid for by the Fund on a pro-rata basis with
     ten other UBS funds where UBS A&Q is the investment adviser. All Directors
     are reimbursed by the Fund for all reasonable out of pocket expenses.

     Other investment partnerships sponsored by UBS AG or its affiliates may
     also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

5.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODY FEES

     PFPC Trust Company (the "Custodian"), which was renamed BNY Mellon
     Investment Servicing Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, provides
     custodial services for the Fund. The Custodian entered into a service
     agreement whereby The Bank of New York Mellon provides securities clearance
     functions, as needed.

     BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNY Mellon") serves
     as accounting and investor servicing agent to the Fund and
     in that capacity provides certain administrative, accounting, record
     keeping, tax and Member related services. BNY Mellon receives a monthly fee
     primarily based upon (i) the average members' capital of the Fund subject
     to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii) the aggregate members' capital of the
     Fund and certain other investment funds sponsored or advised by UBS AG,
     UBS Americas, Inc. or their affiliates. Additionally, the Fund reimburses
     certain out of pocket expenses incurred by BNY Mellon.

     Effective March 26, 2010, the Custodian and BNY Mellon have agreed to a fee
     reduction for reimbursement of the Fund's line of credit commitment fees
     ("Fee Reduction") for a period of 364 days from November 1, 2010, the
     effective date of the Fund's line of credit agreement with State Street
     Bank and Trust Company ("Initial Term"). Based on the methodology within
     the agreement, the Custodian and BNY Mellon have agreed to waive $34,800
     for the Fund over the Initial Term. For the six month period ended June 30,
     2011, the Custodian and BNY Mellon waived $3,600 and $13,800, respectively,
     which is shown in aggregate as administration and custody fees waived on
     the Statement of Operations.

6.   LOAN PAYABLE

     Effective November 1, 2010, the Fund, along with other UBS sponsored funds,
     entered into a one year, $250,000,000 committed, secured revolving line of
     credit with State Street Bank and Trust

6.   LOAN PAYABLE (CONTINUED)

     Company. The Fund is limited to $34,800,000 (the "Borrower Sublimit
     Amount") of the secured revolving line of credit with a maximum borrowing
     limit of 15% of the Fund's Members' Capital. The interest rate on the
     borrowing is the higher of (a) 1.50% above the Overnight LIBOR Rate and (b)
     1.50% above the Federal Funds Rate, in each case as in effect from time to
     time. There is a commitment fee payable by the Fund, calculated at 25 basis
     points per annum of the Borrower Sublimit Amount not utilized.

     For the six month period ended June 30, 2011, the Fund's average interest
     rate paid on borrowings was 1.63% per annum and the average borrowings
     outstanding was $1,044,199. The Fund did not have any borrowings
     outstanding at June 30, 2011. Interest expense for the six month period
     ended June 30, 2011 was $8,544, of which $8,544 was payable at June 30,
     2011.

7.   INVESTMENTS

     As of June 30, 2011, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none of
     which were related parties.

     Aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of investments for the six
     month period ended June 30, 2011 amounted to $42,000,000 and $42,547,859,
     respectively.

     The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment Funds.
     The allocated taxable income is reported to the Fund by the Investment
     Funds on Schedule K-1. The tax basis of investments for 2011 will not be
     finalized by the Fund until after the fiscal year end.

     The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for
     compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management
     fees of 1.00% to 2.00% (per annum) of net assets and performance incentive
     fees or allocations ranging from 20.00% to 25.00% of net profits earned.
     Detailed information about the Investment Funds' portfolios is not
     available.

8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
     invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
     investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
     not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
     contracts for differences, and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in
     these Investment Funds is limited to the fair value of these investments.

9.   INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Fund.

     of such an event is remote.

The  following is a summary of the inputs used in valuing the Fund's investments
at fair value. The inputs or methodology used for valuing the Fund's investments
are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
investments.  The Fund's valuation procedures require evaluation of all relevant
factors  available  at  the  time  the Fund values its portfolio. These relevant
factors  include  the  individual  Investment  Funds' compliance with fair value
measurements,  price  transparency  and  valuation  procedures  in  place,  and
subscription  and  redemption  activity.

The Fund's investments are categorized in three levels as disclosed below. Level
1  discloses the amount of investments where the values of those investments are
based  upon  quoted  prices  in active markets for identical securities. Level 2
discloses  the amount of investments where the Fund has the ability to redeem at
net  asset value as of the June 30, 2011 measurement date, or within one year of
the measurement date. Level 3 discloses the amount of investments where the Fund
does  not  have  the ability to redeem at net asset value within one year of the
June  30,  2011  measurement  date.  There were no transfers between Level 1 and
Level  2  at  June  30,  2011.
