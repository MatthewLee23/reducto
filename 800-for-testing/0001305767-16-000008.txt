President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

The first half of 2016 has featured some remarkable twists and turns in the
global economy. The year began on shaky footing as surging market volatility
brought about by fears of weaker global economic growth as well as falling oil
prices depressed returns for investors. In the US, both equity and fixed-income
markets declined significantly through the first six weeks of the year, only to
recover the losses by the end of the first quarter when market sentiment
shifted, due in part to accommodative monetary policies from the world's central
banks.

Midway through the first quarter, for example, the US Federal Reserve System
(the Fed) backed off plans to raise interest rates four times in 2016, and the
European Central Bank announced a more comprehensive asset-purchasing program in
the hopes of encouraging lending, and boosting both inflation and economic
growth. The markets responded with a solid rally. By the end of May, in fact, US
equities, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, had generated a solid
year-to-date (YTD) return of 3.55%, and the YTD return (as of 5/31/16) of the
Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, a common measure of the US fixed-income market,
was 3.45%.

As markets began to settle down, the Brexit vote - the vote confirming that the
United Kingdom (UK) would exit the European Union (EU) - surprised many, and the
rollercoaster ride began once again. The market sold off sharply in the first
few days after the vote, then rallied as investors sought bargains created by
the initial post-Brexit sell-off, and as more, less ominous information about
the implications of the Brexit results came to light.

From a macroeconomic perspective, Pioneer believes the negative economic impact
of Brexit on the US should be more limited compared with its effects on the UK
and Europe. However, we expect reduced global demand due to a higher level of
uncertainty and risk aversion among investors. While the spillover effects on
the US economy are unclear, we think it possible that, in the event of a
significant negative economic impact, the Fed might consider other monetary
policy options. Globally, we believe that central banks are ready to act and
that their initial focus will be to stabilize the markets and provide liquidity,
if needed.

While the Brexit vote is now official, the expectation is that the actual
process of separating the UK from the EU could take at least two years. Only in
the next several months may we begin to see signs of what path Europe will
follow as it adapts to the reality of an EU without one of its most prominent
members. Over the medium-term, however, we believe uncertainties over the future
of Europe and central banks' reactions will likely dominate financial markets,
and we believe the news flow surrounding Brexit will continue to weigh on
riskier assets. Competing for headlines, too, is the current financial condition
of many European banks. Ultimately, we think that the political and monetary
policy responses will be the major variables when it comes to managing an
orderly

Brexit. In addition, as the second half of 2016 gets underway, we continue to
see central bank policies as generally supportive of the US economy -- for which
we maintain an expectation of modest growth this year.

Aside from the Brexit-caused uncertainties, economies around the world in both
developed and emerging markets are experiencing deep structural changes. Current
challenges include incomplete debt deleveraging in both emerging and developed
markets, where debt levels continue to grow, the transition of many emerging
markets economies from export/investment-driven models to more domestic
demand-driven models, and aging populations, which are reducing productivity and
limiting economic growth potential (primarily in the developed markets but also
in emerging markets such as China). Geopolitical instability on many fronts, the
rising risk of policy mistakes, and market liquidity issues combine to increase
the possibility of sharp swings in asset values. Meanwhile, in the US, as always
in a presidential election year, the political rhetoric of 2016 has the
potential to impact domestic sectors such as health care.

Throughout Pioneer's history, we have believed in the importance of active
management. During periods of market volatility, we view the value of active
management as even more compelling. Our experienced and tenured investment teams
focus on identifying value across global markets using proprietary research,
careful risk management, and a long-term perspective. We believe our shareowners
can benefit from the experience and tenure of our investment teams as well as
the insights generated from our extensive research process.

As always, and particularly during times of market uncertainty, we encourage you
to work with your financial advisor to develop an overall investment plan that
addresses both your short- and long-term goals, and to implement such a plan in
a disciplined manner.

We greatly appreciate the trust you have placed in us and look forward to
continuing to serve you in the future.

Sincerely,

/s/ Lisa M. Jones

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/16

Floating-rate bank loan investments rallied over the latter half of the
six-month period ended May 31, 2016, which resulted in the asset class producing
healthy, positive returns for the full six months. In the following interview,
Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that affected the performance of Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust during the six-month period. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice
president and a portfolio manager at Pioneer, is responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Trust.

Q    How did the Trust perform during the six-month period ended May 31, 2016?

A    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 3.60% at net asset value and 6.59% at
     market price during the six-month period ended May 31, 2016, while the
     Trust's benchmark, the Barclays US High Yield Loans Index (the Barclays
     Index), returned 3.81% at net asset value. Unlike the Trust, the Barclays
     Index does not use leverage. While the use of leverage increases investment
     opportunity, it also increases investment risk. During the same six-month
     period, the average return (at market price) of the 22 closed end funds in
     Lipper's Loan Participation Funds category (which may or may not be
     leveraged) was 7.60%.

     The shares of the Trust were selling at a 9.41% discount to net asset value
     on May 31, 2016.

     The Trust's standard, 30-day SEC yield was 5.37% at the end of the six-
     month period on May 31, 2016*.

Q    How would you describe the investment environment for bank loans during the
     six-month period ended May 31, 2016?

A    It was a difficult market for floating-rate bank loans - as well as for
     credit-sensitive investments in general - over the first half of the
     six-month period. The challenging environment that predominated for most of
     2015 persisted, an environment in which credit-sensitive investments had
     fallen into disfavor amid growing investor worries about the health of the
     world economy. Several factors drove the downturn in the prices of credit-
     sensitive securities, including falling prices of oil and other basic
     commodities, evidence of slowing economic growth in China, and a resurgent
     debt crisis in Greece that raised concerns about the prospects for the
     wider European economy.

     Given that backdrop, floating-rate loans, as measured by the Barclays
     Index, posted negative total returns over the first half of the six-month
     period (from December 2015 through February 2016). In March, however, loan

     Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

     prices bounced back sharply as oil prices stabilized and began to rise,
     with the recovery continuing over the following two months. News that the
     Chinese government's fiscal policies were becoming more accommodative in
     the hopes of spurring economic growth also buoyed the loan market, as did
     the more dovish stance adopted by the US Federal Reserve System (the Fed) -
     at least for the short term - with regard to further tightening of domestic
     monetary policy. The Fed began its tightening cycle by raising the Federal
     funds rate by 0.25% in December of 2015, but then indicated a more cautious
     approach as the global economy and the capital markets got off to a rocky
     start in early 2016.

     After losing ground in the first half of the period, the Trust's benchmark,
     the Barclays Index, generated a 6.12% return over the final three months,
     and finished the six months with a return of 3.81%.

Q    Which of your investment decisions had the biggest effects on the Trust's
     benchmark-relative performance during the six-month period ended May 31,
     2016?

A    Consistent with our traditional approach of favoring a somewhat higher-
     quality portfolio in comparison with the makeup of the Barclays Index, the
     Trust's return at net asset value outperformed the benchmark during the
     market decline from December through February, but slightly lagged the
     benchmark's return during the rally in the second half of the period. Over
     the first five months of 2016, single B-rated loans in the Barclays Index
     have returned almost 1.25% more than those rated BB, while credits rated
     CCC have returned roughly 6.25% more than BBs. These figures underscore how
     lower-quality "risk-on" assets have outperformed the rest of the loan
     market of late, a factor that detracted from the Trust's benchmark-relative
     performance in the second half of the six-month period.

     The biggest positive contributors to the Trust's absolute performance
     during the period were holdings in consumer cyclicals and consumer
     non-cyclicals. On the other hand, holdings in the insurance and energy
     sectors detracted from the Trust's returns. Energy loans benefited from
     increases in oil prices only toward the end of the period, thus limiting
     the positive offset to energy's poor performance earlier in the period.

     In comparison with the Barclays Index, the Trust's modest overweights to
     the industrials and basic industries sectors, and a moderate overweight to
     capital goods made the largest positive contributions to benchmark-
     relative performance during the six-month period. Security selection drove
     the Trust's better benchmark-relative performance in the industrials and
     basic industries sectors, while sector allocation/weighting drove stronger
     relative performance in capital goods.

                     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16 5
<PAGE>

     The biggest detractors from the Trust's benchmark-relative performance
     during the period were moderate underweights to technology, consumer
     cyclicals, and communications (broadcasting, papers, cable, telecom). In
     addition to the underweight allocations, security selection results also
     detracted from the Trust's benchmark-relative performance in both consumer
     cyclicals and communications.

     In other asset classes, the Trust's performance was helped by the
     portfolio's allocations to high-yield corporate bonds, equities, and
     event-linked bonds issued by property casualty insurers (each asset class
     representing less than 2% of the Trust's total Investment portfolio).

     Individual positions in the portfolio that detracted from the Trust's
     benchmark-relative performance during the period included loans to energy
     corporations EP Energy, a gas company that has felt the effects of low
     natural gas prices, and Dixie Electric, which provides electrical services
     to oil-drilling rigs. Other underperformers that detracted from
     benchmark-relative results included loans to Endemol, a producer of reality
     television shows, and to managed-care health insurer Medical Card Systems.

     Individual positions that aided the Trust's benchmark-relative returns
     during the six-month period included loans to Securus, a telephone company
     specializing in service to prisons and other correctional facilities; to
     Fortescue, an iron-ore mining corporation; to Jonah Energy, an oil and gas
     production company; and to Laureate, a for-profit higher-education
     corporation.

Q    How did the level of leverage in the Trust change over the six-month period
     ended May 31, 2016?

A    The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. (See Note 7
     to the financial statements).

     At the end of the 6-month period on May 31, 2016, 32.0% of the Trust's
     total managed assets were financed by leverage (or borrowed funds),
     compared with 33.1% of the Trust's total managed assets financed by
     leverage at the start of the period on December 1, 2015. During the 6-month
     period, the Trust reduced the borrowing from the credit facility by a total
     of $7 million to $143 million as of May 31, 2016. Due to the overall
     decline in prices of bank loans during the period, a reduction in the
     overall borrowing on the credit line was necessary in order to maintain the
     asset coverage requirements specified by the credit agreement. The
     percentage of the Trust's managed assets financed by leverage decreased
     during the period due to the reduction of borrowings.

<PAGE>

Q    Did the Trust invest in any derivative securities during the six-month
     period ended May 31, 2016? If so, did those investments have an effect on
     performance?

A    Yes, the Trust had a small exposure to Markit CDX (a high-yield credit-
     default-swap index) during the period. We made the investment to increase
     portfolio liquidity, and the position did not have a material impact on the
     Trust's benchmark-relative performance.

Q    What factors affected the Trust's distributions to shareholders during the
     six-month period ended May 31, 2016?

A    The Trust's distributions remained stable during the six-month period.
     Shareholders should be aware, however, that the Trust's distributions could
     be negatively affected as older loans with higher yields are called back by
     issuers and subsequently refinanced by loans with lower yields. In
     addition, the Trust drew on accumulated net investment income in paying its
     dividend during the period, but these reserves will be depleted over time.

Q    What is your investment outlook?

A    As the second half of the Trust's fiscal year began in early June,
     investors keenly awaited two events likely to have an effect on the overall
     bond market: the referendum vote on "Brexit," to determine whether the UK
     should leave the European Union, and the Fed's next move with regard to
     interest rates. The subsequent vote in support of Brexit that occurred
     after period end has added volatility to the market, although we do not
     expect it to have a major, longer-term effect on the domestic bank-loan
     market. In early June, the Fed put off any immediate tightening of monetary
     policy in the US when it left the Federal funds rate unchanged in the wake
     of a disappointing May jobs report. In that report, the US Department of
     Labor reported that monthly non-farm payrolls had increased by just 38,000
     in May, a stark difference from the 160,000 increase anticipated by the
     markets.

     It appears the current market consensus is that the Fed will likely act
     cautiously, perhaps raising rates only once or twice during the remainder
     of 2016, with any actions to tighten monetary policy based on the US
     central bank's assessment of the strength of the domestic economy.

     Despite getting off to a slow start in the first quarter, during which
     gross domestic product (GDP) growth fell short of 1%, we still believe US
     GDP should be able to grow at a moderate pace of 2.00% to 2.25% in 2016.
     Poor sales figures and a slowdown in capital spending - both tied to
     weakness in the energy markets - played a role in the disappointing GDP
     numbers in the first quarter; however, we still see persuasive evidence
     that the domestic economy is strengthening. Even after the sluggish
     employment numbers for May, new-job creation continues and employment
     growth has been solid overall. (May's job numbers were eventually revised
     even lower, to 11,000,

                     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16 7
<PAGE>

     but the picture was much rosier in June, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics
     reported that non-farm payrolls increased by a seasonally adjusted 287,000
     for the month.) Meanwhile, household formation and new-home construction
     figures have been encouraging, and we are beginning to see early signs of
     wage inflation.

     While interest-rate hikes tend to be a problem for fixed-rate securities in
     general, they can actually lead to improved performance for floating-rate
     securities, as their rates can reset upward. In addition, floating-rate
     loans, at current prices, have the potential for price appreciation.
     Currently, about two-thirds of all floating-rate loans are priced either at
     discounts to par (face) value, or at par value. We believe the prices of
     these securities have the opportunity to move higher, especially given the
     shortage of new-loan supply in today's market.

     Going forward, we will continue to monitor carefully the factors that can
     affect the performance of floating-rate investments, including supply and
     demand, the strength of the economy, and the interest-rate outlook. We
     continue to believe floating-rate loans, at current prices, offer
     attractive investment value, especially when compared with more traditional
     income-oriented investment alternatives, such as bond funds, which are
     more vulnerable to price pressures in a rising-rate environment.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 13-41 for a full listing of
Trust securities.

All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal.
In the past several years, financial markets have experienced increased
volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity, and heightened
uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen, or spread.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency
exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to attempt
to increase the Trust's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be considered
speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. Using derivatives can
increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when the market prices,
interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves behave in a way not
anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can increase price
fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested in
floating-rate senior loans and other securities which may be less liquid or
illiquid. Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of
their value at times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the
market price of illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of more
liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and investment
of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to
take advantage of market opportunities.

<PAGE>

The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage creates
significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or capital
appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage will not
be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the
return for shareowners.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment
portfolio or take other actions at what might be inopportune times in the
market. Such actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners
over time, which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the
Trust's shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to greater-than-
average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in default
or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Any information in this shareholder report regarding market or economic trends
or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of opinion as of the date of this report. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results.

     The Trust has accumulated undistributed net investment income which is part
     of the Trust's NAV. A portion of this accumulated net investment income was
     distributed to shareowners during the period. A decrease in distributions
     may have a negative effect on the market value of the Trust's shares.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit us.pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered.
There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds
are bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently
trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per share is total assets less total
liabilities, which include preferred shares, or borrowings, as applicable,
divided by the number of shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends are
assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained through open-market purchases under
the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and,
unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. The
indices do not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

Notes to Financial Statements | 5/31/16 (unaudited)

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the Trust) was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The investment
objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income and the
Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the
extent consistent with its investment objective of high current income.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements:

A.   Security Valuation

     The net asset value of the Trust is computed once daily, on each day the
     New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open, as of the close of regular trading
     on the NYSE.

     Fixed income securities are valued by using prices supplied by independent
     pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices, market
     events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
     maturities and ratings, or may use a pricing matrix or other fair value
     methods or techniques to provide an estimated value of the security or
     instrument. A pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on the
     basis of current market prices for other debt securities, historical
     trading patterns in the market for fixed income securities and/or other
     factors. Valuations may be supplemented by dealers and other sources, as
     required. Non-U.S. debt securities that are listed on an exchange will be
     valued at the bid price obtained from an independent third party pricing
     service.

     Loan interests are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the
     Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked
     prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing

48 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16
<PAGE>

     Corporation, an independent third party pricing service. If price
     information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation, or if the price
     information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be obtained
     from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable price
     quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing
     service, broker quotes will be solicited.

     Event-linked bonds or catastrophe bonds are valued at the bid price
     obtained from an independent third party pricing service. Other insurance
     linked securities (including sidecars, collateralized reinsurance and
     industry loss warranties) may be valued at the bid price obtained from an
     independent pricing service, or through a third party using a pricing
     matrix, insurance industry valuation models, or other fair value methods or
     techniques to provide an estimated value of the instrument.

     Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are valued by using the
     last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Equity
     securities that have not traded on the date of valuation, or securities for
     which sale prices are not available, generally are valued using the mean
     between the last bid and asked prices or, if both last bid and asked prices
     are not available, at the last quoted bid price. Last sale and bid and
     asked prices are provided by independent third party pricing services. In
     the case of equity securities not traded on an exchange, prices are
     typically determined by independent third party pricing services using a
     variety of techniques and methods.

     Foreign securities are valued in U.S. dollars based on foreign currency
     exchange rate quotations supplied by a third party pricing service. Trading
     in non-U.S. equity securities is substantially completed each day at
     various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of such securities
     used in computing the net asset value of the Fund's shares are determined
     as of such times. The fund may use a fair value model developed by an
     independent pricing service to value non-U.S. equity securities.

     Swap contracts, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors (other than
     centrally cleared swap contracts) are valued at the dealer quotations
     obtained from reputable International Swap Dealer association members.
     Centrally cleared swaps are valued at the daily settlement price provided
     by the central clearing counterparty.

     Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are valued daily using the
     foreign exchange rate or, for longer term forward contract positions, the
     spot currency rate, in each case provided by a third party pricing service.
     Contracts whose forward settlement date falls between two quoted days are
     valued by interpolation.

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16 49
<PAGE>

     Shares of open-end registered investment companies (including money market
     mutual funds) are valued at such funds' net asset value. Repurchase
     agreements are valued at par. Cash may include overnight time deposits at
     approved financial institutions.

     Securities or loan interests for which independent pricing services are
     unable to supply prices or for which market prices and/or quotations are
     not readily available or are considered to be unreliable are valued by a
     fair valuation team comprised of certain personnel of Pioneer Investment
     Management, Inc. (PIM), the Trust's investment adviser, pursuant to
     procedures adopted by the Trust's Board of Trustees. PIM's fair valuation
     team uses fair value methods approved by the Valuation Committee of the
     Board of Trustees. PIM's fair valuation team is responsible for monitoring
     developments that may impact fair valued securities and for discussing and
     assessing fair values on an ongoing basis, and at least quarterly, with the
     Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees.

     Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may
     include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
     market conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value
     methods if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after the
     close of the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior to
     the determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a significant
     event might include political or economic news, corporate restructurings,
     natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts. Thus, the valuation
     of the Trust's securities may differ significantly from exchange prices and
     such differences could be material.

     At May 31, 2016, four securities were valued using fair value methods (in
     addition to securities valued using prices supplied by independent pricing
     services or broker-dealers) representing 0.5% of net assets. The value of
     these fair valued securities are $1,416,850.

B.   Investment Income and Transactions

     Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
     dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
     passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
     date in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Interest income, including
     interest on income bearing cash accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis,
     net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at the applicable country
     rates.

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16
<PAGE>

     Discounts and premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted
     or amortized, respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective
     yield to maturity basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the
     cost basis of the security. Premiums and discounts related to certain
     mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the
     monthly paydowns.

     Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Gains and losses on
     sales of investments are calculated on the identified cost method for both
     financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.   Foreign Currency Translation

     The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
     denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
     current exchange rates.

     Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
     represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
     currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
     between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually
     received. Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange
     rates on investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from
     the effects of changes in the market price of those securities but are
     included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

D.   Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

     The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
     the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
     future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
     exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation
     are recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records
     realized gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by entry into a
     closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may
     arise upon entering into these contracts from the potential inability of
     counterparties to meet the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated
     movements in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

E.   Federal Income Taxes

     It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
     all of its net taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to
     its shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. As
     of November 30, 2015, the Trust did not accrue any interest or penalties
     with respect to uncertain tax positions, which if applicable, would be
     recorded as

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16 51
<PAGE>

     an income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. Tax returns filed
     within the prior three years remain subject to examination by federal and
     state tax authorities.

     The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
     shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
     which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
     Distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains are
     temporary overdistributions for financial statement and tax purposes.
     Capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent
     book/tax differences to reflect tax character, but are not adjusted for
     temporary differences.

     The tax character of current year distributions payable to shareholders
     will be determined at the end of the current taxable year.

     The tax character of distributions paid to shareowners during the year
     ended November 30, 2015 was as follows:

     ===========================================================================
</TABLE>

     The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
     primarily attributable to the realization for tax purposes of unrealized
     gains on investments in passive foreign investment companies, the book/tax
     differences in the accrual of income on securities in default, the
     difference between book and tax amortization methods and discounts on fixed
     income securities and book/tax temporary differences.

F.   Insurance Linked Securities (ILS)

     The Trust invests in event-linked bonds. Event-linked bonds are floating
     rate debt obligations for which the return of principal and the payment of
     interest are contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger"
     event, such

52 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16
<PAGE>

     as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. The trigger
     event's magnitude may be based on losses to a company or industry, industry
     indexes or readings of scientific instruments, or may be based on specified
     actual losses. If a trigger event, as defined within the terms of an
     event-linked bond occurs, the Trust may lose a portion or all of its
     accrued interest and/or principal invested in such event-linked bond. The
     Trust is entitled to receive principal and interest payments so long as no
     trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude specified by the
     instrument. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked bonds
     may expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
     (credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
     adverse tax consequences.

     The Trust's investments in ILS may include special purpose vehicles
     ("SPVs") or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a
     reinsurer's catastrophe-oriented business, known as quota share instruments
     (sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars), or to provide reinsurance
     relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a
     collateralized instrument, known as collateralized reinsurance. Structured
     reinsurance investments also may include industry loss warranties ("ILWs").
     A traditional ILW takes the form of a bilateral reinsurance contract, but
     there are also products that take the form of derivatives, collateralized
     structures, or exchange traded instruments.

     Structured reinsurance investments, including quota share instruments,
     collateralized reinsurance investments and ILWs, generally are subject to
     the same risks as event-linked bonds. In addition, where the instruments
     are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance contracts, the Trust
     has limited transparency into the individual underlying contracts and
     therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and sound underwriting
     practices of the issuer. Accordingly, it may be more difficult for PIM to
     fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of the Trust's structured
     reinsurance investments and therefore the Trust's assets are placed at
     greater risk of loss than if PIM had more complete information. Structured
     reinsurance instruments generally will be considered illiquid securities by
     the Trust. These securities may be difficult to purchase, sell or unwind.
     Illiquid securities also may be difficult to value. If the Trust is forced
     to sell an illiquid asset, the Trust may be forced to sell at a loss.

G.   Risks

     Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the
     Trust's original offering prospectus, with additional information included
     in the Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to
     those documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the
     Trust's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are
     interrelated

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16 53
<PAGE>

     or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any economic,
     political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those
     industries and sectors.

     The Trust invests in below investment grade (high yield) debt securities,
     floating rate loans and event-linked bonds sometimes referred to as
     "catastrophe" bonds or "insurance-linked" bonds. The Trust may invest in
     securities and other obligations of any credit quality, including those
     that are rated below investment grade, or are unrated but are determined by
     the investment adviser to be of equivalent credit quality. Below investment
     grade securities are commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are
     considered speculative with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay
     interest and repay principal. Below investment grade securities, including
     floating rate loans, involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater
     price volatility, and are less liquid and more difficult to value,
     especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than higher
     rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
     are in default or that are in bankruptcy. The value of collateral, if any,
     securing a floating rate loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet
     the issuer's obligations or may be difficult to liquidate. No active
     trading market may exist for many floating rate loans, and many loans are
     subject to restrictions on resale. Any secondary market may be subject to
     irregular trading activity and extended settlement periods. The Trust's
     investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited developing
     markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a
     developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
     conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
     currency exchange restrictions.

     The value of securities held by the fund may go up or down, sometimes
     rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real or
     perceived adverse economic, political or regulatory conditions, inflation,
     changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond markets or adverse
     investor sentiment. In the past several years, financial markets have
     experienced increased volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity
     and heightened uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen or
     spread.

H.   Repurchase Agreements

     Repurchase agreements are arrangements under which the Trust purchases
     securities from a broker-dealer or a bank, called the counterparty, upon
     the agreement of the counterparty to repurchase the securities from the
     Trust at a later date, and at a specific price, which is typically higher
     than the purchase price paid by the Trust. The securities purchased serve
     as the Trust's collateral for the obligation of the counterparty to
     repurchase the securities. The value of the collateral, including accrued
     interest, is required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price.
     The collateral for all repurchase agreements is

54 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16
<PAGE>

     held in safekeeping in the customer-only account of the Trust's custodian
     or a subcustodian of the Trust. The Trust's investment adviser, PIM is
     responsible for determining that the value of the collateral remains at
     least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of a default by the
     counterparty, the Trust is entitled to sell the securities, but the Trust
     may not be able to sell them for the price at which they were purchased,
     thus causing a loss to the Trust. Additionally, if the counterparty becomes
     insolvent, there is some risk that the Trust will not have a right to the
     securities, or the immediate right to sell the securities.

I.   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

     All shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
     automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
     Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
     distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional shares of
     the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
     Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
     capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely
     voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by
     notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for
     shareowners in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to
     any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be
     effective with respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other
     distribution.

     If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
     other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
     the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
     the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A
     firm or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in shares of the
     Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

     Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on shares payable in cash,
     participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares acquired by
     the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
     authorized shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares
     on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for
     any dividend, the net asset value per share is equal to or less than the
     market price per share plus estimated brokerage trading fees (market
     premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
     shares. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to each account
     will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net
     asset value per share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the
     maximum discount from the then current market price per share on the date
     of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend,
     the net asset value per share is greater

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16 55
<PAGE>

     than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent will invest the
     dividend amount in shares acquired in open-market purchases. There are no
     brokerage charges with respect to newly issued shares. However, each
     participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
     with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in
     the Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local
     taxes which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners
     holding Plan shares in a brokerage account may be able to transfer the
     shares to another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

J.   Credit Default Swap Agreements

     A credit default swap is a contract between a buyer of protection and a
     seller of protection against a pre-defined credit event on an underlying
     reference obligation, which may be a single security or a basket or index
     of securities. The Trust may buy or sell credit default swap contracts to
     seek to increase the Trust's income, or to attempt to hedge the risk of
     default on portfolio securities. A credit default swap index is used to
     hedge risk or take a position on a basket of credit entities or indices. As
     a seller of protection, the Trust would be required to pay the notional (or
     other agreed-upon) value of the referenced debt obligation to the
     counterparty in the event of a default by a U.S. or foreign corporate
     issuer of a debt obligation, which would likely result in a loss to the
     Trust. In return, the Trust would receive from the counterparty a periodic
     stream of payments during the term of the contract provided that no event
     of default occurred. The maximum exposure of loss to the seller would be
     the notional value of the credit default swaps outstanding. If no default
     occurs, the Trust would keep the stream of payments and would have no
     payment obligation. The Trust may also buy credit default swap contracts in
     order to hedge against the risk of default of debt securities, in which
     case the Trust would function as the counterparty referenced above.

     When the Trust enters into a credit default swap contract, the protection
     buyer makes an upfront or periodic payment to the protection seller in
     exchange for the right to receive a contingent payment. An upfront payment
     made by the Trust, as the protection buyer, is recorded as an asset in the
     Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Periodic payments received or paid by
     the Trust are recorded as realized gains or losses in the Statement of
     Operations.

     Credit default swap contracts are marked-to-market daily using valuations
     supplied by independent sources and the change in value, if any, is
     recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of
     Assets and

56 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16
<PAGE>

     Liabilities. Payments received or made as a result of a credit event or
     upon termination of the contract are recognized, net of the appropriate
     amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses in the Statement
     of Operations.

     Credit default swap contracts involving the sale of protection may involve
     greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the referenced debt
     instrument directly. Credit default swap contracts are subject to general
     market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the
     Trust is a protection buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its
     investment. If the Trust is a protection seller and a credit event occurs,
     the value of the referenced debt instrument received by the Trust, together
     with the periodic payments received, may be less than the amount the Trust
     pays to the protection buyer, resulting in a loss to the Trust.

     Certain swap contracts that are cleared through a central clearinghouse are
     referred to as centrally cleared swaps. All payments made or received by
     the Fund are pursuant to a centrally cleared swap - contract with the
     central clearing party rather than the original counterparty. Upon entering
     into a centrally cleared swap contract, the Fund is required to make an
     initial margin deposit, either in cash or in securities. The daily change
     in value on open centrally cleared contracts is recorded as variation
     margin on centrally cleared swaps on the Statement of Assets and
     Liabilities.

     Open credit default swap contracts at May 31, 2016 are listed in the
     Schedule of Investments.

     The average market value of swap contracts open during the six months ended
     May 31, 2016 was $56,653.

     The amount of cash deposited with the broker as collateral at May 31, 2016,
     and is included in "Restricted cash" in the Statement of Assets and
     Liabilities, was $101,426.

2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit), manages
the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's Advisory
Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall not
include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/16 57
<PAGE>

limitation, borrowing through a credit facility or the issuance of debt
securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference
securities, and/or (iii) any other means. For the six months ended May 31, 2016,
the net management fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets,
which was equivalent to 1.04% of the Trust's average daily net assets.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At May 31, 2016,
$384,284 was payable to PIM related to management costs, administrative costs
and certain other services is included in "Due to affiliates" and
"Administration fee" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

3. Transfer Agents

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company (AST) serves as the transfer agent with
respect to the Trust's shares. The Trust pays AST an annual fee, as is agreed to
from time to time by the Trust and AST, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimbursed the transfer agent for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the transfer agent related to shareowner communications activities
such as proxy and statement mailings and outgoing calls.

4. Additional Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Trust's use of derivatives subjects it to the following risks:

Interest rate risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of interest-bearing
securities due to changes in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.

Credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer of a financial instrument to
make further principal or interest payments on an obligation or commitment that
it has to the Trust.

Foreign exchange rate risk relates to fluctuations in the value of an asset or
liability due to changes in currency exchange rates.

Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as
a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest
rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether caused by factors specific to an
individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all instruments
traded in a market or market segment.

Commodity risk relates to the risk that the value of a commodity or commodity
index will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in the commodities market
and factors specific to a particular industry or commodity.

7. Loan Agreement

Effective November 26, 2013, the Trust entered into a Credit Facility (the
Credit Agreement) with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of $160,000,000.
The Credit Agreement was established in conjunction with the redemption of all
the Trust's auction market preferred shares. Effective November 25, 2015, the
Trust extended the maturity of the Credit Agreement for a 364 day period.

At May 31, 2016, the Trust had a borrowing outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaling $143,450,000. The interest rate charged at May 31, 2016 was
1.25%. During the six months ended May 31, 2016, the average daily balance was
$145,113,043 at an average interest rate of 1.26%. With respect to the Credit
Agreement, interest expense of $924,725 is included in the Statement of
Operations.

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Asset coverage is calculated by
subtracting the Trust's total liabilities not including any bank loans and
senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such amount by the
principal amount of the borrowing outstanding.

8. Subsequent Events

A monthly dividend was declared on June 2, 2016 from undistributed and
accumulated net investment income of $0.0600 per share payable June 30, 2016, to
shareowners of record on June 15, 2016.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

During the period, there have been no material changes in the Trust's investment
objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which has not been
approved by the shareowners. During the period, there have been no changes in
the principal risk factors associated with investment in the Trust. There were
no changes in the persons who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Trust's portfolio.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its shares
in the open market.

PIM, the Trust's investment adviser, is currently an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of UniCredit. On November 11, 2015, UniCredit announced that it
signed a binding master agreement with Banco Santander and affiliates of Warburg
Pincus and General Atlantic (the "Private Equity Firms") with respect to Pioneer
Investments ("Pioneer") and Santander Asset Management ("SAM") (the
"Transaction").

The Transaction, as previously announced by UniCredit, will establish a holding
company, with the name Pioneer Investments, to be owned by UniCredit (50%) and
the Private Equity Firms (50% between them). The holding company will control
Pioneer's U.S. operations, including PIM. The holding company also will own
66.7% of Pioneer's and SAM's combined operations outside the U.S., while Banco
Santander will own directly the remaining 33.3% stake. The closing of the
Transaction is subject to certain regulatory and other approvals.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, completion of the Transaction will
cause the Trust's current investment advisory agreement with PIM to terminate.
Accordingly, the Trust's Board of Trustees will be asked to approve a new
investment advisory agreement. If approved by the Board, the Trust's new
investment advisory agreement will be submitted to the shareholders of the Trust
for their approval.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                 firm, the scope of the Audit

principal financials officers, or persons performing similar functions,
regarding the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure

270.30a-3(c))) as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report
that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph,
based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule
30a-3(b) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30(a)-3(b) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).

The registrant's principal executive officer

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

                                CODE OF ETHICS

                                      FOR

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,

   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.

   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
