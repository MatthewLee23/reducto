NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2003
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC ("Company") was organized as a Delaware Limited  Liability  Company
         on August 16,  2002.  The Company is  registered  under the  Investment
         Company  Act of 1940 (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a  closed-end,
         non-diversified  management investment company. The Company consists of
         two separate series,  Multi-Strategy Series M and Multi-Strategy Series
         G (each a "Series").  The financial  statements included herein are for
         Multi-Strategy  Series G. The  investment  objective of  Multi-Strategy
         Series  G  is  to  achieve  capital  appreciation  principally  through
         investing  in  investment   funds   ("Investment   Funds")  managed  by
         third-party  investment managers ("Investment  Managers") that employ a
         variety  of  alternative   investment   strategies.   These  investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series G can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Units  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G are  sold  to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series G from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         through  November  1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional  investment  is
         $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or "the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         assets to  various  Investment  Funds.  AMACAR  Partners,  Inc.  is the
         managing   member  of   Multi-Strategy   Series  G  and  has  delegated
         substantially all authority to oversee the management of the operations
         and assets of Multi-Strategy Series G to the Board of Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements  and offering  memorandums.  Multi-Strategy  Series G values
         these investments at fair value based on financial data supplied by the
         Investment Funds.

         A.       PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series G is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

                                        8                            (continued)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Multi-Strategy  Series G's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates  assets  generally  will charge  Multi-Strategy  Series G, as
         investor in an underlying Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some
         or  all of  the  Investment  Managers  will  receive  performance-based
         compensation in the form of an incentive fee. The  asset-based  fees of
         the Investment  Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3%
         annually of the net assets under their management and the incentive fee
         is generally expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  G can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series G's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information reasonably available at
         the time. The Investment Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging
         from monthly to annually.  Investment  Funds generally  require advance
         notice of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending
         on  the  Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny  or  delay  a
         redemption request. The underlying  investments of each Investment Fund
         are accounted for at fair value as described in each Investment  Fund's
         financial  statements.  The  Investment  Funds may  invest a portion of
         their assets in restricted  securities and other  investments  that are
         illiquid.

         Pre-paid contribution to investment funds represent investments made by
         Multi-Strategy Series G which are effective as of October 1, 2003.

         B.       FUND EXPENSES

         Multi-Strategy  Series G bears all  expenses  incurred in the course of
         its operations, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
         and  expenses  related to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
         insurance;  registration expenses; organizational expenses and expenses
         of  meetings  of the  Board of  Directors.  Offering  costs  have  been
         deferred  and are  being  amortized  over the  first  twelve  months of
         operations.

         C.       INCOME TAXES

         Multi-Strategy  Series G currently  intends to operate as a partnership
         and not as an association or publicly traded  partnership  taxable as a
         corporation for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.  Each Member will be
         required  to  report  on his,  her or its own  annual  tax  return  the
         Member's distributive share of Multi-Strategy Series G's taxable income
         or loss.

         D.       CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A. account that pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost
         plus accrued interest.

         E.       USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser
         to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
         the financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes
         that the  estimates  utilized in  preparing  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         financial  statements  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  however,  actual
         results could differ from these estimates.

     3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
         OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to  Multi-Strategy  Series G,  including,  among other things,
         providing office space and other support services. In consideration for
         such services,  Multi-Strategy  Series G will pay the Adviser a monthly
         management fee equal to 0.188% (2.25% on an annualized basis) of end of
         month  Members'  Capital.  The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to
         its affiliates.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement of Units. A placement agent, which may be affiliated with the
         Adviser, will generally be entitled to receive a fee from each investor
         in the Company whose Units the agent places. The specific amount of the
         placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent on
         the size of the  investment in a Series.  Placement  agents may also be
         reimbursed  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  certain  out-of-pocket
         expenses.

         At this time, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., an affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Citigroup,  Inc.,  serves  as  the  sole
         placement agent of the Multi-Strategy Series G Units.

         Multi-Strategy  Series G pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on an
         annualized basis) for  administration  based primarily upon average net
         assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and will reimburse  certain
         expenses.  CAI, as Administrator,  has retained PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"),  an
         independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of PNC Bank, N.A.,
         to  assist  in the  performance  of  its  administrative  duties.  PFPC
         provides certain accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services.

         Receivable  from  affiliate   represents   amounts  due  from  CAI  for
         reimbursement of organizational expenses.

         Each  Director  who is not an  "interested  person"  of  Multi-Strategy
         Series G, as defined by the 1940

         Act,  receives an annual  retainer of $10,000 plus a fee per meeting of
         the Board of  Directors of $500.  Any  Director  who is an  "interested
         person"  does not receive  any annual or other fee from  Multi-Strategy
         Series G. All Directors are reimbursed for all reasonable out of pocket
         expenses. Total amounts expensed related to Directors by Multi-Strategy
         Series G for the period April 1, 2003 through  September  30, 2003 were
         $10,452.

         PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, N.A.) serves as custodian
         of Multi-Strategy Series G's assets and provides custodial services for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G.  Fees   payable   to  the   custodian   and
         reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series G.

     4.  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         The following table lists the aggregate purchases,  proceeds from sales
         of Investment  Funds,  net unrealized  appreciation,  gross  unrealized
         appreciation,  and  gross  unrealized  depreciation  as of and  for the
         period from April 1, 2003 through  September 30, 2003. At September 30,
         2003,  the cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes  was
         substantially the same as the cost for financial reporting purposes.

         Aggregate purchases                         $35,040,000
         Aggregate proceeds from sales               $4,017,595
         Gross unrealized appreciation               $7,397,069

         Net unrealized appreciation                 $4,068,845

     5.  CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

         Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for  Units  may be
         accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized by
         the Board of  Directors  of the Company to accept or reject any initial
         and additional  subscriptions for Units in Multi-Strategy Series G. The
         Board of Directors  from time to time and in its complete and exclusive
         discretion,   may  determine  to  cause  Multi-Strategy   Series  G  to
         repurchase Units from Members pursuant to written tenders by members on
         such terms and  conditions  as it may  determine.  CAI expects  that it
         typically  will  recommend to the Board of  Directors  that the Company
         offer to  repurchase  Units from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31,
         June 30,  September  30 and  December 31 (or, if any such date is not a
         business day, on the immediately preceding business day).

         Net profits or net losses of Multi-Strategy Series G for each month-end
         will be allocated  among and credited to or debited against the capital
         accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month in  accordance
         with the Members' respective investment percentages for the month.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2003
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC ("Company") was organized as a Delaware Limited  Liability  Company
         on August 16,  2002.  The Company is  registered  under the  Investment
         Company  Act of 1940 (the  "1940  Act") as  amended,  as a  closed-end,
         non-diversified  management investment company. The Company consists of
         two separate series,  Multi-Strategy Series M and Multi-Strategy Series
         G (each a "Series").  The financial  statements included herein are for
         Multi-Strategy  Series M. The  investment  objective of  Multi-Strategy
         Series  M  is  to  achieve  capital  appreciation  principally  through
         investing  in  investment   funds   ("Investment   Funds")  managed  by
         third-party  investment managers ("Investment  Managers") that employ a
         variety  of  alternative   investment   strategies.   These  investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series M can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Units  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M are  sold  to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series M from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         through  November  1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional  investment  is
         $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI",  or the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         assets to  various  Investment  Funds.  AMACAR  Partners,  Inc.  is the
         managing   member  of   Multi-Strategy   Series  M  and  has  delegated
         substantially all authority to oversee the management of the operations
         and assets of Multi-Strategy Series M to the Board of Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements  and offering  memorandums.  Multi-Strategy  Series M values
         these investments at fair value based on financial data supplied by the
         Investment Funds.

         A.       PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series M is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

                                       8                             (continued)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) - SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



         Multi-Strategy  Series M's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates  assets  generally  will charge  Multi-Strategy  Series M, as
         investor in an underlying Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some
         or  all of  the  Investment  Managers  will  receive  performance-based
         compensation in the form of an incentive fee. The  asset-based  fees of
         the Investment  Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3%
         annually of the net assets under their management and the incentive fee
         is generally expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  M can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series M's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information reasonably available at
         the time. The Investment Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging
         from monthly to annually.  Investment  Funds generally  require advance
         notice of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending
         on  the  Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny  or  delay  a
         redemption request. The underlying  investments of each Investment Fund
         are accounted for at fair value as described in each Investment  Fund's
         financial  statements.  The  Investment  Funds may  invest a portion of
         their assets in restricted  securities and other  investments  that are
         illiquid.

         B.       FUND EXPENSES

         Multi-Strategy  Series M bears all  expenses  incurred in the course of
         its operations, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
         and  expenses  related to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
         insurance;  registration expenses; organizational expenses and expenses
         of  meetings  of the  Board of  Directors.  Offering  costs  have  been
         deferred  and are  being  amortized  over the  first  twelve  months of
         operations.

         C.       INCOME TAXES

         Multi-Strategy  Series M currently  intends to operate as a partnership
         and not as an association or publicly traded  partnership  taxable as a
         corporation for U.S.  federal income tax purposes.  Each Member will be
         required  to  report  on his,  her or its own  annual  tax  return  the
         Member's distributive share of Multi-Strategy Series M's taxable income
         or loss.

         D.       CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A.  account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at
         cost plus accrued interest.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         E.       USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity with accounting
         principles generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser
         to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
         the financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes
         that the  estimates  utilized in  preparing  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         financial  statements  are  reasonable  and  prudent;  however,  actual
         results could differ from these estimates.

     3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
         OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to  Multi-Strategy  Series M,  including,  among other things,
         providing office space and other support services. In consideration for
         such services,  Multi-Strategy  Series M will pay the Adviser a monthly
         management fee equal to 0.167% (2.00% on an annualized basis) of end of
         month  Members'  Capital.  The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to
         its affiliates.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement of Units. A placement agent, which may be affiliated with the
         Adviser, will generally be entitled to receive a fee from each investor
         in the Company whose Units the Agent places. The specific amount of the
         placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent on
         the size of the  investment in a Series.  Placement  agents may also be
         reimbursed  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  certain  out-of-pocket
         expenses.

         At this time, Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., an affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly  owned  subsidiary  of  Citigroup,  Inc.,  serves  as  the  sole
         placement agent of the Multi-Strategy Series M Units.

         Multi-Strategy  Series M pays CAI a monthly fee of 0.025%  (0.30% on an
         annualized basis) for  administration  based primarily upon average net
         assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and will reimburse  certain
         expenses.  CAI, as Administrator,  has retained PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"),  an
         independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary of PNC Bank, N.A.,
         to  assist  in the  performance  of  its  administrative  duties.  PFPC
         provides certain accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services.

         Receivable  from  affiliate   represents   amounts  due  from  CAI  for
         reimbursement of organizational expenses.

         Each  Director  who is not an  "interested  person"  of  Multi-Strategy
         Series M, as defined by the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of
         $10,000 plus a fee per meeting of the Board of  Directors of $500.  Any
         Director who is an  "interested  person" does not receive any annual or
         other fee from  Multi-Strategy  Series M. All Directors are  reimbursed
         for all  reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed
         related to Directors by Multi-Strategy Series M for the period April 1,
         2003 through September 30, 2003 were $7,596.

         discretion,   may  determine  to  cause  Multi-Strategy   Series  M  to
         repurchase Units from Members pursuant to written tenders by Members on
         such terms and  conditions  as it may  determine.  CAI expects  that it
         typically  will  recommend to the Board of  Directors  that the Company
         offer to  repurchase  Units from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31,
         June 30,  September  30 and  December 31 (or, if any such date is not a
         business day, on the immediately preceding business day).

         Net profits or net losses of Multi-Strategy Series M for each month-end
         will be allocated  among and credited to or debited against the capital
         accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month in  accordance
         with the Members' respective investment percentages for the month.

     6.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

         In the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Investment  Funds  in which
         Multi-Strategy Series M invests trade various financial instruments and
         enter into various  investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk.
         These  include,  but are not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,
         writing option contracts and entering into equity swaps.
