LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

                                                                  August 5, 2003

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

We are writing to report on the activities of The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
for the six months ended June 30, 2003.

At June 30, 2003, the Fund's net assets were $107.6 million. The Fund's net
asset value ("NAV") was $10.61 per share, compared to $8.39 on December 31,
2002.

PERFORMANCE

For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Fund's total return, based on NAV
was 26.46%. By comparison, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Chile Index*
increased 27.75%. Stocks that helped the Fund's performance included its bank,
utilities and telecommunications holdings. On the negative side, relatively
speaking, the Fund's materials and capital goods holdings lagged their
respective benchmark components.

THE MARKET: IMPROVING RAPIDLY

Over the past six months, Chile's economy and equity market materially improved,
and its prospects for future growth appeared to improve as well.

The first quarter was marred to some extent by slow global growth and the
possibility of a backlash from Chile's opposition to the U.S.-led war with Iraq,
which some feared would jeopardize a pending free trade agreement with the
United States. Even so, prices for copper and pulp, the country's primary
exports, rose. Regional tensions from economic and political problems in
neighboring Argentina and Brazil, which had negatively affected Chile's economy
over the past several quarters, also began to wane. By quarter's end, the
performance of Chile's equity market was essentially flat in U.S. dollar terms,
which was quite good considering the negative impact that rising geopolitical
risk had on most equity markets worldwide.

During the second quarter, with the relaxation of global uncertainty and renewed
investor appetite for risk following the end of the U.S.-led conflict with Iraq,
the Chilean equity market performed strongly, as did Latin America markets
generally.

Helping to drive investor interest in Chilean equities was the June signing of a
free trade agreement with the United States. If, as expected, ratification of
this agreement by both countries occurs in this year's second half, Chile will
begin to trade freely with the United States early in 2004.

An export-intensive country, Chile now has free trade agreements with both the
European Union and the United States, two major economic zones that together
represent about two-thirds of its commercial exchange. This should lead to
increasing GDP growth and significantly reduced country risk. Indeed, regarding
the latter, the yield spread between Chile's sovereign bonds and U.S. Treasury
bonds narrowed in the quarter. Also of note, inflation was close to zero,
unemployment declined and foreign accounts appeared under control. Given all
this, investors were generally optimistic that Chile's GDP could expand from its
current 3% or so annual rate.

                                        1
<Page>

The regional outlook also improved significantly. Argentina's economic woes
diminished further, with the country reporting good GDP growth and improving
trade. Brazil also pleasantly and unexpectedly surprised investors on the upside
by acting in a market-friendly manner. Thus far, it has proven fiscally
responsible by controlling spending, thereby helping to reduce Brazil's
sovereign spread and country risk.

With the ebbing of these two highly destabilizing forces, Chile's economy
improved, growing at an approximate rate of 3% during the second quarter.

Looking ahead to what we feel will be an improving economy, we began to increase
our weightings in the economically sensitive banking and consumption-related
sectors during the first quarter. We slowly increased our exposure to local
companies hit by the recent economic crises in Argentina and Brazil, while
slightly underweighting the telecommunications sector. We also stressed
companies that generate electricity, rather than those that distribute it.
Beyond this, we maintained our investments in wine exporters, whose products
continued to enjoy strong demand in the international marketplace.

During the second quarter, we were overweight those exporters that we felt would
benefit the most from free trade with the U.S. and Europe, with wine producers
again being a favorite industry group.

We intend to remain neutral to pulp producers. Even though we do not think the
price of pulp will increase in the very near term (we think pulp prices may be
near the bottom of a cycle, with potential for improvement in six months
perhaps), we are optimistic that recent capacity increases will likely enable
them to enhance revenues by selling greater quantities more efficiently in the
international marketplace.

On the economic front, lower unemployment, low interest rates, and improved
consumer confidence lead us to believe that domestic consumption might increase
over the near term. In anticipation of this, we have taken overweight positions
in market leading retailers. We are and expect to remain neutral on the banking
sector. Although any increase in consumption and GDP growth will likely
positively affect banks, we think present valuations in this sector are on the
high side.

OUTLOOK: INCREASINGLY OPTIMISTIC

Owing in large measure to the aforementioned free trade agreements, we are
optimistic about the future prospects for Chile's equity market. These
agreements, which should play well in the country's well-organized and stable
economy, could result in above average GDP growth over the next couple of years.

Increasing the attractiveness of Chile's equity market as well was the adoption
late last year of a reform to Chile's financially powerful pension system that,
for the first time, allows participants to choose how they want to invest their
money. Previously they had only one choice, that being a fund with only a 30%
domestic equity component. Now, participants can choose between five funds, with
varying equity components. Fund "A", for example, has an 80% equity allocation,
while with fund "B" it is 50%-60%, with fund "C" it is 30%, and so on down the
line. In practice, many people have elected to go with the equity-heavy funds,
thereby injecting considerable demand and associated liquidity into the
country's equity marketplace.

                                        2

Elsewhere, the price of copper and pulp (Chile's two main export products) are
presently supportive, a reflection of slowly improving global economic
conditions. The price of oil, Chile's main import, has declined since the end of
the Iraq war. As such, Chile's foreign accounts could continue to be favorable,
and we believe that a fairly stable Chilean peso vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar can
prevail over the near term.

In all, it is beginning to appear to us as if the long desired recovery in
Chile's economy and equity marketplace may be just around the corner, awaiting
only the resumption of stronger global economic growth, before kicking into high
gear.

Respectfully,

/s/ Yaroslaw Aranowicz

THE CHILE FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

NOTE A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on January 30,
1989 and commenced investment operations on September 27, 1989. The Fund is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company.

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value of the Fund is determined daily as of
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"Exchange") on each day the Exchange is open for business. The Fund's equity
investments are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the
closing price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily
traded at the time of valuation (the "Valuation Time"). If no sales are
reported, equity investments are generally valued at the most recent bid
quotation as of the Valuation Time or at the lowest ask quotation in the case of
a short sale of securities. Debt securities with a remaining maturity greater
than 60 days are valued in accordance with the price supplied by a pricing
service, which may use a matrix, formula or other objective method that takes
into consideration market indices, yield curves and other specific adjustments.
Debt obligations that will mature in 60 days or less are valued on the basis of
amortized cost, which approximates market value, unless the Board of Directors
determines that using this method would not reflect an investment's value.

Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors under procedures established by the Board of Directors in the absence
of readily ascertainable market values. At June 30, 2003, the Fund held 3.24% of
its net assets in a security valued at fair value as determined in good faith by
the Board of Directors with an aggregate cost of $4,384,163 and fair value of
$3,489,687. Although this security may be resold in privately negotiated
transactions, the prices realized on such sales could differ from the price
originally paid by the Fund or the current carrying value, and the difference
could be material.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT: The Fund sweeps available cash into a short-term deposit
issued by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Fund's custodian. The short-term
time deposit is a variable rate account classified as a short-term investment.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment transactions are
accounted for on a trade date basis. The cost of investments sold is determined
by use of the specific identification method for both financial reporting and
U.S. income tax purposes. Interest income is accrued as earned; dividend income
is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

TAXES: No provision is made for U.S. income or excise taxes as it is the Fund's
intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and to make
the requisite distributions to its shareholders which will be sufficient to
relieve it from all or substantially all U.S. income and excise taxes.

The Fund is subject to a 10% Chilean repatriation tax with respect to certain
remittances from Chile and on net unrealized gains on certain securities held in
Chilean pesos. Realized capital gains on certain liquid securities will not be
subject to the tax. Realized capital gains on illiquid securities, interest and
dividends received are subject to the remittance tax. For the six

                                       12
<Page>

months ended June 30, 2003, the Fund did not incur such expenses.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS: The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (I)  market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
          valuation date rate of exchange; and

     (II) purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at
          the relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of
          such transactions.

The Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses in investments in
equity securities which is due to changes in the foreign exchange rates from
that which is due to changes in market prices of equity securities. Accordingly,
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such
securities are included in the reported net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on investment transactions balances.

The Fund reports certain foreign currency related transactions and foreign taxes
withheld on security transactions as components of realized gains for financial
reporting purposes, whereas such foreign currency related transactions are
treated as ordinary income for U.S. income tax purposes.

Net unrealized currency gains or losses from valuing foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are reflected as
a component of net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) in value of
investments and translation of other assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currencies.

Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses represent foreign exchange gains
and losses from sales and maturities of debt securities, transactions in foreign
currencies and forward foreign currency contracts, exchange gains or losses
realized between the trade date and settlement date on security transactions,
and the difference between the amounts of interest and dividends recorded on the
Fund's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME AND GAINS: The Fund distributes at least annually to
shareholders substantially all of its net investment income and net realized
short-term capital gains, if any. The Fund determines annually whether to
distribute any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized
short-term capital losses, including capital loss carryovers, if any. An
additional distribution may be made to the extent necessary to avoid the payment
of a 4% U.S. federal excise tax. Dividends and distributions to shareholders are
recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.

The character of distributions made during the year from net investment income
or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for U.S.
income tax purposes due to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles/tax
differences in the character of income and expense recognition.

OTHER: Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject
to changes in value due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

The Chilean securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more
volatile than the major securities markets in the United States. Consequently,
acquisition and disposition of securities by the Fund may be inhibited. A
significant proportion of the aggregate market value of equity securities listed
on the Santiago Exchange are held by a small number of investors and are not
publicly traded. This may limit the number of shares available for acquisition
or disposition by the Fund.

                                       13
<Page>

Investments in Chile may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated with investments in the United States, including the possibility of
future political and economic developments and the level of Chilean governmental
supervision and regulation of its securities markets.

The Fund, subject to local investment limitations, may invest up to 20% of its
assets (at the time of commitment) in illiquid equity securities, including
securities of private equity funds (whether in corporate or partnership form)
that invest primarily in emerging markets. When investing through another
investment fund, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses
incurred by the fund, including management fees. Such securities are expected to
be illiquid, which may involve a high degree of business and financial risk and
may result in substantial losses. Because of the current absence of any liquid
trading market for these investments, the Fund may take longer to liquidate
these positions than would be the case for publicly traded securities. Although
these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions, the prices
realized on any such sales could be substantially less than those originally
paid by the Fund or the current carrying values and this difference could be
material. Further, companies whose securities are not publicly traded may not be
subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements applicable
to companies whose securities are publicly traded.

NOTE B. AGREEMENTS

annual rate of 0.08% of the first $100 million of the Fund's average weekly net
assets, 0.06% of the next $50 million of the Fund's average weekly net assets

For the six months ended June 30, 2003, the administration fees, supplemental
administration fees and accounting fees amounted to $19,695, $28,761 and $2,380,
respectively.

Merrill Corporation ("Merrill"), an affiliate of CSAM, has been engaged by the
Fund to provide certain financial printing services. For the six months ended
June 30, 2003, Merrill was paid $14,503 for its services to the Fund.

On May 8, 2000, the Fund's Board of Directors unanimously approved a proposal by
the Independent Directors to partially compensate Independent Directors in
shares of the Fund. Under this policy, such directors receive fifty percent
(50%) of their annual retainer in the form of shares purchased by the Fund's
transfer agent in the open market. Directors as a group own less than 1% of the
Fund's outstanding shares.

NOTE C. CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Fund is 100,000,000 shares of common stock,
$0.001 par value. Of the 10,139,926 shares outstanding at June 30, 2003, CSAM
owned 14,615 shares.

NOTE D. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

For the six months ended June 30, 2003, purchases and sales of securities, other
than short-term investments, were $11,432,586 and $10,690,773, respectively.

NOTE E. CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund, together with other funds/portfolios advised by CSAM (collectively,
the "Participating Funds"), participates in a $100 million committed, unsecured,
line of credit facility ("Credit Facility") with Deutsche Bank, A.G. as
administrative agent and syndication agent and State Street Bank and Trust
Company as operations agent for temporary or emergency purposes. Under the terms
of the Credit Facility, the Participating Funds pay an aggregate commitment fee
at a rate of 0.10% per annum on the average unused amount of the Credit
Facility, which is allocated among the Participating Funds in such manner as is
determined by the governing Boards of the Participating Funds. In addition, the
Participating Funds pay interest on borrowings at the Federal Funds rate plus
0.50%. During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the Fund had no borrowings
under the Credit Facility.

NOTE F. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Income and capital gains distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, losses
deferred due to wash sales and Post-October losses (as defined below), and
excise tax regulations.

The tax characteristic of dividends paid during the fiscal year ended December
31, 2002 for the Fund was $912,593 from ordinary income.

Under current tax law, certain capital losses realized after October 31 within a
taxable year may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the
following tax year ("Post-October losses"). For the tax period ended December
31, 2002, the Fund incurred and elected to defer net realized losses of $592,036
from investments.

At December 31, 2002, the Fund had a capital loss carryforward for U.S. federal
income tax purposes of $585,879 of which $349,317 expires in 2009 and $236,562
expires in 2010.

At June 30, 2003, the identified cost for federal income tax purposes, the gross
unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities having an excess
of value over cost, gross unrealized depreciation from investments for those
securities having an excess of cost over value and the net unrealized
appreciation

                                       15
<Page>

from investments were $82,807,389, $33,318,640, $(7,129,857) and $26,188,783,
respectively.

NOTE G. SELF-TENDER OFFER

On November 27, 2001, the Fund's Board of Directors approved a tender offer to
acquire up to 25% of the outstanding shares of the Fund's common stock at a per
share cash purchase price equal to 95% of the Fund's net asset value as of the
expiration date of the tender offer period. The Board's actions were taken in
light of the significant discounts at which the Fund's shares were trading.

On January 4, 2002, the Fund commenced a tender offer to acquire up to 25% of
its outstanding shares of common stock at a per share cash purchase price equal
to 95% of net asset value per share as of February 4, 2002, the day the offer
expired. Upon expiration of the offer, the Fund accepted for payment 3,379,976
shares of common stock of the Fund at a price of $9.02 per share.

CERTIFICATIONS

I, Michael A. Pignataro, certify that:

          1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of The Chile Fund,
Inc.;

          2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make
the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;

          3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other
financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets,
and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement
of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
report;

          4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible
for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant
and have:

          (a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated

during the period in which this report is being prepared;

committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
equivalent functions):

          (a)  all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to
record, process, summarize, and report financial data and have identified for
the registrant's auditors any material weakness in internal controls; and

          (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or

controls; and

<Page>

          6.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated
in this report whether or not there were significant changes in internal

actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
