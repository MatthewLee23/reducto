             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Members and Board of Managers of
Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.  (the "Company"),  including
the schedules of portfolio investments,  securities sold, not yet purchased, and
swap contracts as of December 31, 2008, and the related  statement of operations
for the year then ended,  the statements of changes in members' capital for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period  then  ended.  These  financial  statements  and
financial  highlights are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to  express  an opinion  on these  financial  statements  and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material  misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the
effectiveness  of the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.
Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
securities owned as of December 31, 2008, by  correspondence  with the custodian
and  others.  We believe  that our  audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of
Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C. at December 31, 2008, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its members' capital for each
of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended,  in conformity  with U.S.  generally
accepted accounting principles.

ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -DECEMBER 31, 2008
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      1. ORGANIZATION

         Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund,  L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized
         as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of Delaware in January
         1999.  The Company is registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"),  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified
         management  investment company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless
         the  Company is  otherwise  terminated  under the terms of the  Limited
         Liability  Company  Agreement  dated as of June 5, 2003.  The Company's
         investment  objective is to achieve  maximum capital  appreciation.  It
         pursues this objective by actively investing in a portfolio  consisting
         generally of equity securities of technology companies and of companies
         which derive a major  portion of their  revenue  directly or indirectly
         from  technological  events and advances.  The  Company's  portfolio of
         securities in the technology area is expected to include long and short
         positions   primarily  in  equity   securities  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
         companies.  Equity  securities  include common and preferred  stock and
         other securities having equity  characteristics,  including convertible
         debt securities, stock options, warrants and rights.

         Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of the
         operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
         Board of Managers of the Company (the "Board of  Managers").  There are
         six  members of the Board of  Managers,  one of whom is  considered  an
         "interested person" under the Act. The Company's  investment adviser is
         Advantage  Advisers  Management,  L.L.C., a Delaware limited  liability
         company (the  "Adviser").  The Adviser is a subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer
         Asset  Management  Inc.  ("OAM") and an affiliate of  Oppenheimer & Co.
         Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is  responsible  for  managing  the
         Company's  investment  activities  pursuant to an  investment  advisory
         agreement  dated  June  5,  2003.  OAM is the  managing  member  of the
         Adviser,   and  Alkeon  Capital  Management  L.L.C.   ("Alkeon")  is  a
         non-managing member of the Adviser.  Investment  professionals employed
         by Alkeon,  including Mr. Takis Sparaggis,  who serves as the Company's
         portfolio  manager,  manage the  Company's  portfolio  on behalf of the
         Adviser under the supervision of OAM. Oppenheimer has a minority profit
         participation interest in Alkeon.

         The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members is
         subject to  approval  by the Board of  Managers.  At a meeting  held on
         November 1, 2004,  the Board of Managers  approved  the  acceptance  of
         initial  contributions  to the  Company  from new  members  on or after
         January 1, 2005.  The Company may from time to time offer to repurchase
         interests pursuant to written tenders by Members. Such repurchases will
         be made at such  times and on such  terms as may be  determined  by the
         Board of  Managers,  in its  complete  and  exclusive  discretion.  The
         Adviser  expects  that  generally  it will  recommend  to the  Board of
         Managers that the Company offer to  repurchase  interests  from Members
         twice each year,  effective at the end of the second fiscal quarter and
         again at the end of the year.

         Generally,  except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not
         be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities in any
         amount in excess of the capital  account  balance of such Member,  plus
         such Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

      2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial  statements
         are reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from
         these estimates.

         A.  REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,  are
         recorded on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
         ex-dividend date, net of applicable  withholding taxes. Interest income
         and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and discounts
         on fixed income  securities are amortized using the effective  interest
         rate method.

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Company's  securities  are valued at fair value in accordance  with
         policies adopted by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

         (i) Domestic  exchange traded  securities (other than options and those
             securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

             (1) at  their  last  composite  sale  prices  as  reported  on  the
                 exchanges where those securities are traded; or

             (2) if no sales of those  securities  are  reported on a particular
                 day, the securities  are valued based upon their  composite bid
                 prices for  securities  held  long,  or their  composite  asked
                 prices for securities  sold, not yet purchased,  as reported by
                 those exchanges.

         (ii)Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

             (1) at the NASDAQ  Official  Closing Price  ("NOCP")  (which is the
                 last trade price at or before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) adjusted
                 up to NASDAQ's  best offer  price if the last  traded  price is
                 below such bid and down to  NASDAQ's  best  offer  price if the
                 last trade is above such offer price); or

             (2) if no NOCP is  available,  at the last sale price on the NASDAQ
                 prior to the calculation of the net asset value of the Company;
                 or

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -DECEMBER 31, 2008 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

             (3) if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

             (4) if no sale is shown  and no bid price is  available,  the price
                 will be deemed  "stale"  and the value  will be  determined  in
                 accordance with the fair valuation procedures set forth herein.

         Securities traded on a foreign securities  exchange are valued at their
         last sale prices on the exchange  where such  securities  are primarily
         traded,  or in the absence of a reported  sale on a particular  day, at
         their bid prices (in the case of securities  held long) or asked prices
         (in the case of securities sold, not yet purchased) as reported by such
         exchange.  Listed  options  are  valued at their bid  prices  (or asked
         prices  in the case of  listed  written  options)  as  reported  by the
         exchange with the highest  volume on the last day a trade was reported.
         Other securities for which market  quotations are readily available are
         valued at their bid prices (or asked  prices in the case of  securities
         sold,  not yet  purchased) as obtained from one or more dealers  making
         markets  for those  securities.  If market  quotations  are not readily
         available,  the fair  value of the  securities  and  other  assets  are
         determined in good faith by, or under the  supervision of, the Board of
         Managers.

         Foreign-denominated   assets  may  involve  more  risks  than  domestic
         transactions, including political, economic, and regulatory risk. Risks
         may also arise from the potential  inability of a counterparty  to meet
         the terms of a contract and from  unanticipated  movements in the value
         of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

         Debt securities are valued in accordance with the procedures  described
         above,  which with  respect to such  securities  may include the use of
         valuations  furnished by a pricing  service  which  employs a matrix to
         determine  valuation  for normal  institutional  size trading  units or
         consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
         Managers will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
         provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities with remaining
         maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual  circumstances,  be
         valued at amortized  cost,  so long as such  valuation is determined by
         the Board of Managers to represent fair value.

         All assets and liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
         are converted into U.S.  dollars using foreign  exchange rates provided
         by a pricing service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m. London time.  Trading in
         foreign  securities  generally  is  completed,  and the  values of such
         securities are determined,  prior to the close of securities markets in
         the U.S.  Foreign  exchange  rates  are also  determined  prior to such
         close.  On occasion,  the values of such  securities and exchange rates
         may be  affected  by events  occurring  between the time such values or
         exchange  rates are determined and the time that the net asset value of
         the  Company is  determined.  When such  events  materially  affect the
         values of  securities  held by the  Company  or its  liabilities,  such
         securities and  liabilities are fair valued as determined in good faith
         by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         The  determination  of fair value shall take into  account the relevant
         factors  and  surrounding  circumstances,  which may  include:  (i) the
         nature  and  pricing   history  (if  any)  of  the  security  or  other
         investment;  (ii) whether any dealer  quotations are  available;  (iii)
         possible  valuation  methodologies that could be used to determine fair
         value;  (iv) the  recommendation  of the  Adviser  with  respect to the
         valuation;  (v)  whether  the  same  or  similar  securities  or  other
         investments  are held by other  accounts or other funds  managed by the
         Adviser  and the  valuation  method used by the  Adviser  with  respect
         thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair value to be determined will
         result  from the use of data or  formulae  produced  by  third  parties
         independent  of the Adviser;  and (vii) the liquidity or illiquidity of
         the market for the security or other investment.

         The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify as
         financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No.  107,  "Disclosures  about  Fair Value of  Financial  Instruments,"
         approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement  ofAssets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         In September  2006,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
         issued   STATEMENT  ON  FINANCIAL   STANDARDS  NO.  157,   "FAIR  VALUE
         MEASUREMENTS" (FAS 157). This standard clarifies the definition of fair
         value for  financial  reporting,  establishes a framework for measuring
         fair value and requires  additional  disclosures  about the use of fair
         value measurements. The Company adopted FAS 157 as of January 1, 2008.

         Various  inputs  are used in  determining  the  value of the  Company's
         investments.  These  inputs are  summarized  in the three broad  levels
         listed below.

         Level 1 - observable  market inputs that are  unadjusted  quoted prices
         for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

         Level 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
         for similar  securities,  interest rates,  prepayments  speeds,  credit
         risk, etc.).

         Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Company's own
         assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

         The  inputs  or  methodology  used  for  valuing   securities  are  not
         necessarily  an indication  of the risk  associated  with  investing in
         these securities.

*    Other financial instruments are derivative instruments not reflected in the
     Schedule of  Investments,  such as futures,  forwards  and swap  contracts,
     which  are  valued  at  unrealized   appreciation   (depreciation)  on  the
     investment.

         C.  CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The Company treats all highly liquid financial  instruments that mature
         within  three  months at the time of purchase as cash  equivalents.  At
         December 31, 2008, $51,508,635 in cash equivalents was held at PNC Bank
         in a money market account.

         D.  INCOME TAXES

         The  Company  has   reclassified   $10,257,483   and  $7,854,136   from
         accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized loss on
         investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
         ended  December  31,  2008.  This  reclassification  was  a  result  of
         permanent book to tax  differences to reflect,  as an adjustment to net
         capital  contributions,  the amounts of taxable  loss and net  realized
         gain on investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members
         and had no effect on net assets.

         The  Company is  subject  to the  provisions  of  Financial  Accounting
         Standards  Board   Interpretation   48  ("FIN  48"),   "Accounting  for
         Uncertainty in Income Taxes".  This standard  defines the threshold for
         recognizing  the  benefits of  tax-return  positions  in the  financial
         statements  as  "more-likely-than-not"  to be  sustained  by the taxing
         authority  and  requires  measurement  of a tax  position  meeting  the
         more-likely-than-not  criterion,  based on the largest  benefit that is
         more than 50 percent likely to be realized. Management has analyzed the
         Company's  tax  positions  taken on Federal  income tax returns for all
         open tax years  (tax  years  ended  December  31,  2005-2008),  and has
         concluded  that a liability of  $3,845,460  capital gain country tax is
         required in the Company's financial statements.

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         D.  INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

         The Company  recognizes  interest  and  penalties,  if any,  related to
         unrecognized  tax benefits  within country tax expense in the statement
         of operations.

         Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return
         its distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services to the Company
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays Oppenheimer a
         monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of
         the Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

         During the year ended December 31, 2008,  Oppenheimer earned $85,242 as
         brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf of
         the Company.  Mainsail  Group,  L.L.C.,  a  broker-dealer  affiliate of
         Alkeon,  earned  $1,863,161  as brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio
         transactions executed on behalf of the Company.

         Net profits or net losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
         allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
         of all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of the last day
         of each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective investment
         percentages for the fiscal period. The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
         Special  Advisory  Member of the  Company,  is  entitled  to receive an
         incentive  allocation  (the  "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged  to the
         capital  account of each  Member as of the last day of each  allocation
         period,  of 20% of the amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the
         positive balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive
         Allocation is credited to the Special  Advisory Account of the Adviser.
         By the last  business day of the month  following  the date on which an
         Incentive  Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of
         the  Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited to the Special  Advisory
         Account with respect to the  allocation  period.  During the year ended
         December 31, 2008, an Incentive  Allocation of $105,712 was credited to
         the Special  Advisory  Member's  capital  account  and was  included in
         withdrawals  payable at December 31, 2008,  in the Statement of Assets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not an
         "interested  person" of the Company, as defined by the Act, receives an
         annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  The
         lead independent Manager receives an additional fee of $2,500. Managers
         who are  "interested  persons"  do not  receive any annual or other fee
         from  the  Company.  Managers  who are  not  "interested  persons"  are
         reimbursed  by the Company for all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses
         incurred by them in performing their duties.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

         PFPC  Trust  Company  (the  "Custodian")  serves  as  custodian  of the
         Company's assets.

         PNC Global Investment  Servicing Inc. ("PNC"),  formerly known as PFPC,
         Inc.,  serves as investor  services and accounting agent to the Company
         and in that capacity  provides certain  accounting,  recordkeeping  and
         investor  related  services.  The Company  pays PNC an  accounting  and
         investor  services fee based primarily on the average net assets of the
         Company as of the last day of each month, payable monthly, subject to a
         minimum annual fee.

         Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive  placement agent for the Company,
         without  special   compensation  from  the  Company,  and  bears  costs
         associated  with  its  activities  as  placement  agent.  However,  the
         placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission  of up to 3%
         (up to 3.1% of the amount  invested) in  connection  with a purchase of
         interests,  at its  discretion.  For the year ended  December 31, 2008,
         such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $218,580.

      4. INDEMNIFICATIONS

         The Company has entered into  several  contracts  that contain  routine
         indemnification  clauses.  The Company's  maximum  exposure under these
         arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve future claims that may
         be made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However, based
         on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

      5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  investment  securities,  excluding
         short-term  securities,  for the year ended December 31, 2008, amounted
         to $2,746,363,430 and $2,443,916,007, respectively. Aggregate purchases
         and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased,  excluding  short-term
         securities,   for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2008,  amounted  to
         $2,157,403,258 and $2,495,570,468, respectively.

         At  December  31,  2008,  the  aggregate  cost for  Federal  income tax
         purposes  of  portfolio   investments  and  securities  sold,  not  yet
         purchased was $782,927,946, and $433,919,218, respectively.

         For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2008,  accumulated net
         unrealized  depreciation on portfolio  investments and securities sold,
         not yet purchased was  $87,746,949,  consisting of  $100,553,866  gross
         unrealized appreciation and $188,300,815 gross unrealized depreciation.

         Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold, not
         yet  purchased,  net of excess  cash,  held at the  prime  broker as of
         December 31, 2008 and is used as collateral  for  securities  sold, not
         yet purchased.

      6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that connection,
         borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in
         equity  securities  on margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
         representing  at least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
         respect to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
         respect  to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act  requires  the
         Company  to  satisfy  an  asset  coverage  requirement  of  300% of its
         indebtedness,  including  amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the
         Company  incurs  the   indebtedness.   The  Company  pays  interest  on
         outstanding  margin  borrowings  at an  annualized  rate of LIBOR  plus
         0.875%.  The Company  pledges  securities as collateral  for the margin
         borrowings,  which are  maintained in a segregated  account held by the
         Custodian.  For the year ended  December  31, 2008,  the average  daily
         amount of such borrowings was $6,367,275 and the daily weighted average
         annualized   interest  rate  was  1.92%.  The  Company  had  borrowings
         outstanding at December 31, 2008, totaling  $22,701,815 recorded as due
         to broker on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS  OF
         CREDIT RISK

         In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
         financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with
         off-balance  sheet risk. These financial  instruments  include options,
         swaps  and  securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,  these
         financial  instruments represent future commitments to purchase or sell
         other  financial  instruments  at specific  terms at  specified  future
         dates. Each of these financial  instruments contains varying degrees of
         off-balance  sheet risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value of the
         securities underlying the financial instruments may be in excess of the
         amounts recognized in the statement of assets, liabilities and members'
         capital.

         The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts  which, at times,
         may exceed  federally  insured limits.  The Company has not experienced
         any losses in such  accounts  and does not believe it is exposed to any
         significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

         Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company
         to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a liability  to
         purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at  prevailing   prices.
         Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
         Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold,
         not yet purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
         assets,  liabilities and members' capital. Primarily all investments in
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased and due from broker are positions
         with,  and  amounts  due  from,  the  prime  broker,   Morgan  Stanley.
         Accordingly, the Company has a concentration of individual counterparty
         credit risk with the prime broker. The Company pledges securities in an
         account at PFPC Trust Company,  for the benefit of the prime broker, to
         meet the margin requirement as determined by the prime broker.

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS  OF
         CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

         A swap is a contract  under  which two parties  agree to make  periodic
         payments to each other based on specified  interest  rates, an index or
         the value of some other instrument,  applied to a stated, or "notional"
         amount.  Swaps  generally  can be  classified  as interest  rate swaps,
         currency swaps,  commodity swaps or equity swaps which can also include
         contracts for difference,  depending on the type of index or instrument
         used to calculate the payments.  Such swaps would  increase or decrease
         the Company's  investment  exposure to the  particular  interest  rate,
         currency,  commodity or equity  involved.  Securities  associated  with
         swaps are marked-to-market  based on the Company's valuation procedures
         that are outlined in Section 2b of these notes.  The change in value of
         swaps,  including  the  periodic  amounts  of  interest  to be  paid or
         received on swaps,  is reported  as  unrealized  gains or losses in the
         Statement of Operations.  Net unrealized gains are reported as an asset
         and net unrealized  losses are reported as a liability on the Statement
         of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. A realized gain or loss is
         recorded upon payment or receipt of a periodic  payment or  termination
         of swap agreements.

         Most  swap   agreements   entered  into  by  the  Company  require  the
         calculation  of the  obligations  of the parties to the agreements on a
         "net basis." Consequently, current obligations (or rights) under a swap
         agreement  generally will be equal to only the net amount to be paid or
         received  under  the  agreement  based on the  relative  values  of the
         positions held by each party to the agreement (the "net amount").

         The Company is subject to the market risk  associated  with  changes in
         the  value  of the  underlying  investment  or  instrument,  as well as
         exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance on
         swap  contracts.  The risk of loss with  respect to swaps is limited to
         the net amount of payments that the Company is contractually  obligated
         to make. If the other party to a swap  defaults,  the Company's risk of
         loss   consists  of  the  net  amount  of  payments  that  the  Company
         contractually  is entitled to receive,  which may be different than the
         amounts  recorded on the Statement of Assets,  Liabilities and Members'
         Capital.

         The  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation,  rather  than the  notional
         amount,  represents the approximate future cash to be received or paid,
         respectively.

         The  Company may write  (sell) put and call  options on  securities  or
         derivative  instruments in order to gain exposure to or protect against
         changes in the markets.

         The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays
         a premium  whether or not the option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
         Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value

      7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS  OF
         CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

         When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company
         is recorded as a liability and is subsequently  adjusted to the current
         market  value of the  option  written.  If a  written  call  option  is
         exercised,  the premium is added to the  proceeds  from the sale of the
         underlying  security in determining  whether the Company has realized a
         gain or loss.  If a put option is  exercised,  the premium  reduces the
         cost basis of the  securities  purchased by the Company.  In writing an
         option,  the Company bears the market risk of an unfavorable  change in
         the price of the  security  or index  underlying  the  written  option.
         Exercise  of a written  option by a  counterparty  could  result in the
         Company  selling or buying a  security  at a price  different  from the
         current market value.  During for the year ended December 31, 2008, the
         Company had no transactions in written options.

         POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

         Actual or apparent  conflicts  of  interest  may arise when a Portfolio
         Manager  also has  day-to-day  responsibilities  with respect to one or
         more accounts. These potential conflicts include:

o        Allocation of Limited Time and Attention. Because the Portfolio Manager
         manages  other  accounts,  the  Portfolio  Manager  may  not be able to
         formulate  as  complete  a  strategy  or  identify  equally  attractive
         investment opportunities for each of those accounts as if the Portfolio
         Manager were to devote  substantially  more attention to the management
         of fewer accounts.

o        Allocation  of  Investment  Opportunities.  If  the  Portfolio  Manager
         identifies an investment  opportunity that may be suitable for multiple
         accounts,  the  Fund  may not be able to take  full  advantage  of that
         opportunity  because the opportunity may need to be allocated among all
         or many of these accounts.

o        Pursuit of Differing  Strategies.  At times, the Portfolio  Manager may
         determine that an investment  opportunity  may be appropriate  for only
         some of the accounts for which he exercises investment  responsibility,
         or may decide that  certain of these  accounts  should  take  differing
         positions with respect to a particular  security.  In these cases,  the
         Portfolio  Manager may execute  differing or opposite  transactions for
         one or more accounts  which may affect the market price of the security
         or the execution of the transactions,  or both, to the detriment of one
         or more of his accounts.

o        Performance Fees. The Portfolio Manager manages other accounts that are
         subject to a performance  allocation or  performance  fee which in some
         cases may be  greater  than the fee  payable  by the Fund.  This  could
         create a conflict  because the Portfolio  Manager may benefit if a more
         attractive  investment  is allocated to an account that bears a greater
         performance allocation or fee.


(A)(3)    COMPENSATION  STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO  MANAGER(S)  OR  MANAGEMENT  TEAM
          MEMBERS

         Mr.  Sparaggis'  compensation  consists  of periodic  advances  and the
         income from the profits of Alkeon  Capital  Management,  LLC derived by
         him as its sole  principal.  The level of Alkeon  Capital  Management's
         profitability in turn is dependent on the advisory fees and performance
         fees and allocations received from the Fund and other advisory clients.

                                                                   December 2008

  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS ADOPTED
  PURSUANT TO RULES PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF
                                      2002

I.        COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

          This  code  of  ethics  (the  "Code")  of  the  registered  investment
companies set forth in Exhibit A (collectively,  the "Funds" and each, a "Fund")
applies to each Fund's principal executive officer,  principal financial officer
and principal  accounting  officer (the "Covered  Officers," each of whom is set
forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

o         honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships;

o         full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in other  public  communications
          made by the Fund;

o         compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

o         the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

o         accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each  Covered  Officer  should  adhere to a high  standard of business
ethics and should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.       COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
          OF INTEREST


          OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
private  interest  interferes  with the interests  of, or the Covered  Officer's
service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.


          Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and a Fund and  already  are  subject to conflict of interest
provisions  in the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended  ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended  ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered  Officers may not  individually  engage in
certain  transactions  (such  as the  purchase  or sale of  securities  or other
property)  with a Fund  because of their status as  "affiliated  persons" of the
Fund.  The  compliance  programs and  procedures of each Fund and its investment
adviser are designed to prevent,  or identify and correct,  violations  of these
provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and  procedures,  and such  conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code.  Although  typically  not  presenting  an  opportunity  for  improper
personal  benefit,  conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship  between a Fund and its investment adviser or a third party service
provider of which the Covered  Officers  are also  officers or  employees.  As a
result,  this Code  recognizes  that the Covered  Officers  will,  in the normal
course of their  duties  (whether  formally for the  applicable  Fund or for its
investment  adviser or a third  party  service  provider,  or for one or more of
them), be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will
have different  effects on the adviser,  third party service  provider and Fund.
The  participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the
contractual  relationship  between a Fund and its adviser or third party service
provider and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their
duties as  officers of the Fund.  The  foregoing  activities,  if  performed  in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

<PAGE>

          Other  conflicts  of interest  are  covered by the Code,  even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to  provisions in the  Investment  Company
Act and the Investment  Advisers Act. The overarching  principle with respect to
all conflicts of interest covered by the Code is that the personal interest of a
Covered  Officer  should not be placed  improperly  before the  interest  of the
Company.

          Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

o         not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit  personally to the detriment
          of the Fund;

o         not cause the Fund to take  action,  or fail to take  action,  for the
          individual  personal  benefit of the Covered  Officer  rather than the
          benefit the Fund; and

o         report  at  least   annually   his  or  her   affiliations   or  other
          relationships  that could  potentially  present a conflict of interest
          with the Fund.

III.      DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

o         Each  Covered  Officer  of a  Fund  shall  become  familiar  with  the
          disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

o         each Covered  Officer of a Fund shall not knowingly  misrepresent,  or
          cause others to misrepresent,  facts about the Fund to others, whether
          within or outside the Fund,  including  to the Fund's  management  and
          auditors,   and  to   governmental   regulators  and   self-regulatory
          organizations;

o         each Covered Officer of a Fund may, to the extent  appropriate  within
          the Covered Officer's area of responsibility  and to the extent deemed
          necessary in the sole discretion of the Covered Officer,  consult with
          other  officers and employees of the Fund and its  investment  adviser
          with  the  goal  of  promoting  full,  fair,   accurate,   timely  and
          understandable  disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
          with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public  communications  made
          by the Fund; and

o         each Covered Officer should seek to promote the Fund's compliance by a
          Fund with applicable  standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
          laws, rules and regulations.

<PAGE>

IV.       REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

          Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

o         upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable,  upon becoming
          a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Compliance Officer of the
          Fund that the Covered  Officer has received,  read and understands the
          Code;

o         annually  thereafter affirm to the Compliance Officer of the Fund that
          the Covered Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code;

o         not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations of
          the Code that are made in good faith; and

o         notify the  Compliance  Officer of the Fund  promptly  if the  Covered
          Officer  knows of any  violation  of this  Code.  Failure  to do so is
          itself a violation of this Code.

          The Compliance Officer of a Fund is responsible for applying this Code
to specific  situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the
authority to interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  The Compliance
Officer of the Fund is authorized to consult,  as  appropriate,  with counsel to
the Fund  and  counsel  to the  Managers  of the  Fund  who are not  "interested
persons," as defined by Section  2(a)(19) of the Investment  Company Act, of the
Fund (the  "Independent  Managers"),  and is encouraged to do so.  However,  any
approvals or waivers(1) must be considered by the Independent Managers.

          Each Fund will follow these procedures in investigating  and enforcing
          this Code:

o         the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any reported potential violations;

o         if, after such investigation,  the Compliance Officer believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take
          any further action;

o         any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
          reported to the Independent Managers;

o         if the Independent Managers concur that a violation has occurred,  the
          Compliance Officer will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,
          which will consider appropriate action, which may include a review of,
          and appropriate  modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of the Fund's investment adviser
          or other relevant service provider; or a recommendation to dismiss the
          Covered Officer; and

o         any changes to or waivers of this Code will,  to the extent  required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

- -------------------------
(1)       For this purpose,  the term "waiver" includes the approval by the Fund
          of a material  departure from a provision of the code of ethics or the
          Fund's  failure  to take  action  within a  reasonable  period of time
          regarding a material  departure from a provision of the code of ethics
          that has been made known to Fund management.

<PAGE>

V.        OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          This Code  shall be the sole code of ethics  adopted  by the Funds for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of each Fund, the Fund's  investment  adviser,  principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions  of this  Code.  The  code of  ethics  under  Rule  17j-1  under  the
Investment  Company  Act of each Fund,  its  investment  adviser  and  principal
underwriter  is a separate  requirement  applying  to the Covered  Officers  and
others, and is not part of this Code.

VI.       AMENDMENTS

          Amendments  to this  Code may be made  from  time to time,  as  deemed
appropriate by each Fund's Compliance  Officer.  The Board of each Fund shall be
informed  of any such  amendment  to the extent  deemed  material  by the Fund's
Compliance Officer.

VII.      CONFIDENTIALITY

          All  reports and records  relating  to a Fund  prepared or  maintained
pursuant to this Code will be  considered  confidential  and shall be maintained
and  protected  accordingly.  Except as otherwise  required by law or this Code,
such matters  shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's  investment
adviser or Board, counsel to the Fund and counsel to the Independent Managers.

VIII.     INTERNAL USE

          The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not  constitute  an  admission,  by or on behalf  of any  Fund,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

           CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO RULE 30A-2(A) UNDER THE 1940 ACT
                    AND SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT



I, Bryan McKigney, certify that:

1.       I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of Advantage Advisers Xanthus
         Fund, LLC;

2.       Based  on my  knowledge,  this  report  does  not  contain  any  untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
         to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances  under which
         such  statements  were made, not misleading  with respect to the period
         covered by this report;

3.       Based on my knowledge,  the financial  statements,  and other financial
         information  included in this  report,  fairly  present in all material
         respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
         assets,  and cash flows (if the  financial  statements  are required to
         include a statement  of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for,
         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as

         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
         under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our
              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed

              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of

              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
