Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging through borrowings or issuance of
short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept of
leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained from
leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets received from
leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater
than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from the
securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's
net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the
amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

</TABLE>

Since June 2004, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has tirelessly advanced its
interest rate-hiking program, bringing the federal funds rate to 3.5% by August
31 (and to 3.75% on September 20). Economists and investors have struggled to
project the Fed's future moves, vacillating from expectations for an impending
end to monetary tightening to fears that the central bank may increase interest
rates more than is necessary to moderate economic growth and keep inflation in
check. Most recently, the devastation of Hurricane Katrina added a new element
of ambiguity in terms of its impact on the economy and Fed sentiment. Many now
believe the Fed will suspend its interest rate-hiking campaign at some point
this year.

Equity market returns over the past several months have reflected a degree of
investor uncertainty. After a strong finish to 2004, the S&P 500 Index posted
gains in four of the first eight months of 2005. Up to this point, strong
corporate earnings reports and low long-term bond yields have worked in favor of
equities. Factors that pose the greatest risks to stocks include record-high oil
prices, continued interest rate hikes and the possibility for disappointing
earnings for the remainder of the year.

Fixed income markets have fared relatively well in the face of monetary
tightening. As the short end of the yield curve moved in concert with Fed
interest rate hikes, long-term bond yields remained low, perpetuating the yield
curve flattening trend. Because bond prices move in the opposite direction of
yields, the result has been that longer-term bonds have outperformed short-term
bonds. At period end, the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields
was just 18 basis points (.18%).

Financial markets are likely to face continued crosscurrents for the remainder
of 2005, particularly as the economy digests the impact of Hurricane Katrina.
Nevertheless, opportunities do exist and we encourage you to work with your
financial advisor to diversify your portfolio among a variety of asset types.
This can help to diffuse risk while also tapping into the potential benefits of
a broader range of investment alternatives. As always, we thank you for trusting
Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your investment assets.

                                        Sincerely,


                                        /s/ Robert C. Doll, Jr.

                                        Robert C. Doll, Jr.

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      We continued our efforts to build a well-diversified portfolio and to
protect the Fund's underlying value in the case of rising long-term interest
rates.

How did the Fund perform during the period in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2005, the Common Stock of Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 9.29% and 9.42%, based on a
period-end per share net asset value of $6.79 and a per share market price of
$6.70, respectively, and $.318 per share income dividends. Over the same period,
the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +0.93%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $7.06 to $6.79, and assuming
reinvestment of all distributions. The Fund's total return for the period
trailed the +2.11% return of its benchmark, which is an equal blend of the
Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) High Yield Index and the CSFB Leveraged Loan
Index.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

The high yield market was highly volatile during the six-month reporting period.
General Motors Corp. (GM) announced higher-than-expected losses on March 16.
This exacerbated concerns that both GM and Ford Motor Co. would be lowered to
junk bond status and exerted significant downward pressure on the entire high
yield market. Concurrent with this development, the 10-year Treasury rate shot
up to 4.6% in the last week of March, adding yet more downward price pressure on
the high yield market. The Merrill Lynch High Yield Index declined 2.72% in
March and 1.04% in April. The market subsequently gained some perspective on the
GM and Ford downgrades and staged a four-month rally totaling approximately 4.9%
by August 31. This high yield upturn was complemented by a rally in the 10-year
Treasury rate, which finished the period at 4.02%, 58 basis points (.58%) off
its peak for the reporting period. The later part of this Treasury rally was
fueled by an investor flight to quality in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

Conditions in the leveraged loan market were much less unsettled than those in
the high yield bond market. Three primary factors account for this. First,
credit concerns have less of an impact on leveraged loans compared to high yield
bonds due to the senior secured status of most leveraged bank loans. Second,
leveraged bank loans are set off of the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR),
and are less affected by moves in long-term interest rates. Third, demand for
bank loans has been greatly boosted by the influx of collateralized loan
obligations (CLOs) into the market. For the eight months ended August 31, 2005,
we saw $26.2 billion in CLO issuance. Generally speaking, bank loans lack call
protection, and corporate treasurers have exploited this robust demand to
refinance at increasingly tighter spreads to LIBOR.

Despite increasing leverage and greater high yield issuance at the lower end of
the credit rating spectrum, default rates continued to decline, reaching their
lowest levels since 1994 at .45% for leveraged loans and .91% for high yield
bonds, as of June 30, 2005, according to CSFB. While strong market liquidity and
gross domestic product growth projections in the 3% - 4% range have enabled
companies to stretch their credit parameters, it must be noted that default
rates are a lagging indicator. The average incubation period for a high yield
credit default is roughly 36 months. Consequently, current rates are more
reflective of the underwriting standards of 2002 - 2003 than those of today.

What factors most influenced Fund performance?

The Fund's underperformance of the benchmark reflects the portfolio's relatively
aggressive credit stance. In general, credits rated B and CCC fared worse than
those rated BB during the credit correction prompted by the GM downgrade. Price
weakness was amplified by the Fund's leverage lines, which were actively used
during the period. The Fund's maximum leverage amount is 33%; we maintained
leverage in the 25% - 30% range during this reporting period.

Specific credits that detracted from performance during the past six months
included Anchor Glass Container Corp., Pliant Corp. and GEO Specialty Chemicals,
Inc. A common theme among these three investments is the meaningful impact that
high energy prices are having on U.S. manufacturers.


4       DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.              AUGUST 31, 2005
<PAGE>

In terms of Anchor Glass Container, we owned $9.625 million in bonds of this
glass bottle manufacturer priced at 101 as of February 28, 2005. We purchased
additional bonds on price weakness, leaving the Fund with an $11.9 million
position priced at 67 at period-end. Anchor Glass' financial performance
continued to weaken in the midst of high natural gas and soda ash prices,
culminating in a Chapter 11 filing on August 8, 2005.

The Fund's $12.3 million bond position in Pliant, a flexible plastic
manufacturing company, slid 25 points to 72 during the period. The company's
difficulty in passing along rising raw material costs, namely oil-based resins,
is a challenge facing the entire industry.

The price of our 339,340 share GEO equity position retreated from 15 per share
to 8.25 per share following weaker-than-expected profit margins. It appears that
the significantly higher raw material prices had not been fully reflected in
sales prices. GEO manufactures functional chemicals for a variety of markets,
including industrial water treatment, paints and coatings, construction and
electronics. We received this equity following the company's emergence from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2004.

Specific credits that made outsized contributions to performance during the
six-month reporting period included High Voltage Engineering Corporation (HVE),
Centerpoint Energy, Inc. and Loral Cyberstar, Inc. Our 501,000 shares of common
equity in HVE rallied from 1.50 per share to 9.00 per share during the period.
The price of this equity, which we received in 2004 via a Chapter 11
reorganization, had been under pressure as the company faced daunting liquidity
issues arising from overextended working capital positions. Subsequently, the
company's principal division, Robicon, was sold to Siemens AG at a surprisingly
strong multiple. This propelled the stock upward. We liquidated this position in
August.

The Fund's $7 million position in the convertible bonds of Centerpoint Energy
rallied from 113 to 120 during the period, as improving fundamentals drove the
common stock higher. Centerpoint is in the midst of a transition from an
integrated utility to a pure transmission and distribution company. During the
period, the stock also benefited from several favorable court rulings concerning
disposition of stranded asset costs.

At February 28, 2005, the Fund held a $2.5 million position in the bonds of
bankrupt satellite manufacturer Loral Cyberstar. The bonds were marked at 74. We
purchased another $4 million during the period at an average price of 74.52.
Since its emergence from Chapter 11, the company's operational prospects have
improved markedly and its bonds appreciated to 90.0 by period-end. We believe
the satellite market holds great promise.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

We continued to increase the Fund's exposure to floating rate notes during the
period, culminating in a portfolio composition of 60% fixed rate/40% floating
rate at period-end. Our primary concern has been, and continues to be, the
potential for a negative price impact on the Fund's net asset value if long-term
interest rates rise. Long-term interest rates actually declined (with the
10-year Treasury yield falling from 4.38% at February 28, 2005 to 4.02% at
August 31, 2005), and the Fund has paid the cost for our defensive shift in the
form of foregone interest. This cost, however, has been reduced as the
underlying LIBOR base for the floating rate investments has risen in lockstep
with the federal funds interest rate increases. At August 31, 2005, three-month
LIBOR was 3.87% versus 2.92% at February 28, 2005, and it should continue to
rise with future Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) interest rate increases. Since
June 2004, the Fed has increased the target short-term interest rate 11
consecutive times, from 1% to 3.75% as of September 20, 2005.

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

Going forward, we plan to maintain the portfolio's 60% fixed rate/40% floating
rate composition, relying on floating rate notes as opposed to bank loans, where
we have seen further spread compression. Our investment approach will continue
to be credit-driven, with the aim of maintaining a well-diversified investment
portfolio. We also intend to maintain our use of leverage within a target range
of 25% - 30%.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the
results for the interim period. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring
nature. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock shares are
listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations -- The Fund invests principally in debt
obligations of companies, including floating rate loans made by banks and other
financial institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds
and notes. Because agents and intermediaries are primarily commercial banks and
other financial institutions, the Fund's investment in floating rate loans could
be considered concentrated in financial institutions.

(b) Valuation of investments -- Floating rate loans are valued in accordance
with guidelines established by the Board of Directors. Floating rate loans are
valued at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or
more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the
limited number of floating rate loans for which no reliable price quotes are
available, such floating rate loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation
through the use of pricing matrixes to determine valuations. If the pricing
service does not provide a value for floating rate loans, the Investment Adviser
will value the floating rate loans at fair value, which is intended to
approximate market value.

Securities that are held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the
Nasdaq National Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price
on the exchange on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business
on the day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last
available bid price for long positions, and at the last available asked price
for short positions. In cases where securities are traded on more than one
exchange, the securities are valued on the exchange designated as the primary
market by or under the authority of the Board of Directors of the Fund. Long
positions in securities traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market, Nasdaq
Small Cap or Bulletin Board are valued at the last available bid price or yield
equivalent obtained from one or more dealers or pricing services approved by the
Board of Directors of the Fund. Floating rate loan interests are valued at the
mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or more brokers or
dealers as obtained from a pricing service. Short positions in securities traded
in the OTC market are valued at the last available asked price. Portfolio
securities that are traded both in the OTC market and on a stock exchange are
valued according to the broadest and most representative market. When the Fund
writes an option, the amount of the premium received is recorded on the books of
the Fund as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is
subsequently valued to reflect the current market value of the option written,
based on the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the
case of options traded in the OTC market, the last asked price. Options
purchased by the Fund are valued at their last sale price in the case of
exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded in the OTC market, the
last bid price. Swap agreements are valued based upon quoted fair valuations
received daily by the Fund from a pricing service or counterparty. Other
investments, including futures contracts and related options, are stated at
market value. Obligations with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost unless the Investment Adviser believes that this method
no longer produces fair valuations. Repurchase agreements will be valued at cost
plus accrued interest. The Fund employs certain pricing services to provide
securities prices for the Fund. Securities and assets for which market
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in
good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund,
including valuations furnished by the pricing services retained by the Fund,
which may use a matrix system for valuations. The procedures of a pricing
service and its valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the
general supervision of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures
will be reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. Government securities
and money market instruments, is substantially completed each day at various
times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities
used in computing the net asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of
such times. Foreign currency exchange rates also are generally determined prior
to the close of business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the values
of such securities and such exchange rates may occur between


        DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.              AUGUST 31, 2005               17
<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

the times at which they are determined and the close of business on the NYSE
that may not be reflected in the computation of the Fund's net asset value. If
events (for example, a company announcement, market volatility or a natural
disaster) occur during such periods that are expected to materially affect the
value of such securities, those securities may be valued at their fair value as
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or by the Investment Adviser
using a pricing service and/or procedures approved by the Board of Directors.

(c) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the
      change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
      loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may write covered call and put options and purchase
      call and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
      the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
      equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
      marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
      written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
      option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted
      from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to)
      the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund
      enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on
      the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss
      to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid
      or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are
      over-the-counter contracts in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to
      make periodic net payments on a specified notional amount. The net
      payments can be made for a set period of time or may be triggered by a
      pre-determined credit event. The net periodic payments may be based on a
      fixed or variable interest rate; the change in market value of a specified
      security, basket of securities, or index; or the return generated by a
      security. These periodic payments received or made by the Fund are
      recorded in the accompanying Statement of Operations as realized gains or
      losses, respectively. Gains or losses are also realized upon termination
      of the swap agreements. Swaps are marked-to-market daily and changes in
      value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Risks
      include changes in the returns of the underlying instruments, failure of
      the counterparties to perform under the contracts' terms and the possible
      lack of liquidity with respect to the swap agreements.

(d) Foreign currency transactions -- Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.

(e) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no


18      DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.              AUGUST 31, 2005
<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable foreign tax law,
a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and capital gains at
various rates.

(f) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(g) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(h) Securities lending -- The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least
100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market value of
the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any
additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business
day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the loaned securities,
it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically receives the income on
the loaned securities but does not receive the income on the collateral. Where
the Fund receives cash collateral, it may invest such collateral and retain the
amount earned on such investment, net of any amount rebated to the borrower.
Loans of securities are terminable at any time and the borrower, after notice,
is required to return borrowed securities within five business days. The Fund
may pay reasonable finder's, lending agent, administrative and custodial fees in
connection with its loans. In the event that the borrower defaults on its
obligation to return borrowed securities because of insolvency or for any other
reason, the Fund could experience delays and costs in gaining access to the
collateral. The Fund also could suffer a loss where the value of the collateral
falls below the market value of the borrowed securities, in the event of
borrower default or in the event of losses on investments made with cash
collateral.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to perform the investment advisory function. For such services, the Fund pays a
monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average weekly net assets
plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated, an affiliate of FAM, or its affiliates. Pursuant to
that order, the Fund also has retained Merrill Lynch Investment Managers, LLC
("MLIM, LLC"), an affiliate of FAM, as the securities lending agent for a fee
based on a share of the returns on investment of cash collateral. MLIM, LLC may,
on behalf of the Fund, invest cash collateral received by the Fund for such
loans, among other things, in a private investment company managed by MLIM, LLC
or in registered money market funds advised by FAM or its affiliates.

For the six months ended August 31, 2005, the Fund reimbursed FAM $8,050 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, PSI, ML & Co., and/or MLIM, LLC.

3. Investments:

Purchases and sales (including paydowns) of investments, excluding short-term
securities, for the six months ended August 31, 2005 were $242,780,552 and
$213,410,682, respectively.

$1,000,000, which would be extended at the option of the borrower, pursuant to
the following loan agreement:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                     Unfunded

Quest Cherokee LLC ....................................................  $1,000
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Short-Term Borrowings:

On May 24, 2005, the Fund renewed its revolving credit and security agreement
funded by a commercial paper asset securitization program with Citigroup North
America, Inc. ("Citigroup") as Agent, certain secondary backstop lenders, and
certain asset securitization conduits as lenders (the "Lenders"). The agreement
was renewed for one year and has a maximum limit of $370,000,000. Under the
Citigroup program, the conduits will fund advances to the Fund through the
issuance of highly rated commercial paper. As security for its obligations to
the Lenders under the revolving securitization facility, the Fund has granted a
security interest in substantially all of its assets to and in favor of the
Lenders. The interest rate on the Fund's borrowings is based on the interest
rate carried by the commercial paper plus a program fee. The Fund pays
additional borrowing costs including a backstop commitment fee.

The weighted average annual interest rate was 3.35% and the average borrowing
was approximately $298,546,000 for the six months ended August 31, 2005.

7. Capital Loss Carryforward:

On February 28, 2005, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
$326,319,995, of which $12,067,388 expires in 2006, $27,376,921 expires in 2007,
$51,234,056 expires in 2008, $21,442,332 expires in 2009, $90,564,493 expires in
2010, $85,285,305 expires in 2011, $17,223,475 expires in 2012 and $21,126,025
expires in 2013. This amount will be available to offset like amounts of any
future taxable gains.

8. Subsequent Event:

The Fund paid an ordinary income dividend in the amount of $.053000 per share on
September 30, 2005 to shareholders of record on September 14, 2005.

Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement

Activities of and Composition of the Board of Directors

All but one member of the Board of Directors is an independent director whose
only affiliation with Fund Asset Management, L.P. (the "Investment Adviser") or
other Merrill Lynch affiliates is as a director of the Fund and certain other
funds advised by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates. The Chairman of the
Board is also an independent director. New director nominees are chosen as
nominees by a Nominating Committee comprised of independent directors. All
independent directors also are members of the Board's Audit Committee and the
independent directors meet in executive session at each in-person Board meeting.
The Board and the Audit Committee meet in person for at least two days each
quarter and conduct other in-person and telephone meetings throughout the year,
some of which are formal board meetings, and some of which are informational
meetings. The independent counsel to the independent directors attends all
in-person Board and Audit Committee meetings and other meetings at the
independent directors' request.

Investment Advisory Agreement -- Matters Considered by the Board

Every year, the Board considers approval of the Fund's investment advisory
agreement (the "Investment Advisory Agreement"). The Board assesses the nature,
scope and quality of the services provided to the Fund by the personnel of the
Investment Adviser and its affiliates, including administrative services,
shareholder services, oversight of fund accounting, marketing services and
assistance in meeting legal and regulatory requirements. The Board also receives
and assesses information regarding the services provided to the Fund by certain
unaffiliated service providers.

At various times throughout the year, the Board also considers a range of
information in connection with its oversight of the services provided by the
Investment Adviser and its affiliates. Among the matters considered are: (a)
fees (in addition to management fees) paid to the Investment Adviser and its
affiliates by the Fund, such as transfer agency fees; (b) Fund operating
expenses paid to third parties; (c) the resources devoted to and compliance
reports relating to the Fund's investment objective, policies and restrictions,
and its compliance with its Code of Ethics and the Investment Adviser's
compliance policies and procedures; and (d) the nature, cost and character of
non-investment management services provided by the Investment Adviser and its
affiliates.

The Board believes that the Investment Adviser is one of the most experienced
global asset management firms and considers the overall services provided by the
Investment Adviser to be generally of high quality. The Board also believes that
the Investment Adviser is financially sound and well managed and notes that the
Investment Adviser is affiliated with one of America's largest financial firms.
The Board works closely with the Investment Adviser in overseeing the Investment
Adviser's efforts to achieve good performance. As part of this effort, the Board
discusses portfolio manager effectiveness and, when performance is not
satisfactory, discusses with the Investment Adviser taking steps such as
changing investment personnel.

Annual Consideration of Approval by the Board of Directors

In the period prior to the Board meeting to consider renewal of the Investment
Advisory Agreement, the Board requested and received materials specifically
relating to the Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement. These materials included
(a) information compiled by Lipper Inc. ("Lipper") on the fees and expenses and
the investment performance of the Fund as compared to a comparable group of
funds as classified by Lipper; (b) information comparing the Fund's market price
with its net asset value per share; (c) a discussion by the Fund's portfolio
management team of investment strategies used by the Fund during its most recent
fiscal year; (d) information on the profitability to the Investment Adviser and
its affiliates of the Investment Advisory Agreement and other relationships with
the Fund; and (e) information provided by the Investment Adviser concerning
investment advisory fees charged to other clients, such as offshore funds under
similar investment mandates and generally to institutional clients. The Board
also considers other matters it deems important to the approval process such as
services related to the valuation and pricing of Fund portfolio holdings,
allocation of Fund brokerage fees (including the related benefits to the
Investment Adviser of "soft dollars"), the Fund's portfolio turnover statistics,
and direct and indirect benefits to the Investment Adviser and its affiliates
from their relationship with the Fund.

Certain Specific Renewal Data

In connection with the most recent renewal of the Fund's Investment Advisory
Agreement in August 2005, the independent directors' and Board's review included
the following:

Disclosure of Investment Advisory Agreement (concluded)

Services Provided by the Investment Adviser -- The Board reviewed the nature,
extent and quality of services provided by the Investment Adviser, including the
investment advisory services and the resulting performance of the Fund. The
Board focused primarily on the Investment Adviser's investment advisory services
and the Fund's investment performance, having concluded that the other services
provided to the Fund by the Investment Adviser were satisfactory. The Board
compared Fund performance -- both including and excluding the effects of the
Fund's fees and expenses -- to the performance of a comparable group of mutual
funds, and the performance of a relevant index or combination of indexes. While
the Board reviews performance data at least quarterly, consistent with the
Investment Adviser's investment goals, the Board attaches more importance to
performance over relatively long periods of time, typically three to five years.
The Fund's performance after fees and expenses ranked in the third quintile
compared to its peers for the one-year period ended May 31, 2005; in the first
quintile compared to its peers for the three-year period ended May 31, 2005; and
in the second quintile compared to its peers for the five-year period ended May
31, 2005. Considering these factors, the Board concluded that the Fund's
performance supported the continuation of the Investment Advisory Agreement.

The Investment Adviser's Personnel and Investment Process -- The Board reviewed
the Fund's investment objectives and strategies. The Board discussed with senior
management of the Investment Adviser responsible for investment operations and
the senior management of the Investment Adviser's taxable fixed-income investing
group the strategies being used to achieve the stated objectives. Among other
things, the Board considered the size, education and experience of the
Investment Adviser's investment staff, its use of technology, and the Investment
Adviser's approach to training and retaining portfolio managers and other
research, advisory and management personnel. The Board also reviewed the
Investment Adviser's compensation policies and practices with respect to the
Fund's portfolio manager. The Board also considered the experience of the Fund's
portfolio manager and noted that Mr. Booth has more than twenty years experience
in the financial industry. The Board noted that the Investment Adviser and its
investment staff have extensive experience in analyzing and managing the types
of investments used by the Fund. The Board concluded that the Fund benefits from
that expertise.

Management Fees and Other Expenses -- The Board reviewed the Fund's contractual
management fee rate and actual management fee rate as a percentage of total
assets at common asset levels -- the actual rate includes advisory and
administrative service fees and the effects of any fee waivers -- compared to
the other funds in its Lipper category. It also compared the Fund's total
expenses to those of other comparable funds. The Board considered the services
provided to and the fees charged by the Investment Adviser to other types of
clients, such as offshore funds, with similar investment mandates and noted that
the fees charged by the Investment Adviser in those cases typically exceeded
those being charged to the Fund. The Board also noted that, as a general matter,
fees charged to institutional clients were lower than the fees charged to the
Fund, but believed that less extensive services were being provided to such
clients. The Fund's contractual and actual management fee rates were lower than
the median fees charged by comparable funds, as determined by Lipper. The Board
has concluded that the Fund's management fee and fee rate and overall expense
ratio are acceptable compared to those of other comparable funds.

Profitability -- The Board considered the cost of the services provided to the
Fund by the Investment Adviser, and the Investment Adviser's and its affiliates'
profits in relating to the management of the Fund and the MLIM/FAM-advised
funds. As part of its analysis, the Board reviewed the Investment Adviser's
methodology in allocating its costs to the management of the Fund and concluded
that there was a reasonable basis for the allocation. The Board believes the
Investment Adviser's profits are acceptable in relation to the nature and
quality of services provided and given the level of fees and expenses overall.

Economies of Scale -- The Board considered whether there have been economies of
scale in respect of the management of MLIM/FAM-advised funds, whether the
MLIM/FAM-advised funds (including the Fund) have appropriately benefited from
any economies of scale, and whether there is potential for realization of any
further economies of scale. The Board considered economies of scale to the
extent applicable to the Fund's closed-end structure and determined that no
changes were currently necessary.

Conclusion

After the independent directors deliberated in executive session, the entire
Board, including all of the independent directors, approved the renewal of the
existing Investment Advisory Agreement, concluding that the advisory fee was
reasonable in relation to the services provided and that a contract renewal was
in the best interests of the shareholders.

            necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances

                  the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
                  that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
                  materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

      5.    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to
            the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
            registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the

                  design or operation of internal control over financial
