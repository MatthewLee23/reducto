Item 1. Report to Shareholders

       Welcome, Shareholder

       In this update, you'll learn about how your fund performed during the
       reporting period. The portfolio manager will provide an overview of the
       market climate, and discuss some of the factors that helped or hindered
       performance during the reporting period. In addition, this report
       includes the fund's financial statements and a list of fund investments,
       as well as other information.

       This material must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus for the
       fund being offered.

       Market forecasts provided in this report may not necessarily come to
       pass. There is no assurance that the fund will achieve its investment
       objective. The fund is subject to market risk which is the possibility
       that the market values of securities owned by the fund will decline and,
       therefore, the value of the fund shares may be less than what you paid
       for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this fund. Please
       see the prospectus for more complete information on investment risks.

       An investment in senior loans is subject to certain risks such as loan
       defaults and illiquidity due to insufficient collateral backing.

Fund Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JULY 31, 2003

       Howard Tiffen, Managing Director, is primarily responsible for the day-
       to-day management of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund. The following
       discussion reflects his views on the fund's performance.

Q.     BEFORE YOU DISCUSS HOW THE FUND PERFORMED, PLEASE DESCRIBE THE
       OVERALL MARKET ENVIRONMENT.

A.     The market over the past year can really be divided into two distinct
       segments. During the first six months of the reporting period, a stagnant
       economy, lack of corporate earning power, and the effects of a series of
       corporate-governance scandals resulted in a very difficult environment
       for senior loans.

       During the latter half of the period, however, the market improved
       dramatically. Absolute levels of corporate profitability began to
       increase, the number of debt refinancings rose considerably, and default
       rates began to subside. As a result, bank loan prices rallied. We believe
       this marked improvement was the result of several factors. First,
       corporate management has been forced to learn how to better operate in a
       low-growth, low-inflation environment, which has led to stronger
       corporate valuations. Second, more companies have been able to issue
       long-term debt to shore up their balance sheets. And lastly, we began to
       see many companies that were in bankruptcy two to three years ago return
       to performing status and earn a profit.

Q.     HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.      --  The fund returned 6.58 percent for the twelve months ended July 31,
            2003. This return is for Class B shares, assumes the reinvestment of
            all distributions, but does not reflect the deduction of any
            applicable early withdrawal charges. If these charges were included,
            performance would be lower. Past performance is no guarantee of
            future results.

        --  The fund's monthly dividend of $.0244 for Class B shares translated
            to a distribution rate of 3.54 percent based on the fund's offering
            price on July 25, 2003.

       See Performance Summary for additional information.

Q.     WHAT FACTORS HELPED PERFORMANCE?

        --  As mentioned earlier, declining default rates, improved corporate
            profitability and increased loan issuance, as well as an overall
            improving economy, all contributed to performance.

        --  A deeper secondary trading market in senior loans created greater
            opportunities for us to capture value. This, coupled with the

 2
<PAGE>

            appreciation of bank loan prices overall, helped boost the fund's
            return and net asset value.

        --  In addition, our team now includes a total of 24 analysts, who have
            an average of 16 years of industry experience. Given that we employ
            a bottom-up investment approach, we believe that such a large team
            has enabled us to conduct even more in-depth analysis of every
            investment candidate as well as all existing portfolio holdings, and
            is vital to our ongoing success.

Q.     WHAT HINDERED PERFORMANCE DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD?

A.      --  Early in the reporting period, flat corporate performance and a low
            level of issuance dampened fund returns and left us with few
            compelling new investment opportunities. However, we saw marked
            improvement here in the last several months.

        --  While we have seen default rates decline, they are still at
            higher-than-normal levels. The number of issuers in the portfolio
            that are in default (defined here as those not paying principal
            and/or interest as contractually obligated) has also declined, by
            approximately 45 percent since this same period last year.

        --  Because senior-loan coupon rates float with short-term market rates,
            the near-record low interest rates throughout the entire period also
            held the fund back.

Q.     PLEASE WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU POSITIONED THE FUND, HIGHLIGHTING
       KEY THEMES.

A.     We employed a variety of strategies during the period:

        --  In an effort to build value and avoid losses in the portfolio, we
            made greater use of the secondary market, where we were able to
            purchase loans at or below their repayment or recovery values. In
            fact, we now have two analysts on our team who are largely dedicated
            to this market, conducting transactions daily.

        --  We continued to keep the portfolio highly diversified by issuer. As
            of July 31, the fund contained a total of 291 issuers. Typically,
            each of the fund's ten largest holdings represents less than two
            percent of total assets. We believe that a high level of
            diversification--not only in this environment but going forward as
            well--is instrumental to successful investing in the senior loan
            asset class.

        --  We strive to manage the fund as defensively as possible, and
            therefore, don't typically favor individual sectors. Some sectors
            may, however, fall out of favor from time to time. For example, we
            have chosen to reduce the fund's exposure to the auto and aerospace
            segments because we believe they are likely to deliver poor profits,
            and the value of collateral they can offer is also likely to fall.
            The fund's exposure to the health-care sector did increase slightly
            over the past year. We believe that certain parts of this sector
            have seen a significant improvement in business fundamentals, making
            some companies in the sector more attractive investments than they
            had previously been.

        --  We continued with our long-term strategy of focusing on companies
            that we believe demonstrate solid management strength--those that
            have learned to improve productivity in a low-inflation environment
            and keep their costs low.

Q.     NOW THAT YOU'VE PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE FUND, DO YOU HAVE ANY
       CLOSING THOUGHTS FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS?

A.     We believe that the turnaround we've seen in the senior loan market as of
       late is based upon fundamentally-sound factors that may continue to
       positively influence the market. We also anticipate that default rates
       may continue their downward trend as the bankruptcies that occurred
       between 1999 and 2002 increasingly work their way through the system.

       While no one can predict with certainty where or when interest rates will
       bottom out, we believe it's likely that short-term rates may rise, or at
       least remain stable, over the next several months. Such an environment,
       coupled with more robust corporate performance, has historically been
       quite favorable for senior loans. Going forward, we will continue with
       our disciplined investment approach, monitoring the market closely for
       opportunities.

                                                                               5

NR--Not rated

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade. (Bank
    loan ratings are unaudited.)

(1) Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets.

(a) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements

(b) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Restricted security.

(e) Non-income producing security as this stock currently does not declare
    dividends.

(f) 144A Securities are those which are exempt from registration under Rule 144A
    of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(g) This borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at July 31,
    2003.

(i) A portion of this security is designated in connection with unfunded loan
    commitments.

(j) Payment-in-kind security.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

July 31, 2003

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (formerly, Van Kampen Prime Rate Income Trust) (the
"Fund") is registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Fund invests
primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans. Senior Loans are business loans that
have a senior right to payment and are made to borrowers that may be
corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These borrowers operate in a
variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund commenced investment
operations on October 4, 1989. In June 2003, the Fund completed a transaction in
which it redesignated its shares issued before June 13, 2003 as Class B Shares
and issued new Class C Shares to the shareholders of Van Kampen Senior Floating
Rate Fund in exchange for the assets and liabilities of that fund.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans are valued by the Fund following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Fund's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp. (the
"Adviser") by considering a number of factors including consideration of market
indicators, transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be
comparable (including comparable credit quality, interest rate redetermination
period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the current
interest rate, the period until the next interest rate redetermination and the
maturity of such Senior Loans. Consideration of comparable instruments may
include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term
variable rate securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior
Loans in the Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and
approved by the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment. The Fund may invest in repurchase

agreements, which are short-term investments in which the Fund acquires
ownership of a debt security and the seller agrees to repurchase the security at
a future time and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully
collateralized by the underlying debt security. The Fund will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer
to the account of the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the
value of the underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due
the Fund.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.

C. INCOME AND EXPENSES Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for service
fees, which are applicable only to Class C shares.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2003, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $727,526,397, which will expire between July 31, 2004 and
July 31, 2011.

    At July 31, 2003, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Fund declares daily and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, are
distributed at least annually. Distributions from net realized gains for book
purposes may include short-term capital gains, which are included as ordinary
income for tax purposes.

                                                                              35

                                                              ===========    ============
</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between financial and tax basis reporting for the 2003 fiscal year have been
identified and appropriately reclassified on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. Permanent differences relating to return of capital distributions
totaling $7,501,943 were reclassified from accumulated undistributed net
investment income to capital. Also, permanent differences relating to book to
tax amortization differences totaling $21,719,457 were reclassified from
accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized
loss.

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses related to wash sale
transactions, post October losses which may not be recognized for tax purposes
until the first day of the following fiscal year, and losses that were
recognized for book purposes but not for tax purposes at the end of the fiscal
year.

F. CREDITS EARNED ON CASH BALANCES During the year ended July 31, 2003, the
Fund's custody fee was reduced by $101,748 as a result of credits earned on cash
balances.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Fund's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Fund for an annual fee payable
monthly as follows:

</Table>

    In addition, the Fund will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen
Funds Inc., the Fund's Administrator, at an annual rate of .25% of the average
daily net assets of the Fund. The administrative services to be provided by the
Administrator include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any
agreements with respect to participations and assignments, record keeping
responsibilities with respect to interests in Senior Loans in the Fund's
portfolio and providing certain services to the holders of the Fund's
securities.

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

July 31, 2003

    The Fund has entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate led
by Bank of America for an aggregate of $500,000,000, which will terminate on
November 7, 2003. The proceeds of any borrowing by the Fund under the revolving
credit agreement shall be used for temporary liquidity purposes and funding of
shareholder tender offers. Annual commitment fees of .11% are charged on the
unused portion of the credit line. For the year ended July 31, 2003, the Fund
recognized commitment fee expenses of approximately $638,400. Borrowings under
this facility will bear interest at either the LIBOR rate or the Federal Funds
rate plus .50%.

8. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

    At July 31, 2003, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Fund on a participation
basis.

the service fee requirements of the sales charge rule of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The Plan governs payments for personal
services and/or the maintenance of shareholder accounts.

                                                                              41

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund"), including the portfolio of investments, as
of July 31, 2003, the related statements of operations and cash flows for the
year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for the two years in
the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the four years
in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights
are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based
on our audits. The Fund's financial highlights for the periods ended prior to
July 31, 2000 were audited by other auditors whose report, dated September 14,
1999, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of July 31, 2003, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers, and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received,
we performed other auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Senior Loan Fund as of July 31, 2003, the results of its operations, cash
flows, the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for the
respective stated periods, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, L.P., Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley Investment Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management
Company, Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Investments LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP,
Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., Van Kampen Asset Management Inc., and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each a "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will vote proxies as part of its authority to manage,
acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the MSIM registered
management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and Advisor
Funds) (collectively referred to as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM Fund will vote
proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable investment advisory
agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as authorized by its Board of
Directors or Trustees. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named
fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the
case of an account not governed by ERISA, the Investment Management Agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in
a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients,
including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for
which we manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term
investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a client or
its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a statement of proxy voting
policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's
policy unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable laws or regulations
or the MSIM Affiliate's fiduciary responsibility.

Proxy Research Services - To assist the MSIM Affiliates in their responsibility
for voting proxies and the overall global proxy voting process, Institutional
Shareholder Services ("ISS") and the Investor Responsibility Research Center
("IRRC") have been retained as experts in the proxy voting and corporate
governance area. ISS and IRRC are independent advisers that specialize in
providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services to institutional
investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians,

consultants, and other institutional investors. The services provided to MSIM
Affiliates include in-depth research, global issuer analysis, and voting
recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote execution,
reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A.
below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by the proxy
research services.

Voting Proxies for certain Non-US Companies - While the proxy voting process is
well established in the United States and other developed markets with a number
of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting proxies
of non-US companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly emerging
markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent a MSIM
Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are not
limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language other
than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder meetings;
(iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's jurisdiction
of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote proxies in person,
(v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the securities for a period of
time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide
local agents with power of attorney to facilitate the MSIM Affiliate's voting
instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies will be voted on a best
efforts basis only, consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. ISS has been
retained to provide assistance to the MSIM Affiliates in connection with voting
their clients' non-US proxies.

II.      GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) these Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, including the guidelines set forth below. These
guidelines address a broad range of issues, including board size and
composition, executive compensation, anti-takeover proposals, capital structure
proposals and social responsibility issues and are meant to be general voting
parameters on issues that arise most frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however,
may vote in a manner that is contrary to the following general guidelines,
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section IV. below, provided the vote is
consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

                  subject to the review and approval of the Proxy Review

                                    10% of the issued capital at the time of
                                    approval.

                  -        Proposals requiring shareholder ratification of
                           poison pills.

                  -        Anti-takeover and related provisions that serve to
                           prevent the majority of shareholders from exercising
                           their rights or effectively deter the appropriate

                           nature or would provide no pertinent information from

IV.       ADMINISTRATION OF PROXY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A.       PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

         1.       The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible
                  for creating and implementing MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and
                  Procedures and, in this regard, has expressly adopted them.
                  Following are some of the functions and responsibilities of
                  the Committee.

                  (a)      The Committee, which will consist of members
                           designated by MSIM's Chief Investment Officer, is
                           responsible for establishing MSIM's proxy voting
                           policies and guidelines and determining how MSIM will
                           vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

                  (b)      The Committee will periodically review and have the
                           authority to amend as necessary MSIM's proxy voting
                           policies and guidelines (as expressed in these Proxy
                           Voting Policy and Procedures) and establish and
                           direct voting positions consistent with the Client
                           Proxy Standard.

                  (c)      The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among
                           other matters): (1) address any outstanding issues
                           relating to MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and
                           Procedures; and (2) generally review proposals at
                           upcoming shareholder meetings of MSIM portfolio
                           companies in accordance with this Policy and
                           Procedures including, as appropriate, the voting
                           results of prior shareholder meetings of the same
                           issuer where a similar proposal was presented to
                           shareholders. The Committee, or its designee, will
                           timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy
                           and Procedures (and any amendments to them and/or any
                           additional guidelines or procedures it may adopt).

                  (d)      The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among
                           other matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e.,
                           allowing certain shares of the same issuer that are
                           the subject of the same proxy solicitation and held
                           by one or more MSIM portfolios to be voted
                           differently than other shares) and/or "override
                           voting" (i.e., voting

<PAGE>




                           all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner contrary to the
                           Procedures); (2) review and approve upcoming votes,
                           as appropriate, for matters for which specific
                           direction has been provided in Sections I, II, and
                           III above; and (3) determine how to vote matters for
                           which specific direction has not been provided in
                           Sections I, II and III above. Split votes will
                           generally not be approved within a single Global
                           Investor Group team. The Committee may take into
                           account ISS recommendations and the research provided
                           by IRRC as well as any other relevant information
                           they may request or receive.

                  (e)      In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                           Committee determines that an issue raises a potential
                           material conflict of interest, or gives rise to the
                           appearance of a potential material conflict of
                           interest, the Committee will designate a special
                           committee to review, and recommend a course of action
                           with respect to, the conflict(s) in question
                           ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee may
                           request the assistance of the Law and Compliance
                           Departments and will have sole discretion to cast a
                           vote. In addition to the research provided by ISS and
                           IRRC, the Special Committee may request analysis from
                           MSIM Affiliate investment professionals and outside
                           sources to the extent it deems appropriate.

                  (f)      The Committee and the Special Committee, or their
                           designee(s), will document in writing all of their
                           decisions and actions, which documentation will be
                           maintained by the Committee and the Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s) for a period of at
                           least 6 years. To the extent these decisions relate
                           to a security held by a MSIM U.S. registered
                           investment company, the Committee and Special
                           Committee, or their designee(s), will report their
                           decisions to each applicable Board of
                           Trustees/Directors of those investment companies at
                           each Board's next regularly Scheduled Board meeting.
                           The report will contain information concerning
                           decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee
                           during the most recently ended calendar quarter
                           immediately preceding the Board meeting.

                  (g)      The Committee and Special Committee, or their
                           designee(s), will timely communicate to applicable
                           PMs, the Compliance Departments and, as necessary to
                           ISS, decisions of the Committee and Special Committee
                           so that, among other things, ISS will vote proxies
                           consistent with their decisions.

          CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL
                                    OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         -        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         -        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         -        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         -        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         -        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or

<PAGE>





replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the
parameters of this Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any
violation of such programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         -        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally (directly or indirectly) to the detriment
                  of the Fund;

         -        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; or

         -        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family

<PAGE>





living in the same household engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship.  Examples of these include:

         -        service or significant business relationships as a director on
                  the board of any public or private company;

         -        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional meals
                  or tickets for theatre or sporting events or other similar
                  entertainment; provided it is business-related, reasonable in
                  cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as
                  to raise any question of impropriety;

         -        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
                  affiliated person thereof; and

         -        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         -        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with
                  the disclosure and compliance requirements generally
                  applicable to the Funds;

         -        each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations;

         -        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Funds and their investment advisers with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
                  Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
                  communications made by the Funds; and

         -        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         -        upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;



<PAGE>





         -        annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         -        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer
                  or any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                  reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                  and

         -        notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or
                  suspects of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
                  itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(1) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         -        the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         -        if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not
                  required to take any further action;

         -        any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

         -        if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are
                  not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company
                  Act (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                  Partners") of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has
                  occurred, they will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board;
                  or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other
                  appropriate disciplinary actions;

         -        the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners
                  of the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers
                  of this Code, as appropriate; and

         -        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of


- -----------------
(1) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<PAGE>





the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal underwriters, or other
service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the
Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code
to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code
unless any provision of this Code conflicts with any applicable federal or state
law, in which case the requirements of such law will govern. The Funds' and
their investment advisers' and principal underwriters' codes of ethics under
Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics
are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B
or C, must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each
Fund, including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Independent
Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and
their counsel, the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant
investment adviser and its counsel.



<PAGE>

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial

     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the

a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material

     subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities,
     particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

b)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and

     committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
     equivalent functions):

a)   all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
     controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
     process, summarize, and report financial data and have identified for the
     registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and

b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
     controls; and

6.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
     report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls
     or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls
     subsequent to the date of our most recent evaluation, including any
     corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material
     weaknesses.
