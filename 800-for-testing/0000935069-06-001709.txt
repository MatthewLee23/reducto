COMMENTARY
================================================================================
Hedge fund strategies performed well in March, driven by long/short equity and
event driven strategies. Equity markets were strong globally, with Japan leading
the developed markets. Global fixed income markets sold off as the U.S. yield
curve steepened. Commodity prices advanced broadly. Global strategies were
mixed, as bond prices declined in anticipation of potential rate hikes.
Long/short equity strategies were positive due to powerful directional rallies
in industrials, materials and energy. Additionally, small-cap stocks continue to
outperform large-cap stocks. Event driven strategies were positive given the
favorable market environment for corporate activity. Distressed and performing
corporate credit strategies produced gains.

             -------------------------------------------------------

To the Members and Board of Directors
Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC
- -Multi-Strategy Series G

We have  audited  the  accompanying  statement  of  assets  and  liabilities  of
Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge  Fund   Portfolios
LLC-Multi-Strategy Series G, including the schedule of investments,  as of March
31, 2006, and the related  statement of operations for the year then ended,  the
statements of changes in members'  capital for each of the years in the two-year
period then ended,  the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the
financial  highlights for each of the years in the three-year  period then ended
and the period from January 1, 2003  (commencement  of  operations) to March 31,
2003. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility
of the Fund's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included verification of
investments owned as of March 31, 2006, by inspection of investment subscription
documents and  confirmation  with  underlying  investment  funds.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by  management,   as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall   financial   statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of
Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge  Fund   Portfolios
LLC-Multi-Strategy Series G, as of March 31, 2006, the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended,  the changes in its members' capital
for each of the years in the  two-year  period  then  ended,  and the  financial
highlights  for each of the years in the  three-year  period  then ended and the
period  from  January 1, 2003  through  March 31, 2003 in  conformity  with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC (the  "Company"  or "Fund")  was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited
         Liability  Company on August 16, 2002. The Company is registered  under
         the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as amended,  as a
         closed-end,  non-diversified management investment company. The Company
         is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").  The
         Company  consists of two separate series,  Multi-Strategy  Series M and
         Multi-Strategy  Series G (each a "Series").  The  financial  statements
         included  herein  are  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  G.  The  investment
         objective of Multi-Strategy Series G is to achieve capital appreciation
         principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment  Funds")
         managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
         employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series G can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Shares  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G are  sold to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series G from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         from  January 1, 2003 to  November 1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional
         investment is $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments  LLC ("CAI" or "the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series G's
         assets to various  Investment  Funds.  AMACAR  Partners,  Inc.  was the
         managing member of Multi-Strategy Series G prior to the conversion to a
         regulated  investment  company.  As  of  October  1,  2005,  under  the
         Multi-Strategy   Series  G's  governing  documents,   the  Company  has
         delegated  substantially all authority to oversee the management of the
         operations  and  assets  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G to the  Board of
         Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements and offering memoranda. Multi-Strategy Series G values these
         investments  at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the
         Investment Funds.

         A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series G is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2006 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Multi-Strategy  Series G's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates assets will charge Multi-Strategy Series G, as investor in an
         underlying  Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the
         Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in the
         form of an  incentive  fee.  The  asset-based  fees  of the  Investment
         Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the
         net assets under their  management  and the  incentive fee is generally
         expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  G's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  G can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series G's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information  available at the time.
         The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
         monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally require advance notice
         of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending on the
         Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or delay a  redemption
         request.  Multi-Strategy  Series G does not factor into its valuation a
         liquidity  discount  on  any  Investment  Funds  held.  The  underlying
         investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as
         described  in  each  Investment   Fund's  financial   statements.   The
         Investment  Funds may  invest a portion of their  assets in  restricted

         applicable  to  regulated  investment  companies  (RIC) and  distribute
         substantially  all of its  taxable  net  investment  income and capital
         gains, if any, to shareholders each year. Therefore,  no federal income
         or excise tax provision is typically required for Multi-Strategy Series
         G's  financial  statements.  However,  during  fiscal  2006,  the  Fund
         incurred  $14,590 of excise tax which is  recognized  as a component of
         Miscellaneous expenses. This expense was attributable to the conversion
         to RIC status.

         D.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A. account that earn money market rates and are accounted for at cost
         plus accrued interest.

         E.   CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE

         Contributions   received  in  advance  of  $5,986,025  represent  funds
         received for  subscriptions to be credited to Members' capital accounts
         on April 1, 2006.

         F.   RECEIVABLE FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

         Receivable from investment funds of $10,780,202  represents amounts due
         to Multi-Strategy Series G for sales of interests in certain investment
         funds. Of this receivable, $10,724,208 is receivable from the March 31,
         2006 sale of The  Capital  Hedge Fund  Ltd.,  and was  received  by the
         Company on April 19, 2006. The remaining $55,994 is receivable from the
         June 30, 2005 sale of Post  Opportunity  Fund, L.P., and is expected to
         be received by the Fund upon completion of the Post Opportunity  Fund's
         2005 audit.

         G.   USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing Multi-Strategy Series G's financial
         statements are reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could
         differ from these estimates.

     3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY
         TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to Multi-Strategy Series G. CAI acts primarily to evaluate and
         select Investment Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply
         risk  management   procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall   investment
         performance.  In  addition,  CAI also  provides  office space and other
         support services.  In consideration  for such services,  Multi-Strategy
         Series G will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee based on end of
         month  Members'  capital.  The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to
         its affiliates.

         Effective  August 1, 2005, the Board of Directors  approved a reduction
         in the  management  fee to  1.5% of net  assets  annually  (from  2.25%
         annually).

         In  addition,  CAI  allocated  certain  marketing  fees of  $21,514  to
         Multi-Strategy Series G during the year ended March 31, 2006.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement of Fund Shares. A placement agent affiliated with the Adviser
         will  generally be entitled to receive a fee from each  investor in the
         Company  whose  shares the agent  places.  The  specific  amount of the
         placement  fee paid with respect to a Member is generally  dependent on
         the size of the  investment in a Series.  Placement  agents may also be
         reimbursed  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  certain  out-of-pocket
         expenses.

         Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an  affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup,  Inc. serves as a placement agent
         of the  Multi-Strategy  Series G shares.  For the year ended  March 31,
         2006, CGM earned $194,725 in placement fees on Multi-Strategy  Series G
         shares.  Such fees are deducted from an investor's  gross  contribution
         amount.

         The Company has entered into  agreements  with third  parties to act as
         additional  placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy   Series  G  shares.
         Placement fees may range from 0 to 3%. In addition, the Adviser, and/or
         its affiliates,  will pay the placement  agents an annual fee,  payable
         monthly  in  arrears.  The fee  shall be paid  from the  Adviser's  own
         resources (or those of its affiliates).

         Prior to October 1, 2005 Multi-Strategy Series G paid CAI a monthly fee
         of 0.025%  (0.30% on an  annualized  basis)  for  administration  based
         primarily  upon average net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,
         and reimbursed certain expenses.  CAI, as Administrator,  retained PFPC
         Inc. ("PFPC"),  an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary
         of The PNC Financial  Services  Group,  to assist in the performance of
         its  administrative  duties. On October 1, 2005 a restructuring of this
         arrangement  took affect.  Under the new  arrangement CAI and PFPC have
         separate  agreements with the Company and act as  co-administrators  to
         the Company. CAI, as co-administrator, no longer receives a monthly fee
         for their administrative services to the Company. PFPC will continue to
         provide certain  accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services.  Fees for their  services  would be charged  directly  to the
         Company.

         Each  Director who is not an  "interested  person" of the  Company,  as
         defined by the 1940 Act,  receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus a
         fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of $1,000. Such Director fees
         are allocated to each series pro-rata, based on the relative net assets
         of each series.  Any Director  who is an  "interested  person" does not
         receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.  All  Directors  are
         reimbursed  for all reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total amounts
         expensed related to Directors by  Multi-Strategy  Series G for the year
         ended March 31, 2006 were $13,778.

         PFPC Trust  Company  (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as  custodian  of
         Multi-Strategy Series G's assets

     5.  CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

         Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for  shares may be
         accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized by
         the Board of  Directors  of the Company to accept or reject any initial
         and additional subscriptions for shares in Multi-Strategy Series G. The
         Board of Directors  from time to time and in its complete and exclusive
         discretion,   may  determine  to  cause  Multi-Strategy   Series  G  to
         repurchase  shares from Members  pursuant to written tenders by Members
         on such terms and conditions as it may  determine.  CAI expects that it
         typically  will  recommend to the Board of  Directors  that the Company
         offer to repurchase  shares from Members  quarterly,  on each March 31,
         June 30,  September  30 and  December 31 (or, if any such date is not a
         business day, on the immediately preceding business day).

         Net profits or net losses of Multi-Strategy Series G for each month-end
         will be allocated  among and credited to or debited against the capital
         accounts of all Members as of the last day of each month in  accordance
         with the Members' respective investment percentages for the month.

     7.  INCOME TAX INFORMATION

         The tax  components  of  capital  shown in the  table  below  represent
         distribution  requirements  the Fund  must  satisfy  under  income  tax
         regulations,  losses the Fund may be able to offset  against income and

         depreciation of securities and other investments for federal income tax
         purposes.

         Net  investment  income  (loss) and net realized gain (loss) may differ
         for financial  statement  and tax purposes.  The character of dividends
         and  distributions  made  during  the fiscal  year from net  investment
         income  or  net   realized   gains  may  differ  from  their   ultimate
         characterization  for federal income tax purposes.  Also, due to timing
         of dividends  and  distributions,  the fiscal year in which amounts are
         distributed  may differ from the fiscal year in which the income or net
         realized  gain was  recorded by the Fund.  Accordingly,  the  following
         amounts have been  reclassified  for March 31, 2006.  Net assets of the
         Fund were unaffected by the reclassifications.

         The  primary  difference  between  the  book  and tax  appreciation  or
         depreciation of Investment  Funds is attributable to adjustments to the
         tax  basis of  Investment  Funds  based on  allocation  of  income  and
         distributions   from  Investment  Funds  and  the  tax  realization  of
         financial statement  unrealized gain or loss. In addition,  the cost of
         Investment  Funds for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items
         of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment  Funds. The
         allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by each  Investment
         Fund on  Schedule  K-1.  The  aggregate  cost on  Investment  Funds for
         federal  income tax  purposes is  therefore  calculated  and  presented

         Under  provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the fund has elected to
         treat currency  losses  incurred  during the period November 1, 2005 to
         March 31, 2006 of $164,869 as having  incurred in the next fiscal year.
         These losses will be available to offset future realized gains, if any.

     8.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

         In June 2006,  the Board of  Directors is expected to approve a Plan of
         Merger and Reorganization under which the Multi-Strategy  Series M will
         merge into the Multi-Strategy Series G once the approval of the Members
         of Series M is obtained. Members of Series M will exchange their Series
         M shares for an  equivalent  value of Series G shares as of the date of
         the  merger.  The  proposed  merger  will be  accounted  for  as-if the
         respective  funds had pooled their assets and  liabilities.  Management
         expects  that should the Members of Series M approve the merger that it
         will occur during the fourth quarter of 2006.

COMMENTARY
================================================================================
Hedge fund strategies performed well in March, driven by long/short equity and
event driven strategies. Equity markets were strong globally, with Japan leading
the developed markets. Global fixed income markets sold off as the U.S. yield
curve steepened. Commodity prices advanced broadly. Global strategies were
mixed, as bond prices declined in anticipation of potential rate hikes.
Long/short equity strategies were positive due to powerful directional rallies
in industrials, materials and energy. Additionally, small-cap stocks continue to
outperform large-cap stocks. Event driven strategies were positive given the
favorable market environment for corporate activity. Distressed and performing
corporate credit strategies produced gains.

             -------------------------------------------------------

The Members and Board of Directors
Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC
- -Multi-Strategy Series M

We have  audited  the  accompanying  statement  of  assets  and  liabilities  of
Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge  Fund   Portfolios
LLC-Multi-Strategy Series M, including the schedule of investments,  as of March
31, 2006, and the related  statement of operations for the year then ended,  the
statements of changes in members'  capital for each of the years in the two-year
period then ended,  the statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and the
financial  highlights for each of the years in the three-year  period then ended
and the period from January 1, 2003  (commencement  of  operations) to March 31,
2003. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility
of the Fund's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included verification of
investments owned as of March 31, 2006, by inspection of investment subscription
documents and  confirmation  with  underlying  investment  funds.  An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by  management,   as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall   financial   statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  financial  position of
Citigroup   Alternative   Investments   Multi-Adviser   Hedge  Fund   Portfolios
LLC-Multi-Strategy  Series M as of March 31, 2006, the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended,  the changes in its members' capital
for each of the years in the  two-year  period  then  ended,  and the  financial
highlights  for each of the years in the  three-year  period  then ended and the
period from January 1, 2003 (commencement of operations)  through March 31, 2003
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC - MULTI-STRATEGY SERIES M


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.  ORGANIZATION

         Citigroup Alternative  Investments  Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
         LLC (the  "Company"  or "Fund")  was  organized  as a Delaware  Limited
         Liability  Company on August 16, 2002. The Company is registered  under
         the  Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as amended,  as a
         closed-end,  non-diversified management investment company. The Company
         is also registered  under the Securities Act of 1933 ("1933 Act").  The
         Company  consists of two separate series,  Multi-Strategy  Series M and
         Multi-Strategy  Series G (each a "Series").  The  financial  statements
         included  herein  are  for  Multi-Strategy  Series  M.  The  investment
         objective of Multi-Strategy Series M is to achieve capital appreciation
         principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment  Funds")
         managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
         employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
         strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
         short-side  positions to take  advantage  of  perceived  inefficiencies
         across  the  global  markets,   often  referred  to  as   "alternative"
         strategies.  Because Investment Funds following alternative  investment
         strategies are often described as hedge funds,  the investment  program
         of Multi-Strategy Series M can be described as a fund of hedge funds.

         Shares  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M are  sold to  eligible  investors
         (referred  to  as  "Members").   The  minimum  initial   investment  in
         Multi-Strategy  Series M from each  Member is $25,000  (and was $50,000
         from  January 1, 2003 to  November 1,  2003);  the  minimum  additional
         investment is $10,000.

         Citigroup  Alternative  Investments LLC ("CAI",  or the  "Adviser"),  a
         Delaware  limited   liability   company  and  indirect,   wholly  owned
         subsidiary  of  Citigroup  Inc.,  serves as  Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         investment adviser.  The Adviser is registered as an investment adviser
         under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and, among other
         things, is responsible for the allocation of Multi-Strategy  Series M's
         assets to various  Investment  Funds.  AMACAR  Partners,  Inc.  was the
         managing member of Multi-Strategy Series M prior to the conversion to a
         regulated  investment  company.  As  of  October  1,  2005,  under  the
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M's  governing  documents,   the  Company  has
         delegated  substantially all authority to oversee the management of the
         operations  and  assets  of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M to the  Board of
         Directors.

     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         Investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  of the
         respective limited  partnership  agreements,  limited liability company
         agreements and offering memoranda. Multi-Strategy Series M values these
         investments  at fair value  based on  financial  data  supplied  by the
         Investment Funds.

         A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The net asset value of Multi-Strategy  Series M is determined as of the
         close  of  business  at the end of each  month in  accordance  with the
         valuation  principles set forth below or as may be determined from time
         to time pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2006 (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Multi-Strategy  Series M's investments in Investment  Funds are carried
         at fair value as  determined  by  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's  pro-rata
         interest  in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
         utilize financial  information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
         net of management and performance  incentive fees or other  allocations
         payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the Investment
         Funds'  agreements.  Each  Investment  Manager  to  which  the  Adviser
         allocates assets will charge Multi-Strategy Series M, as investor in an
         underlying  Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the
         Investment Managers will receive performance-based  compensation in the
         form of an  incentive  fee.  The  asset-based  fees  of the  Investment
         Managers are generally  expected to range from 1% to 3% annually of the
         net assets under their  management  and the  incentive fee is generally
         expected to range from 15% to 25% of net profits annually.

         As a  general  matter,  the fair  value of  Multi-Strategy  Series  M's
         investment  in  an   Investment   Fund   represents   the  amount  that
         Multi-Strategy  Series  M can  reasonably  expect  to  receive  from an
         Investment Fund if  Multi-Strategy  Series M's investment were redeemed
         at the time of valuation,  based on information  available at the time.
         The  Investment  Funds  provide for periodic  redemptions  ranging from
         monthly to annually.  Investment Funds generally require advance notice
         of a Member's intent to redeem its interest,  and may, depending on the
         Investment  Funds'  governing  agreements,  deny or delay a  redemption
         request.  Multi-Strategy  Series M does not factor into its valuation a
         liquidity  discount  on  any  Investment  Funds  held.  The  underlying
         investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as
         described  in  each  Investment   Fund's  financial   statements.   The
         Investment  Funds may  invest a portion of their  assets in  restricted
         securities and other investments that are illiquid.

         B.   FUND EXPENSES

         Multi-Strategy  Series M bears all  expenses  incurred in the course of
         its operations, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
         and  expenses  related to  portfolio  transactions  and  positions  for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M's  account;   professional  fees;  costs  of
         insurance; registration expenses; and expenses of meetings of the Board
         of Directors.  Costs incurred in connection  with the initial  offering
         were deferred and amortized over the first twelve months of operations;
         costs incurred in connection with Multi-Strategy  Series M's subsequent
         registration  under the 1933 Act have been deferred and were  amortized
         over the twelve  months  commencing  after the  effective  date of such
         registration statement.

         C.   INCOME TAXES

         Multi-Strategy  Series  M  operated  as a  partnership  and  not  as an
         association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for
         U.S. federal income tax purposes from inception  through  September 30,
         2005.  As of  September  30,  2005,  Multi-Strategy  Series  M became a
         corporation that will be taxed as a regulated investment company.

         It is Multi-Strategy  Series M's policy to meet the requirements of the
         Internal Revenue Code

         applicable  to  regulated  investment  companies  (RIC) and  distribute
         substantially  all of its  taxable  net  investment  income and capital
         gains, if any, to shareholders each year. Therefore,  no federal income
         or excise tax provision is typically required for Multi-Strategy Series
         M's  financial  statements.  However,  during  fiscal  2006,  the  Fund
         incurred  $1,714 of excise tax which is  recognized  as a component  of
         Miscellaneous expenses. This expense was attributable to the conversion
         to RIC status.

         D.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,
         N.A. account that earn money market rates and are accounted for at cost
         plus accrued interest.

         E.   RECEIVABLE FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

         Receivable from investment funds of $35,972  represents  amounts due to
         Multi-Strategy  Series M for sales of its interests in Post Opportunity
         Fund,  L.P., and is expected to be received by the Fund upon completion
         of the Post Opportunity Fund's 2005 audit.

         F.   USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing Multi-Strategy Series M's financial
         statements are reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could
         differ from these estimates.

     3.  MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATIVE FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND
         OTHER

         CAI,  as  Adviser,   provides  certain  management  and  administrative
         services to Multi-Strategy Series M. CAI acts primarily to evaluate and
         select Investment Managers,  to allocate assets, to establish and apply
         risk  management   procedures,   and  to  monitor  overall   investment
         performance.  In  addition,  CAI also  provides  office space and other
         support services.  In consideration  for such services,  Multi-Strategy
         Series M will pay the Adviser a monthly  management fee based on end of
         month  Members'  capital.  The Adviser will pay a portion of the fee to
         its affiliates.

         Effective  August 1, 2005, the Board of Directors  approved a reduction
         in the  management  fee to  1.5% of net  assets  annually  (from  2.00%
         annually).

         In  addition,  CAI  allocated  certain  marketing  fees  of  $7,926  to
         Multi-Strategy Series M during the year ended March 31, 2006.

         Placement  agents  may be  retained  by the  Company  to  assist in the
         placement  of Fund  shares.  A  placement  agent  affiliated  with  the
         Adviser, will generally be entitled to receive a fee from each

         investor in the Company  whose  shares the agent  places.  The specific
         amount of the  placement fee paid with respect to a Member is generally
         dependent on the size of the investment in a Series.  Placement  agents
         may  also  be  reimbursed  by  the  Company  with  respect  to  certain
         out-of-pocket expenses.

         Citigroup  Global  Markets,  Inc.  ("CGM"),  an  affiliate of CAI and a
         wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup,  Inc. serves as a placement agent
         of the  Multi-Strategy  Series M shares.  For the year ended  March 31,
         2006, CGM earned $46,100 in placement fees on  Multi-Strategy  Series M
         shares.  Such fees are deducted from an investor's  gross  contribution
         amount.

         The Company has entered into  agreements  with third  parties to act as
         additional  placement  agents  for  Multi-Strategy   Series  M  shares.
         Placement fees may range from 0 to 3%. In addition, the Adviser, and/or
         its affiliates,  will pay the placement  agents an annual fee,  payable
         monthly  in  arrears.  The fee  shall be paid  from the  Adviser's  own
         resources (or those of its affiliates).

         Prior to October 1, 2005 Multi-Strategy Series M paid CAI a monthly fee
         of 0.025%  (0.30% on an  annualized  basis)  for  administration  based
         primarily  upon average net assets,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,
         and reimbursed certain expenses.  CAI, as Administrator,  retained PFPC
         Inc. ("PFPC"),  an independent third party and wholly-owned  subsidiary
         of The PNC Financial  Services  Group,  to assist in the performance of
         its  administrative  duties. On October 1, 2005 a restructuring of this
         arrangement  took affect.  Under the new  arrangement CAI and PFPC have
         separate  agreements with the Company and act as  co-administrators  to
         the Company. CAI, as co-administrator, no longer receives a monthly fee
         for their administrative services to the Company. PFPC will continue to
         provide certain  accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services.  Fees for their  services  would be charged  directly  to the
         Company.

         Each  Director who is not an  "interested  person" of the  Company,  as
         defined by the 1940 Act,  receives an annual retainer of $10,000 plus a
         fee per meeting of the Board of Directors of $1,000. Such Director fees
         are allocated to each series pro-rata, based on the relative net assets
         of each series.  Any Director  who is an  "interested  person" does not
         receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.  All  Directors  are
         reimbursed  for all reasonable  out of pocket  expenses.  Total amounts
         expensed related to Directors by  Multi-Strategy  Series M for the year
         ended March 31, 2006 were $5,087.

         PFPC Trust  Company  (an  affiliate  of PFPC)  serves as  custodian  of
         Multi-Strategy  Series M's assets and provides  custodial  services for
         Multi-Strategy   Series  M.  Fees   payable   to  the   custodian   and
         reimbursement for certain expenses are paid by Multi-Strategy Series M.

     4.  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         The  following  table lists the  aggregate  purchases and proceeds from
         sales of  Investment  Funds for the year ended March 31, 2006,  and net

         unrealized depreciation as of March 31, 2006.

     5.  CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND ALLOCATION OF INCOME

         Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscriptions  for  shares may be
         accepted as of the first day of each month.  CAI has been authorized by
         the Board of  Directors  of the Company to accept or reject any initial
         and additional subscriptions for shares in Multi-Strategy Series M. The
         Board of Directors  from time to time and in its complete and exclusive
         discretion may determine to cause Multi-Strategy Series M to repurchase
         shares  from  Members  pursuant  to written  tenders by Members on such
         terms and conditions as it may determine. CAI expects that it typically
         will  recommend  to the Board of  Directors  that the Company  offer to

         Net  investment  income  (loss) and net realized gain (loss) may differ
         for financial  statement  and tax purposes.  The character of dividends
         and  distributions  made  during  the fiscal  year from net  investment
         income  or  net   realized   gains  may  differ  from  their   ultimate
         characterization  for federal income tax purposes.  Also, due to timing
         of dividends  and  distributions,  the fiscal year in which amounts are
         distributed  may differ from the fiscal year in which the income or net
         realized  gain was  recorded by the Fund.  Accordingly,  the  following
         amounts have been  reclassified  for March 31, 2006.  Net assets of the
         Fund were unaffected by the reclassifications.

         The  primary  difference  between  the  book  and tax  appreciation  or
         depreciation of Investment  Funds is attributable to adjustments to the
         tax  basis of  Investment  Funds  based on  allocation  of  income  and
         distributions   from  Investment  Funds  and  the  tax  realization  of
         financial statement  unrealized gain or loss. In addition,  the cost of
         Investment  Funds for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items
         of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment  Funds. The
         allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by each  Investment
         Fund on  Schedule  K-1.  The  aggregate  cost on  Investment  Funds for
         federal  income tax  purposes is  therefore  calculated  and  presented
         annually as of March 31. The aggregate cost on Investment Funds and the

     8.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

         In June 2006,  the Board of  Directors is expected to approve a Plan of
         Merger and Reorganization under which the Multi-Strategy  Series M will
         merge into the Multi-Strategy Series G once the approval of the Members
         of Series M is obtained. Members of Series M will exchange their Series
         M shares for an  equivalent  value of Series G shares as of the date of
         the  merger.  The  proposed  merger  will be  accounted  for  as-if the
         respective  funds had pooled their assets and  liabilities.  Management
         expects  that should the Members of Series M approve the merger that it
         will occur during the fourth quarter of 2006.

       POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

       As shown in the table above,  Mr. Nolte is responsible for managing other
       accounts  ("Other  Accounts")  in  addition  to the  Series.  In  certain
       instances,  conflicts may arise in his  management of the Series and such
       Other Accounts.

       One situation  where a conflict may arise between the Series and an Other
       Account is in the allocation of investment opportunities among the Series
       and the Other Account.  For example, the Adviser may determine that there
       is an  opportunity  that is suitable  for the Series as well as for Other
       Accounts of the Adviser, which have a similar investment objective.  As a
       related matter,  a particular  Investment Fund interest or other security
       may be bought for one or more clients when one or more other  clients are
       selling that same security,  which may adversely  affect the Series.  The
       Company and the Adviser have adopted  policies and  procedures  regarding
       the allocation of investment opportunities,  which generally require that
       investment opportunities be allocated among the Series and Other Accounts
       in a manner that is fair,  equitable and consistent  with their fiduciary
       obligations to each.

       Mr. Nolte's management of the Series and Other Accounts may result in his
       devoting  a  disproportionate   amount  of  time  and  attention  to  the
       management of a particular account as against another.  This particularly
       may be the case when accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time
       horizons, asset levels and fees.

       The  management  of  personal  accounts  by Mr.  Nolte  may give  rise to
       potential conflicts of interest.  While the Adviser's code of ethics will
       impose  limits on the  ability  of Mr.  Nolte to trade  for his  personal
       account,  there is no assurance  that the  Adviser's  code of ethics will
       eliminate such conflicts.

       Other than the conflicts described above, the Company is not aware of any
       material  conflicts  that may  arise  in  connection  with the  Adviser's
       management of the Series' investments and such Other Accounts.

(A)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS

       Mr. Nolte's compensation is a combination of salary, discretionary bonus,
       deferred compensation, retirement plans and automatic participation in a
       company-funded retirement bonus. The discretionary bonus is based upon
       the financial results and profitability of Citigroup as a whole, that of
       CAI as a whole, and that of CAI's Global Fund of Funds business unit, for
       which Mr. Nolte serves as chief executive. The discretionary bonus is not
       linked to the performance of any specific benchmark or that of any CAI
       investment fund or account; nor are specific asset size targets
       considered.

                                   (POLICY 27)

                CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR
                               FINANCIAL OFFICERS



I.   COVERED OFFICERS, PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This  Code of  Ethics  (the  "Code")  for the  Fund  applies  to its  Chief
     Executive  Officer,  President,  Chief Financial  Officer and Treasurer (or
     persons  performing  similar  functions)  (as of August 2005,  Ray Nolte as
     President and Jennifer Magro as Treasurer;  each, a "Covered  Officer") for
     the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships.

     o    full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in other  public  communications
          made by the Fund;

     o    compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

     o    prompt internal  reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each  Covered  Officer should  adhere to a high  standard  of business
ethics and should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent  conflicts of interest.  Any question about the  application of
the Code should be referred to the Fund's Chief Legal Officer  (initially Millie
Kim, General Counsel of the Fund's investment adviser).

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD  HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND  APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes,  or appears to interfere,  with the interests of, or his or
her service to, the Fund.  For example,  a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer,  or a member of his or her family,  receives  improper personal
benefits as a result of his or her position with the Fund.(1)


- ------------------------------------
(1) Because conflicts of interest may arise as a result of family relationships,
each Covered Officer should consider such potential conflicts and, if
appropriate, familiarize his or her family members with the Covered Officer's
relevant obligations under this Code.

                                       1
<PAGE>
                                                                       S&S DRAFT

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company Act") and
the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940  ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions  (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other  property)  with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated  persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its  investment  adviser's  compliance  programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures,  and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code,  unless or until the Chief Legal Officer  determines any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts  may  arise  from,  or  as  a  result  of,  the  contractual
relationship  between the Fund and its  investment  adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees.  As a result, this Code recognizes that
the  Covered  Officers  will,  in the  normal  course of their  duties  (whether
formally  for  the  Fund  or for the  adviser,  or for  both),  be  involved  in
establishing  policies  and  implementing  decisions  that will  have  different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual  relationship between
the Fund and the adviser and is consistent  with the  performance by the Covered
Officers  of their  duties  as  officers  of the Fund.  Thus,  if  performed  in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically.  In
addition,  it is recognized by the Fund's Board of Directors  ("Board") that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of conflicts of
interest  under the Code,  but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these
examples  are not  exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the personal
interest  of a Covered  Officer  should  not be  placed  improperly  before  the
interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o    use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly
          to influence  investment  decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered  Officer  would  benefit  personally  (directly or
          indirectly) to the detriment of the Fund;

     o    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the (direct
          or indirect) individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather
          than the benefit of the Fund; or

     o    use material  non-public  knowledge of portfolio  transactions made or
          contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
          personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

<PAGE>
                                                                       S&S DRAFT

     Each Covered  Officer  must,  at the time of signing this Code,  report all
affiliations  and significant  business  interests  outside the Citigroup,  Inc.
corporate group and must update the report annually.

     Conflict  of  interest  situations  should  always be approved by the Chief
Legal Officer and, if material,  be communicated to the relevant Fund's Board of
Directors. Examples of these include:

     o    service as a director on the board of any company;

     o    accepting directly or indirectly,  anything of value,  including gifts
          and  gratuities  in excess of $100 per year from any  person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings,  not
          including occasional meals or tickets to theatre or sporting events or
          other  similar   entertainment,   provided  it  is   business-related,
          reasonable  in  cost,  appropriate  as to time and  place,  and not so
          frequent as to raise any question of impropriety.

     o    any   ownership   interest  in,  or  any   consulting   or  employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment  adviser,  principal  placement  agent/underwriter,  or any
          affiliated person thereof;

     o    a direct or indirect  financial  interest in commissions,  transaction
          charges  or  spreads  paid  by  the  Fund  for   effecting   portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o    Each Covered  Officer should  familiarize  himself or herself with the
          disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

     o    each  Covered  Officer  should not  knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause
          others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within
          or outside the Fund,  including to the Fund's  Directors and auditors,
          and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o    each Covered Officer should, to the extent  appropriate  within his or
          her area of responsibility,  consult with other officers and employees
          of the Fund and its adviser  with the goal of  promoting  full,  fair,
          accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure  in the  reports and
          documents  the Fund files  with,  or submits  to, the SEC and in other
          public communications made by the Fund; and

     o    it is the  responsibility  of each Covered  Officer to use  reasonable
          efforts to promote  compliance  with the  standards  and  restrictions
          imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

                                                                       S&S DRAFT

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     o    upon adoption of the Code  (thereafter as applicable,  upon becoming a
          Covered  Officer),  affirm in  writing to the Board that he or she has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     o    annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he or she has  complied
          with the requirements of the Code;

     o    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Fund or its  affiliated  persons for reports of  potential  violations
          that are made in good faith; and

     o    notify  the Chief  Legal  Officer  promptly  if he or she knows of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

     The Chief Legal Officer is  responsible  for applying this Code to specific
situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the authority to
interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  However,  any  explicit  or
implicit  waivers(2) sought by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Audit
Committee of the relevant Fund as described below.

     The Fund will follow these procedures in  investigating  and enforcing this
Code:

     o    the Chief Legal Officer will take  appropriate  action to  investigate
          any potential violations reported to him or her;

     o    if, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer believes that no
          violation  has  occurred,  the Chief Legal  Officer is not required to
          take any further action,  but will meet with the person  reporting the
          violation  for the purpose of informing  such person of the reason for
          not taking action;

     o    any matter that the Chief Legal Officer  believes is a violation  will
          be reported to the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board;

     o    if the Audit  Committee  concurs that a violation has  occurred,  they
          will consider  appropriate  action,  which may include  review of, and
          appropriate  modifications  to,  applicable  policies and  procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
          board;  or a  recommendation  to  dismiss  the  Covered  Officer as an
          officer of the Fund;

     o    the Audit  Committee  will be  responsible  for granting  waivers,  as
          appropriate,   provided  that  waivers  will  be  considered  only  if
          supported by a written request on

- -------------------------------------

(2) Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
a material departure form a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver" as "the registrant's failure to take action within a reasonable period
of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics
that has been made known to an executive officer" of the registrant.

                                       4
<PAGE>
                                                                       S&S DRAFT

          behalf of the relevant  Covered Officer  explaining the basis for such
          request  and how the waiver  may be  implemented  consistent  with the
          principles underlying this Code; and

     o    any changes to or waivers of this Code will,  to the extent  required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

     The Audit  Committee,  in determining  whether waivers should be granted or
whether  violations  have occurred,  and the Chief Legal  Officer,  in rendering
decisions  and  interpretations  and in conducting  investigations  of potential
violations  under the Code,  may, at their  discretion,  consult with such other
persons as they  determine  to be  appropriate,  including,  but not limited to,
another  senior  legal  officer  of the Fund or its  investment  adviser  or its
affiliates,  counsel to the Fund or its  investment  adviser or such  affiliate,
counsel to the  Independent  Directors,  or (subject to applicable  pre-approval
requirements) independent auditors or other consultants



V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes
of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  and the  rules  and  forms
applicable  to  registered  investment  companies  thereunder.  Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Fund,  the Fund's  investment  adviser,  principal
placement  agent/underwriter,  or other service  providers  govern or purport to
govern the  behavior or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to
this Code,  they are  superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or
conflict  with the  provisions  of this Code,  unless any provision of this Code
conflicts  with  any  applicable  federal  or  state  law,  in  which  case  the
requirements  of such law will govern.  The Fund's and its investment  adviser's
and principal  placement  agent/underwriter's  codes of ethics under 17j-1 under
the  Investment  Company  Act are  separate  requirements  that may apply to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by a majority vote
of the Board, including a majority of Independent Directors.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent  Directors and their counsel, the
Fund and its  counsel  and the  investment  adviser  and its  counsel  (and,  as
relevant,  any other person described in the last paragraph under "Reporting and
Accountability" above).

VIII.  INTERNAL USE

       The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute  an  admission,  by or on  behalf  of  the  Fund,  as  to  any  fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I  have  read  and   understand   the  terms  of  the  Code.  I  recognize   the
responsibilities  and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the Code.

      periods presented in this report;

4.    The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
      establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (as

      internal  control over  financial  reporting  (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)

      (a)   Designed such  disclosure  controls and  procedures,  or caused such
            disclosure   controls  and  procedures  to  be  designed  under  our
            supervision,  to ensure that  material  information  relating to the
            registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries,  is made known

            materially  affected,  or is reasonably likely to materially affect,

      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of

            reasonably  likely to adversely affect the  registrant's  ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      (b)   Any fraud,  whether or not  material,  that  involves  management or
            other  employees  who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's

I, Jennifer Magro, certify that:

1.    I have  reviewed  this  report  on Form  N-CSR  of  Citigroup  Alternative
      Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC;

2.    Based on my knowledge,  this report does not contain any untrue  statement
      of a material fact or omit to state a material fact  necessary to make the
      statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
      were made,  not  misleading  with  respect  to the period  covered by this
      report;

3.    Based on my  knowledge,  the  financial  statements,  and other  financial
      information  included  in this  report,  fairly  present  in all  material
      respects the financial  condition,  results of operations,  changes in net
      assets,  and cash  flows (if the  financial  statements  are  required  to
      include a statement of cash flows) of the  registrant  as of, and for, the
      periods presented in this report;

4.    The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
      establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  (as
      defined in Rule  30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940) and
      internal  control over  financial  reporting  (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)
      under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

      (a)   Designed such  disclosure  controls and  procedures,  or caused such
            disclosure   controls  and  procedures  to  be  designed  under  our
            supervision,  to ensure that  material  information  relating to the
            registrant,  including its consolidated subsidiaries,  is made known
            to us by others  within  those  entities,  particularly  during  the
            period in which this report is being prepared;

      (b)   Designed such internal control over financial  reporting,  or caused
            such internal control over financial  reporting to be designed under
            our  supervision,  to provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  the
            reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation of financial
            statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally
            accepted accounting principles;

      (c)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's  disclosure controls
            and  procedures and presented in this report our  conclusions  about
            the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
            date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on
            such evaluation; and

<PAGE>

      (d)   Disclosed  in this  report any change in the  registrant's  internal
            control over  financial  reporting  that occurred  during the second
            fiscal  quarter  of the  period  covered  by this  report  that  has
            materially  affected,  or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
            the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.    The registrant's  other certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
      registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
      directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      (a)   All significant  deficiencies and material  weaknesses in the design
            or operation of internal control over financial  reporting which are
            reasonably  likely to adversely affect the  registrant's  ability to
            record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      (b)   Any fraud,  whether or not  material,  that  involves  management or
            other  employees  who have a  significant  role in the  registrant's
            internal control over financial reporting.
