1.   ORGANIZATION

     UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited liability
     company under the laws of Delaware on August 13, 2001 and commenced
     operations on February 1, 2003. The Fund is registered under the Investment
     Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,
     non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund's investment
     objective is to seek capital appreciation over the long-term. The Fund is a
     multi-manager fund that seeks to achieve its objective by deploying its
     assets among a select group of portfolio managers who primarily employ
     long/short equity strategies, including those involving foreign issuers.
     Generally, such portfolio managers conduct their investment programs
     through unregistered investment funds (collectively, the "Investment
     Funds"), in which the Fund invests as a limited partner, member or
     shareholder along with other investors.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall responsibility
     to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund, including the
     exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies regarding the
     management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business. The Directors
     have engaged UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. ("UBSFA", the "Adviser" and, when
     providing services under the Administration Agreement, the
     "Administrator"), a Delaware limited liability company, to provide
     investment advice regarding the selection of Investment Funds and to be
     responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc., which is a
     wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS AG, and is registered as an investment
     adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Directors may determine and are generally
     accepted monthly. The Directors reserve the right to reject any application
     for interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to
     written tenders to Members. These repurchases will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their complete
     and exclusive discretion. Members can only transfer or assign their
     membership interests or a portion thereof (i) by operation of law pursuant
     to the death, bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii)
     with the written approval of the Directors, which may be withheld in their
     sole and absolute discretion. Such transfers may be made even if the
     balance of the capital account to such transferee is equal to or less than
     the transferor's initial capital contribution.

2.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     new guidance to improve disclosures about fair value measurement. This new
     guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements regarding (i) the level
     of disaggregation for which fair value measurement disclosures should be
     provided, and (ii) the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair
     value for measurements that fall within either Level 2 or Level 3 of the
     fair value hierarchy. It also requires disclosure of significant transfers
     into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 measurements in the fair value
     hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers, as well as the reasons for
     all transfers into and out of Level 3. This guidance is effective for
     interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The
     Fund has adopted this accounting guidance for the period ended June 30,
     2010, which has not had a material impact on the Fund's members' capital or
     results of operations. The guidance also requires entities to separately
     present purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in their
     reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements (i.e. to present such
     items as gross basis rather than on a net basis), which are effective for
     fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods
     within those fiscal years. Adoption of this accounting guidance is
     currently being assessed but is not expected to have a material impact on
     the Fund's members' capital or results of operations.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The Fund values its investments at fair value, in accordance with U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which is the price that
     would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
     orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

     Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of the Fund's
     investments which are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

     LEVEL 1-- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     LEVEL 2-- fair value of investments in Investment Funds with the ability to
     redeem at net asset value as of the measurement date, or within one quarter
     of the measurement date

     LEVEL 3-- fair value of investments in Investment Funds that do not have
     the ability to redeem at net asset value within one quarter of the
     measurement date

     The Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at
     the end of the reporting period. All transfers into and out of Level 3 can
     be found in the Level 3 reconciliation table. There were no transfers
     between Level 1 and Level 2.

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
                                                                     (UNAUDITED)

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2010

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     GAAP provides guidance in determining whether there has been a significant
     decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
     compared with normal market activity for such asset or liability (or
     similar assets or liabilities). GAAP also provides guidance on identifying
     circumstances that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or
     liability is not orderly. In its consideration, the Fund must consider
     inputs and valuation techniques used for each class of assets and
     liabilities. Judgment is used to determine the appropriate classes of
     assets and liabilities for which disclosures about fair value measurements
     are provided. Fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets
     and liabilities requires greater disaggregation than the Fund's line items
     in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital. The Fund
     determines the appropriate classes for those disclosures on the basis of
     the nature and risks of the assets and liabilities and their classification
     in the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Levels 1, 2, and 3).

     For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
     during the period, the Fund provides quantitative disclosures about the
     fair value measurements separately for each class of assets and
     liabilities, as well as a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances
     of Level 3 assets and liabilities broken down by class.

     The following is a summary of the investment strategy and any restrictions
     on the liquidity provisions of the investments in Investment Funds held in
     the Fund as of June 30, 2010. Investment Funds with no current redemption
     restrictions may be subject to future gates, lock-up provisions or other
     restrictions, in accordance with their offering documents. The Fund had no
     unfunded capital commitments as of June 30, 2010.

     The Investment Funds in the long/short equity strategy invest in both long
     and short equity strategies that are primarily in US common stocks. The
     management of these Investment Funds has the ability to shift investments
     from value to growth strategies, from small to large capitalization common
     stocks, and from a net long position to a net short position. Investment
     Funds within this strategy are generally subject to a 15 - 125 day
     redemption notice period. Investment Funds representing approximately 3
     percent of fair value are side pockets or liquidating trusts where the
     liquidation of assets is expected over the next 24 months. The remaining
     approximately 97 percent of the Investment Funds have either initial
     redemption dates commencing in the future (4 percent) or are available to
     be redeemed with no restrictions (93 percent), subject to the Investment
     Funds' liquidity terms, as of the measurement date. One Investment Fund,
     with a fair value of $38,733,945, transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 at
     June 30, 2010. In addition, two Investment Funds, with a fair value of
     $22,121,513, transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 at June 30, 2010.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     A detailed depiction of each investment in the portfolio by investment
     strategy, including any additional liquidity terms and other restrictions,
     as well as a breakdown of the portfolio into the fair value measurement
     levels, can be found in the tables within the Schedule of Portfolio
     Investments.

     Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
     Adviser as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal period in
     accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be
     determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the
     Directors. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are subject to the
     terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and offering
     memorandums, as appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
     carried at fair value. All valuations utilize financial information
     supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management and performance
     incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers or
     pursuant to the Investment Funds' agreements. The Fund's valuation
     procedures require the Adviser to consider all relevant information
     available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. The Adviser has
     assessed factors including, but not limited to the individual Investment
     Funds' compliance with fair value measurements, price transparency and
     valuation procedures in place, subscription and redemption activity, level
     of illiquid securities held, and the existence or absence of certain
     redemption restrictions. The Adviser and/or the Directors will consider
     such information and consider whether it is appropriate, in light of all
     relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value as
     reported or whether to adjust such value. The underlying investments of
     each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as described in each
     Investment Fund's financial statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio
     Investments).

     The fair value relating to certain underlying investments of these
     Investment Funds, for which there is no ready market, has been estimated by
     the respective Investment Funds' management and is based upon available
     information in the absence of readily ascertainable fair values and does
     not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Due to
     the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated fair values may
     differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
     market for the investments existed. These differences could be material.

     Complete information about the Investment Funds' underlying investments is
     not readily available. Therefore it is unknown on an aggregate basis
     whether the Investment Funds held any investments whereby the Fund's
     proportionate share exceeded 5% of the Fund's net assets at June 30, 2010.

     The fair value of the Fund's assets and liabilities which qualify as
     financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented in the
     Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2010

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     B.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

     The Fund accounts for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund
     transactions based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of the
     underlying investment at the date of redemption. Interest income and
     expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.

     C.   FUND EXPENSES

     The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not
     limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting
     and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value; costs of insurance; registration expenses; interest expense;
     offering and organization costs; due diligence, including travel and
     related expenses; expenses of meetings of Directors; all costs with respect
     to communications to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the
     Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Fund has reclassified $5,835,245 and $8,961,336 from accumulated net
     investment loss and accumulated net realized gain from investments,
     respectively, to net capital contributions during the six month period
     ended June 30, 2010. The reclassification was to reflect, as an adjustment
     to net contributions, the amount of estimated taxable income or loss that
     have been allocated to the Fund's Members as of June 30, 2010 and had no
     effect on members' capital.

     The Fund files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
     applicable states. Management has analyzed the Fund's tax positions taken
     on its federal and state income tax returns for all open tax years, and has
     concluded that no provision for federal or state income tax is required in
     the Fund's financial statements. The Fund's federal and state income tax
     returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have
     not expired are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and
     state departments of revenue. The Fund recognizes interest and penalties,
     if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the
     Statement of Operations. During the period ended June 30, 2010, the Fund
     did not incur any interest or penalties.

     Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return its
     distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank, NA
     account which pays money market rates and are accounted for at cost plus
     accrued interest which is included in interest

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (CONTINUED)

     receivable on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.
     Such cash, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Fund has not
     experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed
     to any significant credit risk on such accounts.

     F.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
     management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
     amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
     liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
     amounts of increases and decreases in members' capital from operations
     during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
     estimates.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
     an Investment Management Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the Fund
     pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the "Investment Management Fee") at the
     annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund's members' capital, excluding the capital
     account attributable to the Adviser.

     The Administrator provides certain administrative services to the Fund,
     including, among other things, providing office space and other support
     services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays the
     Administrator a monthly fee (the "Management Fee") at an annual rate of
     0.30% of the Fund's members' capital, excluding the capital account
     attributable to the Adviser. The Management Fee and the Investment
     Management Fee will be paid to the Adviser out of the Fund's assets and
     debited against the Members' capital accounts, excluding the capital
     account attributable to the Adviser. A portion of the Investment Management
     Fee and the Management Fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

     UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS
     Americas, Inc., acts as a placement agent for the Fund, without special
     compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated with its
     activities as placement agent. Placement fees, if any, charged on
     contributions are debited against the contribution amounts, to arrive at a
     net subscription amount. The placement fee does not constitute assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase or decrease in members' capital derived from operations
     (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of all Members on
     a pro-rata basis, other than the Investment Management Fee and the
     Management Fee which are similarly allocated to all Members other than the
     Adviser or Administrator as described above.

     Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors each receive an
     additional annual retainer in the amounts of $10,000 and $15,000,
     respectively. These additional annual retainer amounts are paid for by the
     Fund on a pro-rata basis with ten other UBS funds where UBSFA is the
     investment adviser. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for all
     reasonable out of pocket expenses.

     Other investment partnerships sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
     may also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

5.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

     PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.), Inc. ("PNC"), a member of The PNC
     Financial Services Group, Inc., serves as administrative and accounting
     agent to the Fund, and in that capacity provides certain administrative,
     accounting, record keeping, tax and Member related services. PNC receives a
     monthly fee primarily based upon (i) the average members' capital of the
     Fund subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii) the aggregate members'
     capital of the Fund and certain other investment funds sponsored or advised
     by UBS Americas, Inc. or its affiliates. Additionally, the Fund reimburses
     certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PNC.

     PFPC Trust Company provides custodial services for the Fund.

6.   INVESTMENTS

     As of June 30, 2010, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none of
     which were related parties.

     Aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of investments for the period
     from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2010 amounted to $42,500,000 and
     $102,793,689, respectively.

     The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment Funds.
     The allocated taxable income is reported to the Fund by the Investment
     Funds on Schedule K-1. The tax basis of investments for 2010 will not be
     finalized by the Fund until after the fiscal year end.

     The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for
     compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management
     fees of 1.00% to 2.00% (per annum) of net assets and performance incentive
     fees and allocations ranging from 16.50% to 25.00% of net profits earned.

7.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
     invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
     investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
     not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
     contracts for differences, and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in
     these Investment Funds is limited to the fair value of these investments.

8.   INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Fund.
     Based on its history and experience, the Fund believes that the likelihood
     of such an event is remote.

9.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     As of June 30, 2010, the Fund had $60,807,710 of withdrawals payable. On
     July 22, 2010, the Fund paid $55,249,325. The remaining amount payable of

     Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. changed its name to BNY Mellon Investment
     Servicing (US) Inc. PFPC Trust Company will not change its name until a
     later date to be announced.

The following is a summary of the inputs used in valuing the Fund's investments
at fair value. The inputs or methodology used for valuing the Fund's investments
are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those
investments. The Fund's valuation procedures require evaluation of all relevant
factors available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. These relevant
factors include the individual Investment Funds' compliance with fair value
measurements, price transparency and valuation procedures in place, subscription
and redemption activity, level of illiquid securities held, and the existence or
absence of redemption restrictions.

The Fund's investments are categorized in three levels as disclosed below. Level
1 discloses the amount of investments where the values of those investments are
based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2
discloses the amount of investments where the Fund has the ability to redeem at
net asset value as of the June 30, 2010 measurement date, or within one quarter
of the measurement date. Level 3 discloses the amount of investments where the
Fund does not have the ability to redeem at net asset value within one quarter
of the June 30, 2010 measurement date.

liabilities still held as of June 30, 2010 is $(3,588,806).
