1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited
liability company on April 6, 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware and
is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as a
closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund's
investment objective is to generate consistent capital appreciation over the
long term, with relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional
equity and fixed-income markets. The Fund will seek to accomplish this objective
by allocating its assets primarily among professionally selected investment
funds ("Investment Funds") that are managed by experienced third-party
investment advisers ("Portfolio Managers") who invest in a variety of markets
and employ, as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies.

J.P. Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc. (the "Investment Manager"), a
corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware and an affiliate of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase"), is responsible for the allocation of
assets to various Investment Funds, subject to policies adopted by the Board of
Directors (the "Board"). Ehrlich Associates, L.L.C., a limited liability company
formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Managing Member"), serves
as the managing member of the Fund. The Managing Member is registered as a
commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").

CMRCC, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of New York and an
affiliate of the Investment Manager, is the special member of the Fund (the
"Special Member"). The Special Member is entitled to all incentive-based
performance allocations, if any, from Members' accounts.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
Investment Manager as of the last day of each month in accordance with the
valuation principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time
pursuant to policies established by the Board. The Fund's investments in the
Investment Funds are considered to be illiquid and can only be redeemed
periodically. The Board has approved procedures pursuant to which the Fund
values its investments in Investment Funds at fair value. In accordance with
these procedures, fair value as of each month-end ordinarily is the value
determined as of such month-end for each Investment Fund in accordance with the
Investment Fund's valuation policies and reported at the time of the Fund's
valuation.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund
represents the amount that the Fund could reasonably expect to receive from an
Investment Fund if the Fund's interest were redeemed at the time of the
valuation, based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation
is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. In the unlikely event that an
Investment Fund does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis,
the Fund would determine the fair value of such Investment Fund based on the
most recent value reported by the Investment Fund, as well any other relevant
information available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. The values
assigned to these investments are based on available information and do not
necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as such amounts
depend on future circumstances and cannot reasonably be determined until the
individual investments are actually liquidated. However, because of the inherent
uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ significantly from
the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments
existed, and the differences could be significant.

Investments in Investment Funds with a value of $181,463,780, which is
approximately 95.32% of the Fund's net assets at September 30, 2008, have been
fair valued and are illiquid and restricted as to resale or transfer.

Some of the Investment Funds may invest all or a portion of their assets in
investments which may be illiquid. Some of these investments are held in
so-called "side pockets", sub funds within the Investment Funds, which provide
for their separate liquidation potentially over a much longer period than the
liquidity an investment in the Investment Funds may provide. Should the Fund
seek to liquidate its investment in an Investment Fund which maintains
investments in a side pocket arrangement or which holds substantially all of its
assets in illiquid securities, the Fund might not be able to fully liquidate its
investment without delay, which could be considerable. In such cases, during the
period until the Fund is permitted to fully liquidate its interest in the
Investment Funds, the value of its investment could fluctuate.

In September 2006, the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 -
Fair Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. SFAS 157 requires disclosure surrounding the various
inputs that are used in determining the value of the Fund's investments. These
inputs are summarized into the three broad levels listed below.

     --   Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     --   Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit
          risk, etc.)

     --   Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

C. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received, whether in the form of cash or securities, are applied
as a reduction of the investment's cost when identified by the Investment Fund
as a return of capital. Once the investment's cost is received, any further
distributions are recognized as realized gains.

D. INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Dividend income is recorded on
the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses from Investment Fund
transactions are calculated on the identified cost basis. Investments are
recorded on the effective date of the subscription in the Investment Fund. All
changes in the value of the Investment Funds are included as unrealized
appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of Operations.

E. FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business other than those that the
Investment Manager assumes. The expenses of the Fund include, but are not
limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to investment
transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting and
auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; expenses of meetings of the Board and
Members; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and other types of
expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a partnership for
Federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision for the payment of
Federal, state or local income taxes has been provided. Each Member is
individually required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of
the Fund's taxable income or loss.

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.
48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an Interpretation of FASB
Statement No. 109" (the "Interpretation"). The Interpretation establishes for
all entities, including pass-through entities such as the Fund, a minimum
threshold for financial statement recognition of the benefit of positions taken
in filing tax returns (including whether an entity is taxable in a particular
jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. The Interpretation
is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the date of effectiveness.

Based on its analysis, the Fund has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 did
not have a material impact to the Fund's financial statements upon adoption.
However, the Fund's conclusion regarding FIN 48 may be subject to review and
adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to,
further implementation guidance expected from the FASB, and on-going analysis of
tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

G. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies on deposit at PNC Bank, N.A.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Investment Manager provides advisory and other services. In consideration
for such management services, the Fund pays the Investment Manager a monthly
management fee equal to 0.1042% (approximately 1.25% on an annualized basis) and
an additional administrative services fee of 0.0125% per month (0.15% on an
annualized basis) of end of month Members' Capital.

Prior to April 1, 2006 the Fund paid the Investment Manager a monthly management
fee equal to 0.125% (1.50% on an annualized basis) and an additional
administrative services fee of 0.0125% per month (0.15% on an annualized basis)
of end of month Members' Capital.

The Fund and the Investment Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation and
Reimbursement Agreement (the "Expense Limitation Agreement"), dated May 26,
2004, under which the Investment Manager will agree to waive its fees and, if
necessary, reimburse expenses in respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that
the Agreement is in place so that the total operating expenses of the Fund
(excluding interest, brokerage commissions, other transaction-related expenses
and any extraordinary expenses of the Fund as well as any Incentive Allocation)
do not exceed 2.30% on an annualized basis of the Fund's net assets as of the
end of each month. Under the Expense Limitation Agreement, any waivers or
reimbursements made by the Investment Manager will be subject to repayment by
the Fund within three years of the end of the fiscal year in which the waiver or
reimbursement is made, provided that repayment does not result in the Fund's
aggregate operating expenses exceeding the foregoing expense limitations. For
the six months ended September 30, 2008, the Funds' operating expenses did not
exceed the expense limitation. The Fund did not reimburse the Investment
Manager, and the Investment Manager did not pay for any expenses on the Fund's
behalf.

The Fund has entered into an administration agreement with PNC Global Investment
Servicing, Inc. ("PNC"), formerly known as PFPC Inc., whereby PNC provides fund
accounting, investor services and transfer agency functions for the Fund. As
compensation for services set forth herein that are rendered by PNC during the
term of this Agreement, the Fund pays PNC an annual fee ranging from 0.035% to
0.075% of the Fund's average net assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $6,250
for administration and accounting, an annual fee of 0.015% of the Fund's average
net assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $3,334 for regulatory administration
services, and an annual fee for Member services of $150 per Member, with a
minimum monthly fee of $1,000. For the six months ended September 30, 2008,
administration fees totaled $135,178, of which none were waived.

PFPC Trust Company ("PFPC Trust") serves as custodian of the Fund's assets and
provides custodial services to the Fund. As compensation for services, the Fund
pays PFPC Trust an annual fee of 0.005% of the Fund's average gross assets, with
a minimum monthly fee of $795.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The Independent Directors are each paid an annual retainer of $10,000 plus
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in consideration for their attendance at
meetings of the Board, and any committees thereof, and other services they may
provide to the Fund.

4. LINE OF CREDIT

From time to time, the Fund may borrow cash from a major institution under a
credit agreement up to a maximum of $8 million. Interest is payable on any
outstanding balance at PRIME plus Margin (0%) or LIBOR plus Margin (0.85%).
During the six months ended September 30, 2008, there were no borrowings, and
there was no loan payable outstanding on September 30, 2008. Credit facility
fees incurred for the six months ended September 30, 2008 amounted to $8,000.

5. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate purchases and sales of Investment Funds for the six months ended
September 30, 2008 amounted to $66,300,190 and $8,074,872, respectively.

At September 30, 2008, the estimated cost of investments for Federal income tax
purposes was substantially the same as the cost for financial reporting
purposes. Accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation on investments was
$17,136,654 and gross unrealized depreciation was $12,491,891, resulting in net
unrealized appreciation of $4,644,763.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION

Generally, initial and additional subscription for interests by eligible
investors may be accepted at such times as the Fund may determine. The Fund
reserves the right to reject any subscriptions for interests in the Fund. The
initial acceptance for subscriptions for Interests was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial Closing Date"). After the Initial Closing Date, the Fund generally
accepts subscriptions for interests as of the first day of each month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
tenders by members. These repurchases will be made at such times, and in such
amounts, and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole
discretion. The Investment Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Interests from members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets quarterly, effective as of the last day of
March, June, September, and December. A 1.5% repurchase fee payable to the Fund
will be charged for repurchases of Members' Interests at any time prior to the
day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of a Member's purchase of its
Interests. For the six months ended September 30, 2008, the fund did not charge
repurchase fees to any Member.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

At the end of each Allocation Period of the Fund, any net capital appreciation
or net capital depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized), as the
case may be, is allocated to the capital accounts of all of the Members
(including the Special Member and the Managing Member) in proportion to their
respective opening capital account balances for such Allocation Period. The
initial "Allocation Period" began on the Initial Closing Date, with each
subsequent Allocation Period beginning immediately after the close of the
preceding Allocation Period. Each Allocation Period closes on the first to occur
of (1) the last day of each month, (2) the date immediately prior to the
effective date of (a) the admission of a new Member or (b) an increase in a
Member's capital contribution, (3) the effective date of any repurchase of
Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

At the end of each calendar year, each Member's return on investment for the
year is determined and a portion of the net capital appreciation allocated to
each Member's capital account during the year (the "Performance Allocation"),
net of the Member's allocable share of the Management Fee and the Manager
Administrative Services Fee, equal to 10% of the portion of such net capital
appreciation that exceeds the Preferred Return (as defined below) will be
reallocated to the capital account of the Special Member. The "Preferred Return"
is equal to the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield (as defined below) for each
month during the relevant calendar year (or any shorter period of calculation).
The "3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield" for any month shall equal one-twelfth of
the annual yield for the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill for the first business day
of the then current calendar quarter as set forth in the U.S. Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities",
or if such measurement is not available, such other source as the Managing
Member may determine appropriate in its discretion.

Prior to April 1, 2005 the performance allocation was calculated in the
following manner: (1) net capital appreciation up to a 6% return remains
allocated to each Member (the "Preferred Return"); (2) net capital appreciation
in excess of the Preferred Return is reallocated to the Special Member until it
has been allocated the next 0.30% of return (the "Catch-Up"); and (3)
thereafter, 95% of any net capital appreciation in excess of the Preferred
Return plus the Catch-Up remains allocated to such Member, and the remaining 5%
of such net capital appreciation is reallocated to the Special Member.

No Performance Allocation is made, however, with respect to a Member's capital
account until any cumulative net capital depreciation previously allocated to
such Member's capital account plus any Management Fees and Manager
Administrative Service Fees charged to such capital account (the "Loss
Carryforward") have been recovered. Any Loss Carryforward of a Member is reduced
proportionately to reflect the repurchase of any portion of that Member's
Interest. Upon a repurchase of an Interest (other than at the end of a calendar
year) from a Member, a Performance Allocation will be determined and allocated
to the Special Member, and in the case of any repurchase of a partial Interest,
on a "first in - first out" basis (i.e., the portion of the Interest being
repurchased (and the amount with respect to which the Performance Allocation is
calculated) will be deemed to have been taken from the first capital
contribution of such Member (as such contribution has been adjusted for net
capital appreciation or depreciation, Management Fees, Manager Administrative
Services Fees and other expenses) until it is decreased to zero and from each
subsequent capital contribution until such contribution (as adjusted) is
decreased to zero).

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

Based upon profits for the period from April 1, 2008 to September 30, 2008,
there was no Incentive Allocation to the Special Member. This amount is subject
to change as Incentive Allocations occur at the end of each calendar year.

7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to,
short-selling activities, writing option contracts, contracts for differences,
and interest rate, credit default and total return equity swaps contracts. The
Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the value of the
investments in the Funds.

The Fund invests primarily in Investment Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act. The Investment Funds invest in actively traded securities and other
financial instruments using different strategies and investment techniques,
including leverage, that may involve significant risks. Although the Fund
attempts to diversify its risk by investing in Investment Funds managed by
different third party managers, the Investment Funds may nonetheless
independently invest a high percentage of their assets in the same or similar
specific sectors of the market in order to achieve a potentially greater
investment return. As a result, the Investment Funds may be more susceptible to
economic, political, and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the
market, positive and negative, and may experience increased volatility of the
Investment Funds' net asset value. The Fund invests in a limited number of
Investment Funds. Such concentration may result in additional risk. Because of
the limitation on rights of redemption and the fact that the Fund's limited
liability company interests will not be traded on any securities exchange or
other market and will be subject to substantial restrictions on transfer, and
because of the fact that the Fund may invest in Investment Funds that do not
permit frequent withdrawals and that may invest in illiquid securities, an
investment in the Fund is a highly illiquid investment and involves a
substantial degree of risk. Illiquid securities owned by Investment Funds are
riskier than liquid securities because the Investment Funds may not be able to
dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates,
or may be able to dispose of the illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced
price. Similarly, the illiquidity of the Investment Funds may cause investors to
incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the Fund
during or following periods of negative performance. Although the Investment
Manager and the Managing Member intend to recommend that quarterly offers be
made to repurchase up to 25% of the Fund's net assets, there can be no assurance
that the Fund will make such offers.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations that provide general indemnifications. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.
