                                      MORGAN STANLEY INDIA INVESTMENT FUND, INC.

                                      Overview

LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS

PERFORMANCE

For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Morgan Stanley India Investment Fund,
Inc. (the "Fund") had a total return, based on net asset value per share of
27.21%, net of fees, compared to 22.24% for the U.S. dollar adjusted Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) National Index (the "Index"). On December 31, 2004, the
closing price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange was $30.96,
representing a 6.4% premium to the Fund's net asset value per share.

FACTORS AFFECTING PERFORMANCE

    -   Despite a strong outperformance in the fourth quarter of 2004, the
        Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) India Index, an indicator of
        the Indian stock market, ended the year under-performing the broader
        MSCI Emerging Markets Index.

    -   Foreign institutional investor net inflows for 2004 of U.S. $8.7 billion
        were at a historic high.

    -   Compared to Index, the Fund had its largest overweight in industrials,
        predominantly in the power equipment sector. This reflects our current
        positive bias towards reforms in the power sector. We believe India is
        an "infrastructure deficit" country. This offers an opportunity for
        investors to participate in the engineering and construction sector as
        India builds roads, ports, airports and increases power generation and
        transmission capacity. The overweight in industrials contributed
        positively to performance.

    -   The underweight in the information technology sector detracted from
        performance, as the sector saw a sharp rebound in growth rates arising
        from increased "offshoring" of information technology services projects
        to India.

MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

    -   Many stocks in the Indian market have repeatedly had the potential to
        outperform, but have disappointed when expectations have been high.
        Instead of outperformance, headline Indian indexes have typically ended
        up performing in line with emerging markets over time.

    -   We believe that history may not repeat itself in this instance. The
        challenge for investors will be to focus on companies with high quality
        management that have the staying power to last beyond one short cycle.
        India offers tremendous sector diversity and stock selection
        opportunities.

    -   Moreover, the present government certainly has the opportunity to
        implement key reform measures over the next few months, which can in
        turn help the Indian market counter any global headwinds.


Sincerely,

/s/ Ronald E. Robison

                                      December 31, 2004

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Morgan Stanley India Investment Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in
Maryland on December 22, 1993, and is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment objective is long-term
capital appreciation through investments primarily in equity securities.

A.   ACCOUNTING POLICIES: The following significant accounting policies are in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for investment
companies. Such policies are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements. U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles may require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results
may differ from those estimates.

1.   SECURITY VALUATION: Equity securities listed on a U.S. exchange are valued
     at the latest quoted sales price on the valuation date. Equity securities
     listed or traded on NASDAQ, for which market quotations are available, are
     valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. Securities listed on a foreign
     exchange are valued at their closing price. Unlisted securities and listed
     securities not traded on the valuation date for which market quotations are
     readily available are valued at the mean between the current bid and asked
     prices obtained from reputable brokers. Debt securities purchased with
     remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, if it
     approximates value.

     All other securities and investments for which market values are not
     readily available, including restricted securities, and those securities
     for which it is inappropriate to determine prices in accordance with the
     aforementioned procedures, are valued at fair value as determined in good
     faith under procedures adopted by the Board of Directors, although the
     actual calculations may be done by others. Factors considered in making
     this determination may include, but are not limited to, information
     obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, or the appropriate stock
     exchange (for exchange-traded securities), analysis of the issuer's
     financial statements or other available documents and, if necessary,
     available information concerning other securities in similar circumstances.

     Most foreign markets close before the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).
     Occasionally, developments that could affect the closing prices of
     securities and other assets may occur between the times at which valuations
     of such securities are determined (that is, close of the foreign market on
     which the securities trade) and the close of business on the NYSE. If these
     developments are expected to materially affect the value of the securities,
     the valuations may be adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value as of
     the close of the NYSE, as determined in good faith under procedures
     established by the Board of Directors.

2.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements under
     which the Fund lends excess cash and takes possession of securities with an
     agreement that the counterparty will repurchase such securities. In
     connection with transactions in repurchase agreements, a bank as custodian
     for the Fund takes possession of the underlying securities (collateral),
     with a market value at least equal to the amount of the repurchase
     transaction, including principal and accrued interest. To the extent that
     any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the
     collateral is marked-to-market on a daily basis to determine the adequacy
     of the collateral. In the event of default on the obligation to repurchase,
     the Fund has the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds
     in satisfaction of the obligation. In the event of default or bankruptcy by
     the counterparty to the agreement, realization and/or retention of the
     collateral or proceeds may be subject to legal proceedings.

     The Fund, along with other affiliated investment companies, may utilize a
     joint trading account for the purpose of entering into one or more
     repurchase agreements.

3.   FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The books and records of the Fund are
     maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts denominated in Indian rupees are
     translated into U.S. dollars at the mean of the bid and asked prices of
     such currency against U.S. dollars last quoted by a major bank as follows:

     -  investments, other assets and liabilities at the prevailing rate of
        exchange on the valuation date;

     -  investment transactions and investment income at the prevailing rate of
        exchange on the dates of such transactions.

     Although the net assets of the Fund are presented at the foreign exchange
     rate and market values at the close of the period, the Fund does not
     isolate that portion of the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

     results of operations arising as a result of changes in the foreign
     exchange rate from the fluctuations arising from changes in the market
     prices of the securities held at period end. Similarly, the Fund does not
     isolate the effect of changes in the foreign exchange rate from the
     fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices of securities sold
     during the period. Accordingly, realized and unrealized foreign currency
     gains (losses) due to securities transactions are included in the reported
     net realized and unrealized gains (losses) on investment transactions and
     balances.

     Net realized gains (losses) on foreign currency transactions represent net
     foreign exchange gains (losses) from sales and maturities of foreign
     currency exchange contracts, disposition of foreign currency, currency
     gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement dates on
     securities transactions, and the difference between the amount of
     investment income and foreign withholding taxes recorded on the Fund's
     books and the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts actually received or paid. Net
     unrealized currency gains (losses) from valuing foreign currency
     denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are
     reflected as a component of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on
     investments and foreign currency translations in the Statement of Assets
     and Liabilities. The change in unrealized currency gains (losses) on
     foreign currency translations for the period is reflected in the Statement
     of Operations.

     A significant portion of the Fund's net assets consist of Indian securities
     which involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated
     with investments in the United States. In addition to its smaller size,
     less liquidity and greater volatility, the Indian securities market is less
     developed than the U.S. securities market and there is often substantially
     less publicly available information about Indian issuers than there is
     about U.S. issuers. Settlement mechanisms are also less developed and are
     accomplished, in certain cases, only through physical delivery, which may
     cause the Fund to experience delays or other difficulties in effecting
     transactions.

The Fund may use derivatives to achieve its investment objectives. The Fund may
engage in transactions in futures contracts on foreign currencies, stock
indices, as well as in options, swaps and structured notes. Consistent with the
Fund's investment objectives and policies, the Fund may use derivatives for
non-hedging as well as hedging purposes.

Following is a description of derivative instruments that the Fund has utilized
and their associated risks:

4.   FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS: The Fund may enter into foreign
     currency exchange contracts generally to attempt to protect securities and
     related receivables and payables against changes in future foreign exchange
     rates and, in certain situations, to gain exposure to a foreign currency. A
     foreign currency exchange contract is an agreement between two parties to
     buy or sell currency at a set price on a future date. The market value of
     the contract will fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. The
     contract is marked-to-market daily and the change in market value is
     recorded by the Fund as unrealized gain or loss. The Fund records realized
     gains or losses when the contract is closed equal to the difference between
     the value of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the
     time it was closed. Risk may arise upon entering into these contracts from
     the potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their
     contracts and is generally limited to the amount of unrealized gain on the
     contracts, if any, at the date of default. Risks may also arise from
     unanticipated movements in the value of a foreign currency relative to the
     U.S. dollar.

5.   RESTRICTED SECURITIES: The Fund may invest in unregistered or otherwise
     restricted securities. The term restricted securities refers to securities
     that are unregistered or are held by control persons of the issuer and
     securities that are subject to contractual restrictions on their resale. As
     a result, restricted securities may be more difficult to value and the Fund
     may have difficulty disposing of such assets either in a timely manner or
     for a reasonable price. In order to dispose of an unregistered security,
     the Fund, where it has contractual rights to do so, may have to cause such
     security to be registered. A considerable period may elapse between the
     time the decision is made to sell the security and the time the security is
     registered so that the Fund could sell it. Contractual restrictions on the
     resale of securities vary in length and scope and are generally the result
     of a negotiation between the issuer and acquiror of the securities. The
     Fund would, in either case, bear market risks during that period.

6.   OTHER: Security transactions are accounted for on the date the securities
     are purchased or sold. Investments in new Indian securities are made by
     making applications in investment the public offerings. The issue price, or
     a portion thereof, is paid at the time of application and reflected as
     share

                                                                               9

     application money on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Upon
     allotment of the securities, this amount plus any remaining amount of issue
     price is recorded as cost of investments. Realized gains and losses on the
     sale of investment securities are determined on the specific identified
     cost basis. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Dividend
     income is recorded on the ex-dividend date (except certain dividends which
     may be recorded as soon as the Fund is informed of such dividends) net of
     applicable withholding taxes, if any. Distributions to stockholders are
     recorded on the ex-dividend date.

B.   INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES: Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. (the
"Adviser") provides investment advisory services to the Fund under the terms of
an Investment Advisory and Management Agreement (the "Agreement"). Under the
Agreement, the Adviser is paid a fee computed weekly and payable monthly at an
annual rate of 1.10% of the Fund's average weekly net assets.

C.   ADMINISTRATION FEES: Prior to November 1, 2004, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
through its corporate affiliate, J.P. Morgan Investor Services Co. ("JPMIS"),
provided administrative services to the Fund under an Administration Agreement.
JPMIS was paid a fee computed weekly and payable monthly at an annual rate of
0.02435% of the Fund's average weekly net assets, plus $24,000 per annum. In
addition, the Fund was charged for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
JPMIS on its behalf.

Effective November 1, 2004, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. (MSIM)
serves as Administrator to the Fund pursuant to a new Administrative Agreement.
Under the new Administrative Agreement, the new administrative fee will be 0.08%
of the Fund's average weekly net assets. As approved by the Board of Directors,
MSIM has agreed to limit the new administration fee so that it will be no
greater than the old administrative fee of 0.02435% of the Fund's average weekly
net assets plus $24,000 per annum. This waiver is voluntary and may be
terminated at any time. For the year ended December 31, 2004, $36,000 of
administration fees were waived pursuant to this arrangement. Administrative
costs (including out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the ordinary course of
providing services under the Agreement, which were previously borne by Fund),
except pricing services and extraordinary expenses, will now be covered under
the Administration Fee. JPMIS will continue to provide fund accounting and other
services pursuant to a sub-administrative agreement, dated November 1, 2004,
with MSIM and receives compensation from MSIM for these services.

Multiconsult, Ltd., whose registered office is in Mauritius, provides
sub-administrative services to the Fund, including maintaining certain Fund
records and preparing certain periodic filings, under an agreement whereby
Multiconsult is paid a fee of $22,000 per annum.

D.   CUSTODIAN FEES: JPMorgan Chase Bank serves as custodian for the Fund. The
Custodian holds cash, securities, and other assets of the Fund as required by
the 1940 Act. Custody fees are payable monthly based on assets held in custody,
investment purchases and sales activity and account maintenance fees, plus
reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

E.   DIRECTORS FEES: The Fund pays each of its Mauritian Independent Directors
an annual fee of $7,500 and all other Independent Directors an annual fee of
$5,000. Additionally, each Mauritian Independent Director is paid a fee of $750
for each Board Meeting attended.

F.   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as
a regulated investment company and distribute all its taxable income.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is required in the financial
statements. Dividend income and distributions to stockholders are recorded on
the ex-dividend date.

Effective October 1, 2004 there is no capital gains tax in India for long-term
investments and the rate of capital gains tax for short-term investments is
10.455% for transactions conduct through a recognized stock exchange (the
capital gains rates were 10.455% for long-term investments and 31.365% for
short-term investments for the financial year April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2005).
The Fund invests in India through a registered branch office established in
Mauritius and, as a result, obtains the benefits under the double taxation
treaty between Mauritius and India ("Treaty"). To obtain benefits under the
double taxation treaty the Fund must meet certain tests and conditions,
including the establishment of Mauritius tax residence and related requirements.
The Fund has obtained a tax residence certification from the Mauritian
authorities and believes such certification is determinative of its resident
status for treaty purposes. A fund which is a tax resident in Mauritius under
the treaty but has no branch or permanent establishment in India will not be
subject to capital gains tax in India on the sale of securities, but is subject
to a 15% (under Article 10 of the India-Mauritius tax treaty) withholding tax on
dividends

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

declared, distributed or paid by an Indian company prior to June 1, 1997 and for
the period from April 1, 2002 through March 31, 2003. During the period June 1,
1997 through March 31, 2002 and after April 1, 2003, dividend income from
domestic companies was exempt from Indian income tax. The Fund currently is
subject to and accrues Indian withholding tax on interest earned on Indian
securities at 20.91%.The Treaty benefits accorded to foreign investors were
challenged by a non-governmental organization and the matter was litigated
before India's Supreme Court (the highest court in India). In October 2003,
India's Supreme Court upheld the validity of treaty benefits accorded to foreign
investors on the basis of a certificate of residence issued by Mauritian
authorities (such as the one obtained by the Fund).

The tax character of distributions paid may differ from the character of
distributions shown on the Statement of Changes in Net Assets due to short-term
capital gains being treated as ordinary income for tax purposes. The tax
character of distributions paid during 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

<Table>

      $  1,464         $  --        $  3,169        $  --
</Table>

The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to be paid by
the Fund are determined in accordance with Federal income tax regulations, which
may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The book/tax
differences are considered either temporary or permanent in nature.

Temporary differences are generally due to differing book and tax treatments for
the timing of the recognition of gains and losses on certain investment
transactions and the timing of the deductibility of certain expenses.

Permanent differences are generally due to differing treatments of gains and
losses related to foreign currency transactions. Permanent book and tax basis
differences may result in reclassifications among undistributed (distributions
in excess of) net investment income (or accumulated net investment loss),
accumulated net realized gain (loss) and paid-in capital.

At December 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

<Table>

          $  1,210                   $  2,215
</Table>

At December 31, 2004, the U.S. Federal income tax cost basis of investments was
$272,403,000 and, accordingly, net unrealized appreciation for U.S. Federal
income tax purposes was $186,312,000 of which $197,930,000 related to
appreciated securities and $11,618,000 related to depreciated securities.

During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund utilized capital loss
carryforwards for U.S. Federal income tax purposes of approximately $61,101,000.

To the extent that capital loss carryforwards are used to offset any future
capital gains realized during the carryforward period as provided by U.S.
Federal income tax regulations, no capital gains tax liability will be incurred
by the Fund for gains realized and not distributed. To the extent that capital
gains are offset, such gains will not be distributed to the stockholders.

Net capital, currency, and passive foreign investment company losses incurred
after October 31, and within the taxable year are deemed to arise on the first
day of the Fund's next taxable year. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the
Fund did not defer any capital, currency, or passive foreign investment company
losses to January 1, 2005, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.

G.   CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS: The Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses
pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

H.   OTHER: During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund made purchases and
sales totaling $184,073,000 and $195,093,000 respectively, of investment
securities other than long-term U.S. Government securities and short-term
investments. There were no purchases or sales of long-term U.S. Government
securities.

Future economic and political developments in India could adversely affect the
liquidity or value, or both, of securities in which the Fund is invested. In
addition, the Fund's ability to hedge its currency risk is limited and
accordingly, the Fund may be exposed to currency devaluation and other exchange
rate fluctuations.

                                                                              11

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

On August 10, 1998, the Fund commenced a share repurchase program for purposes
of enhancing stockholder value and reducing the discount at which the Fund's
shares trade from their net asset value. During the year ended December 31,
2004, the Fund did not repurchase any of its shares. Since the inception of the
program, the Fund has repurchased 8,450,680 of its shares at an average discount
of 30.06% from net asset value per share. The Fund expects to continue to
repurchase its outstanding shares at such time and in such amounts as it
believes will further the accomplishment of the foregoing objectives, subject to
review by the Board of Directors.

On December 14, 2004 the Officers of the Fund, pursuant to authority granted by
the Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.0714 per share, derived
from net investment income, payable on January 7, 2005 to stockholders of record
on December 23, 2004.

FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

For the year ended December 31, 2004 qualified dividend income totaled
$1,464,000.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
MORGAN STANLEY INDIA INVESTMENT FUND, INC.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Morgan
Stanley India Investment Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of December 31, 2004, and the related statement of operations
for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's
internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and financial
highlights, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of
December 31, 2004, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by other
appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers were not received. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Morgan
Stanley India Investment Fund, Inc. at December 31, 2004, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

     Pursuant to the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
each stockholder will be deemed to have elected, unless American Stock Transfer
& Trust Company (the "Plan Agent") is otherwise instructed by the stockholder in
writing, to have all distributions automatically reinvested in Fund shares.
Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional voluntary cash
payments to the Plan Agent, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000, for
investment in Fund shares.

     Dividend and capital gain distributions will be reinvested on the
reinvestment date in full and fractional shares. If the market price per share
equals or exceeds net asset value per share on the reinvestment date, the Fund
will issue shares to participants at net asset value. If net asset value is less
than 95% of the market price on the reinvestment date, shares will be issued at
95% of the market price. If net asset value exceeds the market price on the
reinvestment date, participants will receive shares valued at market price. The
Fund may purchase shares of its Common Stock in the open market in connection
with dividend reinvestment requirements at the discretion of the Board of
Directors. Should the Fund declare a dividend or capital gain distribution
payable only in cash, the Plan Agent will purchase Fund shares for participants
in the open market as agent for the participants.

     The Plan Agent's fees for the reinvestment of dividends and distributions
will be paid by the Fund. However, each participant's account will be charged a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred on any open market purchases
effected on such participant's behalf. A participant will also pay brokerage
commissions incurred on purchases made by voluntary cash payments. Although
stockholders in the Plan may receive no cash distributions, participation in the
Plan will not relieve participants of any income tax which may be payable on
such dividends or distributions.

     In the case of stockholders, such as banks, brokers or nominees, that hold
shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer
the Plan on the basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the
stockholder as representing the total amount registered in the stockholder's
name and held for the account of beneficial owners who are participating in the
Plan.

     Stockholders who do not wish to have distributions automatically reinvested
should notify the Plan Agent in writing. There is no penalty for
non-participation or withdrawal from the Plan, and stockholders who have
previously withdrawn from the Plan may rejoin at any time. Requests for
additional information or any correspondence concerning the Plan should be
directed to the Plan Agent at:

(a)      The Fund has adopted a code of ethics (the "Code of Ethics") that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,

functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the Fund or a
third party.

(b)      No information need be disclosed pursuant to this paragraph.

(c)      The Fund has amended its Code of Ethics during the period covered by
the shareholder report presented in Item 1 hereto to delete from the end of the
following paragraph on page 2 of the Code the phrase "to the detriment of the
Fund."

(e)      Not applicable.

(f)

         (1)      The Fund's Code of Ethics is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

         (2)      Not applicable.

         (3)      Not applicable.

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Fund's Board of Directors has determined that it has two "audit committee
financial experts" serving on its audit committee, each of whom are
"independent" Directors: Dr. Manuel H. Johnson and Joseph J. Kearns. Under
applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit committee
financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose, including
without limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933,
as a result of being designated or identified as an audit committee financial
expert. The designation or identification of a person as an audit committee
financial expert does not impose on such person any duties, obligations, or
liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations, and liabilities
imposed on such person as a member of the audit committee and Board of Directors
in the absence of such designation or identification.

                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                  MORGAN STANLEY RETAIL AND INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS

                    AS ADOPTED AND AMENDED JULY 23, 2004,(1)

- -    Statement of Principles

The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund.

The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an independent
auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit committee's
administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The SEC's rules
establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which the SEC
considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be pre-approved
without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the Audit Committee
("GENERAL PRE-APPROVAL"); or require the specific pre-approval of the Audit
Committee or its delegate ("SPECIFIC PRE-APPROVAL"). The Audit Committee
believes that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result
in an effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and All
Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The
term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or
subtract from the list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based
on subsequent determinations.

- ----------
(1)  This Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy and
     Procedures (the "POLICY"), adopted as of the date above, supersedes and
     replaces all prior versions that may have been adopted from time to time.

<Page>

The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by which
the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes that
implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent Auditors'
independence.

- -    Delegation

As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may delegate
either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member
to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes
only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled
meeting.

- -    Audit Services

The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the specific
pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual financial
statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the Independent
Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial statements. These
other procedures include information systems and procedural reviews and testing
performed in order to understand and place reliance on the systems of internal
control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit Committee will
approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from
changes in audit scope, Fund structure or other items.

In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1. All
other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

- -    Audit-related Services

Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are reasonably
related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's financial
statements and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered Entities or
that are traditionally performed by the Independent Auditors. Because the Audit
Committee believes that the provision of Audit-related services does not impair
the independence of the auditor and is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to
Audit-related services. Audit-related services include, among others, accounting
consultations related to accounting, financial reporting or disclosure matters

<Page>

not classified as "Audit services"; assistance with understanding and
implementing new accounting and financial reporting guidance from rulemaking
authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures related to accounting
and/or billing records required to respond to or comply with financial,
accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with internal control
reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in Appendix B.2.
All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

- -    Tax Services

The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services.

Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved the
Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services in Appendix B.3 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

- -    All Other Services

The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix B.4.
Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).

- -    Pre-Approval Fee Levels or Budgeted Amounts

Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided by
the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit Committee.
Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require specific
pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of the
overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services.

- -    Procedures

All requests or applications for services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed
description of the services to be

<Page>

rendered. The Fund's Chief Financial Officer will determine whether such
services are included within the list of services that have received the general
pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will be informed on a
timely basis of any such services rendered by the Independent Auditors. Requests
or applications to provide services that require specific approval by the Audit
Committee will be submitted to the Audit Committee by both the Independent
Auditors and the Fund's Chief Financial Officer, and must include a joint
statement as to whether, in their view, the request or application is consistent
with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to monitor
the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and to
determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The Fund's
Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis
on the results of its monitoring. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and
management will immediately report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any
breach of this Policy that comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial
Officer or any member of management.

- -    Additional Requirements

The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual
basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent Auditors
and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as reviewing a
formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating all
relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

- -    Covered Entities

Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.     POLICY STATEMENT

INTRODUCTION - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policies and
procedures for voting proxies with respect to securities held in the accounts of
clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary Investment
Management services and for which a MSIM entity has the authority to vote their
proxies. The policies and procedures and general guidelines in this section will
be reviewed and, as necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised
proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by these policies and procedures
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley Alternative Investment Partners, L.P., Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley Investment Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management
Company, Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan
Stanley Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Investments LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP,
Van Kampen Investment Advisory Corp., Van Kampen Asset Management Inc., and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each a "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will vote proxies as part of its authority to manage,
acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the MSIM registered
management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and Advisor
Funds)(collectively referred to as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM Fund will vote
proxies pursuant to authority granted under its applicable investment advisory
agreement or, in the absence of such authority, as authorized by its Board of
Directors or Trustees. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies if the "named
fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for itself, or in the
case of an account not governed by ERISA, the Investment Management Agreement
does not authorize the MSIM Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in
a prudent and diligent manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients,
including beneficiaries of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for
which we manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term
investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a client or
its fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a statement of proxy voting
policy. In these situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's
policy unless to do so would be inconsistent with applicable laws or regulations
or the MSIM Affiliate's fiduciary responsibility.

PROXY RESEARCH SERVICES - To assist the MSIM Affiliates in their responsibility
for voting proxies and the overall global proxy voting process, Institutional
Shareholder Services ("ISS") and the Investor Responsibility Research Center
("IRRC") have been retained as experts in the proxy voting and corporate
governance area. ISS and IRRC are

<Page>

independent advisers that specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level
proxy-related services to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors,
custodians, consultants, and other institutional investors. The services
provided to MSIM Affiliates include in-depth research, global issuer analysis,
and voting recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote
execution, reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see
Section IV.A. below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided
by the proxy research services.

VOTING PROXIES FOR CERTAIN NON-US COMPANIES - While the proxy voting process is
well established in the United States and other developed markets with a number
of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting proxies
of non-US companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly emerging
markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent a MSIM
Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are not
limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language other
than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder meetings;
(iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's jurisdiction
of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote proxies in person,
(v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the securities for a period of
time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and (vi) requirements to provide
local agents with power of attorney to facilitate the MSIM Affiliate's voting
instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies will be voted on a best
efforts basis only, consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. ISS has been
retained to provide assistance to the MSIM Affiliates in connection with voting
their clients' non-US proxies.

II.    GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) these Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures, including the guidelines set forth below. These
guidelines address a broad

<Page>

range of issues, including board size and composition, executive compensation,
anti-takeover proposals, capital structure proposals and social responsibility
issues and are meant to be general voting parameters on issues that arise most
frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however, may vote in a manner that is contrary
to the following general guidelines, pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section IV. below, provided the vote is consistent with the Client Proxy
Standard.

            -     Requirement that members of the company's compensation,

                  proposals that relate to the "transaction of such other
                  business which may come before the meeting."

       2.   The following non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
            substantive financial or best interest impact on a shareholder, are
            generally voted in support of management, subject to the review and
            approval of the Proxy Review Committee, as appropriate.

            CAPITALIZATION CHANGES

            Capitalization changes that eliminate other classes of stock and
                  voting rights.

            Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of
                  common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) if:
                  (i) a clear and legitimate business purpose is stated; (ii)
                  the number of shares requested is reasonable in relation to
                  the purpose for which authorization is requested; and (iii)
                  the authorization does not exceed 100% of shares currently
                  authorized and at least 30% of the new authorization will be
                  outstanding.

                  proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth
                  in the corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do not
                  adjust proportionately to the authorized share amount will
                  generally be approved if the resulting increase in authorized
                  shares coincides with the proxy guidelines set forth above for
                  common stock increases.

            COMPENSATION

                  amend the charters or bylaws.

                  anti-takeover measures or other provisions restricting the
                  rights of shareholders.

       3.   The following non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
            substantive financial or best interest impact on the shareholder,
            are generally voted AGAINST (notwithstanding management support),
            subject to the review and approval of the Proxy Review Committee, as
            appropriate.

            -     Capitalization changes that add classes of stock which

            -     Changes in capitalization by 100% or more.

            -     Compensation proposals that allow for discounted stock options
                  that have not been offered to employees in general.

            -     Amendments to bylaws that would require a supermajority
                  shareholder vote to pass or repeal certain provisions.

            -     Proposals to indemnify auditors.

<Page>

       4.   The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially may
            have a potential financial or best interest impact on an issuer, are
            voted as determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

            CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS

            -     Mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate transactions
                  (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of assets, reorganizations,
                  restructurings and recapitalizations) will be examined on a
                  case-by-case basis. In all cases, ISS and IRRC research and
                  analysis will be used along with MSIM Affiliates' research and
                  analysis, based on, among other things, MSIM internal
                  company-specific knowledge.

            -     Change-in-control provisions in non-salary compensation plans,
                  employment contracts, and severance agreements that benefit
                  management and would be costly to shareholders if triggered.

            -     Shareholders rights plans that allow appropriate offers to
                  shareholders to be blocked by the board or trigger provisions
                  that prevent legitimate offers from proceeding.

            Executive/Director stock option plans. Generally, stock option plans
                  should meet the following criteria:

                  (i)   Whether the stock option plan is incentive based;

                  (ii)  For mature companies, should be no more than 5% of the
                        issued capital at the time of approval;

                  (iii) For growth companies, should be no more than 10% of the
                        issued capital at the time of approval.

            ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

            Proposals requiring shareholder ratification of poison pills.

            Anti-takeover and related provisions that serve to prevent the
                  majority of shareholders from exercising their rights or
                  effectively deter the appropriate tender offers and other
                  offers.

B.     SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

       1.   The following shareholder proposals are generally supported, subject
            to the review and approval of the Proxy Review Committee, as
            appropriate:

            -     Requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of

            -     Proposals that request or require disclosure of executive
                  compensation in addition to the disclosure required by the
                  Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations.

            -     Proposals that limit retirement benefits or executive
                  compensation.

            -     Requirements that the issuer prepare reports that are costly
                  to provide or that would require duplicative efforts or
                  expenditures that are of a non-business nature or would
                  provide no pertinent information from the perspective of
                  institutional shareholders.

            -     Restrictions related to social, political or special interest
                  issues that impact the ability of the company to do business
                  or be competitive and that have a significant financial or
                  best interest impact to the shareholders.

            -     Proposals that require inappropriate endorsements or corporate
                  actions.

IV.    ADMINISTRATION OF PROXY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A.     PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

       1.   The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible for
            creating and implementing MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures
            and, in this regard, has expressly adopted them. Following are some
            of the functions and responsibilities of the Committee.

            (a)   The Committee, which will consist of members designated by
                  MSIM's Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for
                  establishing MSIM's proxy voting policies and guidelines and
                  determining how MSIM will vote proxies on an ongoing basis.

            (b)   The Committee will periodically review and have the authority
                  to amend as necessary MSIM's proxy voting policies and
                  guidelines (as expressed in these Proxy Voting Policy and
                  Procedures) and establish and direct voting positions
                  consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

            (c)   The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other
                  matters): (1) address any outstanding issues relating to
                  MSIM's Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures; and (2) generally
                  review proposals at upcoming shareholder meetings of MSIM
                  portfolio companies in accordance with this Policy and
                  Procedures including, as appropriate, the voting results of
                  prior shareholder meetings of the same issuer where a similar
                  proposal was presented to shareholders. The Committee, or its
                  designee, will timely communicate to ISS MSIM's Proxy Voting
                  Policy and Procedures (and any amendments to them and/or any
                  additional guidelines or procedures it may adopt).

            (d)   The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other
                  matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing certain
                  shares of the same issuer that are the subject of the same
                  proxy solicitation and held by one or more MSIM portfolios to
                  be voted differently than other shares) and/or "override
                  voting" (i.e., voting

<Page>

                  all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner contrary to the
                  Procedures); (2) review and approve upcoming votes, as
                  appropriate, for matters for which specific direction has been
                  provided in Sections I, II, and III above; and (3) determine
                  how to vote matters for which specific direction has not been
                  provided in Sections I, II and III above. Split votes will
                  generally not be approved within a single Global Investor
                  Group team. The Committee may take into account ISS
                  recommendations and the research provided by IRRC as well as
                  any other relevant information they may request or receive.

            (e)   In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the
                  Committee determines that an issue raises a potential material
                  conflict of interest, or gives rise to the appearance of a
                  potential material conflict of interest, the Committee will
                  designate a special committee to review, and recommend a
                  course of action with respect to, the conflict(s) in question
                  ("Special Committee"). The Special Committee may request the
                  assistance of the Law and Compliance Departments and will have
                  sole discretion to cast a vote. In addition to the research
                  provided by ISS and IRRC, the Special Committee may request
                  analysis from MSIM Affiliate investment professionals and
                  outside sources to the extent it deems appropriate.

            (f)   The Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s),
                  will document in writing all of their decisions and actions,
                  which documentation will be maintained by the Committee and
                  the Special Committee, or their designee(s) for a period of at
                  least 6 years. To the extent these decisions relate to a
                  security held by a MSIM U.S. registered investment company,
                  the Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s),
                  will report their decisions to each applicable Board of
                  Trustees/Directors of those investment companies at each
                  Board's next regularly Scheduled Board meeting. The report
                  will contain information concerning decisions made by the
                  Committee and Special Committee during the most recently ended
                  calendar quarter immediately preceding the Board meeting.

            (g)   The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s),
                  will timely communicate to applicable PMs, the Compliance
                  Departments and, as necessary to ISS, decisions of the
                  Committee and Special Committee so that, among other things,
                  ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                           ADOPTED SEPTEMBER 28, 2004

I.     This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
       Morgan Stanley complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and
       each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
       President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
       performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
       forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

       -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
            or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
            relationships.

       -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
            reports and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the
            Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
            communications made by the Fund;

       -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
            regulations;

       -    prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
            appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

            Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.    COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
       INTEREST

       OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

       Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined

<Page>

in the Investment Company Act) of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment
adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or
identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is
not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such
conflicts fall outside the parameters of this Code, unless or until the General
Counsel determines that any violation of such programs and procedures is also a
violation of this Code.

       Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

       Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

       Each Covered Officer must not:

       -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
            influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
            whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
            indirectly);

       -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
            individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
            benefit of the Fund; or

       -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
            contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
            trade personally or cause others to trade personally in
            contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

       Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

<Page>

       Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

       -    service or significant business relationships as a director on the
            board of any public or private company;

       -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
            and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
            with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings,
            not including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting
            events or other similar entertainment; provided it is
            business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
            place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

       -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
            relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than
            its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated
            person thereof; and

       -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
            charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
            transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
            interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
            compensation or equity ownership.

III.   DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

       -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
            disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
            Funds;

       -    each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
            others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
            within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
            Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators and
            self-regulatory organizations;

       -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
            area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of
            the Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting
            full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
            reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
            in other public communications made by the Funds; and

       -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
            compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
            laws, rules and regulations.

<Page>

IV.    REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

       Each Covered Officer must:

       -    upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
            Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
            received, read and understands the Code;

       -    annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with
            the requirements of the Code;

       -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or
            any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
            potential violations that are made in good faith; and

       -    notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of
            any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation
            of this Code.

       The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any waivers(2) sought
by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or
Funds.

       The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

       -    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
            any potential violations reported to him;

       -    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
            violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
            any further action;

       -    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
            reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

       -    if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
            "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
            "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
            relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will
            consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
            appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
            notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or
            its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or
            other appropriate disciplinary actions;

- ----------
(2)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
          a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."

<Page>

       -    the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
            relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
            as appropriate; and

       -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
            be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.     OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

       This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.    AMENDMENTS

       Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.

VII.   CONFIDENTIALITY

       All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII.  INTERNAL USE

       The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion


I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.
