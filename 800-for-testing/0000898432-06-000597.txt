CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this semi-annual report for Neuberger Berman Real
Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. for the six months ended April 30, 2006. The
report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Fund's investments, and
its unaudited financial statements for the reporting period.

The Fund seeks to provide high current income with capital appreciation as a
secondary objective. To pursue both, we have assembled a portfolio with a broad
mix of equity securities of real estate investment trusts (REITs) and other real
estate companies.

Portfolio Manager Steven Brown's investment approach combines analysis of
security fundamentals and real estate with property sector diversification. His
disciplined valuation methodology seeks real estate company securities that are
attractively priced relative to both their historical growth rates and the
valuation of other property sectors.

We believe our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior returns over the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,


/s/ Peter Sundman

REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. Portfolio Commentary

For the six months ended April 30, 2006, on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis, the
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (AMEX: NRO) provided a
13.25% return, compared to a gain of 14.90% for the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs
Index. The Fund's relative underperformance can be attributed to its holdings of
real estate investment trust (REIT) preferred stocks, which did not perform as
well as REIT common stocks. During the period, REITs generally benefited from
ongoing investor interest in this segment of the market and healthy operating
results, which we expect to continue over the coming quarters.

During the six-month reporting period, the commercial real estate market was
robust, as occupancies and rents improved due to a healthy economy and stronger
demand than supply in most regions of the country. Despite ongoing rate hikes by
the Federal Reserve, the long-term interest rate environment was relatively
benign, while REIT earnings were strong in both the fourth quarter of (calendar)
2005 and the first quarter of 2006. A variety of property sectors showed
strength, particularly Office properties, Shopping Centers, Apartments and
Hotels.

Gains in the Apartment sector reflected a slowdown in the housing market, as
higher interest rates and slower housing price appreciation lessened the
attractiveness of buying homes and encouraged renters to stay longer. With a
slower supply of new apartments, we anticipate improving occupancy and economics
for apartment REITs.

REITs that own office buildings were bolstered by growing evidence of
improvement in the office market, particularly over the last three months of the
period, as occupancy and expectations for rising rents improved. In addition,
community shopping centers and hotels performed well. With fundamentals
particularly strong in the Lodging/Resort sector, a number of hotel REITs have
been acquired by private buyers, reflecting optimism for continued improvement.

On the downside, Regional Malls lagged over the six-month period, as investors
showed concern that a slowdown in housing price appreciation and the rise in
interest rates would have a negative impact on consumers. Despite the ongoing
strength of consumer spending, we think this remains a worrisome issue. The
Health Care sector also exhibited weakness due to concerns over new government
reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid and the potential impact of higher
interest rates on their ability to finance acquisitions.

In this environment, the Fund provided strong absolute returns, but trailed the
benchmark largely due to a roughly 25% weighting in REIT preferred stocks, which
advanced but not as much as REITs generally. However, we purchased these
securities for their income yields rather than potential for price appreciation
and are optimistic about their future contribution to the overall strategy. The
balance of our portfolio only modestly trailed the benchmark, as our overweight
and underperformance in Health Care detracted from performance, as did our stock
selection in Lodging/Resorts and the Diversified sector. Shopping Center and
Apartment holdings were positives relative to the benchmark.

Looking forward, we believe that the REIT market is unlikely to maintain the
exceptional performance it has shown over the past six months. Still, our
outlook remains positive for a number of reasons. First, the supply growth of
commercial real estate has been modest, due to the increased costs of raw
materials, construction and financing, and is likely to remain that way for the
next 12-18 months. We anticipate that this dynamic, combined with what we expect
to be modest economic growth, bodes well for REIT earnings and price performance
moving into the second half of the fiscal year.

In addition, we expect to see solid dividend growth from REITs, as well as a
continuation of the merger and acquisition activity that has taken place over
the past 12 months. Although current yields are lower than usual, we believe
that they will grow over time through dividend increases reflecting the ongoing
strength of the commercial real estate market.

Sincerely,


/s/ Steven R. Brown

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investments in equity securities by Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities
     Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") are valued at the latest sale price where
     that price is readily available; securities for which no sales were
     reported, unless otherwise noted, are valued at the last available bid
     price. Securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market are normally
     valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") provided
     by NASDAQ each business day. The NOCP is the most recently reported price
     as of 4:00:02 p.m., Eastern time, unless that price is outside the range of
     the "inside" bid and asked prices (i.e., the bid and asked prices that
     dealers quote to each other when trading for their own accounts); in that
     case, NASDAQ will adjust the price to equal the inside bid or asked price,
     whichever is closer. Because of delays in reporting trades, the NOCP may
     not be based on the price of the last trade to occur before the market
     closes. The Fund values all other securities, including securities for
     which the necessary last sale, asked and/or bid prices are not readily
     available, by methods the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") has
     approved on the belief that they reflect fair value. Numerous factors may
     be considered when determining the fair value of a security, including
     available analyst, media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and
     whether the issuer of the security being fair valued has other securities
     outstanding. Foreign security prices are furnished by independent quotation
     services and expressed in local currency values. Foreign security prices
     are translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars using the exchange
     rate as of 12:00 noon, Eastern time. The Board has approved the use of FT
     Interactive Data Corporation ("FT Interactive") to assist in determining
     the fair value of the Fund's foreign equity securities when changes in the
     value of a certain index suggest that the closing prices on the foreign
     exchanges may no longer represent the amount that the Fund could expect to
     receive for those securities. In this event, FT Interactive will provide
     adjusted prices for certain foreign equity securities using a statistical
     analysis of historical correlations of multiple factors. In the absence of
     precise information about the market values of these foreign securities as
     of the close of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board has determined on
     the basis of available data that prices adjusted in this way are likely to
     be closer to the prices the Fund could realize on a current sale than are
     the prices of those securities established at the close of the foreign
     markets in which the securities primarily trade. However, fair value prices
     are necessarily estimates, and there is no assurance that such a price will
     be at or close to the price at which the security next trades. Short-term
     debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be valued at cost
     which, when combined with interest earned, approximates market value.

#    At cost, which approximates market value.

##   At April 30, 2006, the cost of investments for U.S. federal income tax
     purposes was $759,637,000. Gross unrealized appreciation of investments was
     $121,908,000 and gross unrealized depreciation of investments was
     $3,007,000, resulting in net unrealized appreciation of $118,901,000, based
     on cost for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

@    Neuberger Berman Prime Money Fund ("Prime Money") is also managed by
     Neuberger Berman Management Inc. (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements) and may be considered an affiliate since it has the same
     officers, Board members, and investment manager as the Fund and because, at
     times, the Fund may own 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
     Prime Money.

(E)  All or a portion of this security is on loan (see Note A of Notes to
     Financial Statements).

++   Managed by an affiliate of Neuberger Berman Management Inc. and could be
     deemed an affiliate of the Fund (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements).

(n)  Restricted security subject to restrictions on resale under federal
     securities laws. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A
     and have been deemed by the investment manager to be liquid. At April 30,
     2006, these securities amounted to $1,270,000 or 0.2% of net assets
     applicable to common shareholders.

(OO) All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for interest
     rate swap contracts.

*    Non-income producing security.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the
     "Fund") was organized as a Maryland corporation on August 28, 2003 as a
     non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Board of
     Directors of the Fund (the "Board") may classify or re-classify any
     unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes of preferred
     stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
     ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on a trade date basis. Dividend income is recorded on the
     ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any,
     are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Interest
     income, including accretion of original issue discount, where applicable,
     and accretion of discount on short-term investments, if any, is recorded on
     the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from securities transactions
     and foreign currency transactions, if any, are recorded on the basis of
     identified cost and stated separately in the Statement of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: It is the policy of the Fund to continue to qualify
     as a regulated investment company by complying with the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
     investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its earnings to
     its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax provision is
     required.

     Income distributions and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
     due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment
     securities held by the Fund, timing differences and differing
     characterization of distributions made by the Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2005, permanent differences resulting
     primarily from different book and tax accounting for distributions in
     excess of earnings and income recognized on interest rate swaps were
     reclassified at fiscal year end. These reclassifications had no effect on
     net income, net assets applicable to common shareholders or net asset value
     per common share of the Fund.


                                       12

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October 31,
     2005 and October 31, 2004 was as follows:

</Table>

     As of October 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings
     (accumulated losses) on a U.S. federal income tax basis were as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
     UNDISTRIBUTED   UNDISTRIBUTED     UNREALIZED          LOSS

</Table>

     The difference between book and tax basis distributable earnings is
     attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments and
     income recognized on interest rate swaps.

5    DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund earns income, net of expenses,
     daily on its investments. It is the policy of the Fund to declare quarterly
     and pay monthly distributions to common shareholders. The Fund has adopted
     a policy to pay common shareholders a stable monthly distribution. The
     Fund's ability to satisfy its policy will depend on a number of factors,
     including the stability of income received from its investments, the
     availability of capital gains, distributions paid on preferred shares and
     the level of expenses. In an effort to maintain a stable distribution
     amount, the Fund may pay distributions consisting of net investment income,
     realized gains and paid-in capital. There is no assurance that the Fund
     will always be able to pay distributions of a particular size, or that
     distributions will consist solely of net investment income and realized
     capital gains. The composition of the Fund's distributions for the calendar
     year 2006 will be reported to Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099DIV. The
     Fund may pay distributions in excess of those required by its stable
     distribution policy to avoid excise tax or to satisfy the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. Distributions to common
     shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Net realized capital gains, if
     any, will be offset to the extent of any available capital loss
     carryforwards. Any such offset will not reduce the level of the stable
     distribution paid by the Fund. Distributions to preferred shareholders are
     accrued and determined as described in Note A-7.

     The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities issued
     by real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts
     ("REITs"). The distributions received from REITs held by the Fund are
     generally comprised of income, capital gains, and return of REIT capital,
     but the REITs do not report this information to the Fund until the
     following calendar year. At October 31, 2005, the Fund estimated these
     amounts within the financial statements since the information is not
     available from the REITs until after the Fund's fiscal year-end. At April
     30, 2006, the Fund estimated these amounts for the period January 1, 2006
     through April 30, 2006 within the financial statements since the 2006
     information is not available from the REITs until after the Fund's fiscal
     period. For the year ended October 31, 2005, the

                                       13
<Page>

     character of distributions paid to shareholders is disclosed within the
     Statement of Changes and is also based on these estimates. All estimates
     are based upon REIT information sources available to the Fund together with
     actual IRS Forms 1099DIV received to date. Based on past experience it is
     probable that a portion of the Fund's distributions during the current
     fiscal year will be considered tax return of capital but the actual amount
     of tax return of capital, if any, is not determinable until after the
     Fund's fiscal year end. After calendar year-end, when the Fund learns the
     nature of the distributions paid by REITs during that year, distributions
     previously identified as income are often recharacterized as return of
     capital and/or capital gain. After all applicable REITs have informed the
     Fund of the actual breakdown of distributions paid to the Fund during its
     fiscal year, estimates previously recorded are adjusted to reflect actual
     results. As a result, the composition of the Fund's distributions as
     reported herein may differ from the final composition determined after
     calendar year-end and reported to Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099DIV.

     On March 30, 2006, the Fund declared two monthly distributions to common
     shareholders in the amount of $0.10 per share per month, payable after the
     close of the reporting period, on May 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006, to
     shareholders of record on May 15, 2006 and June 15, 2006, respectively,
     with ex-dates of May 11, 2006 and June 13, 2006, respectively.

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the Fund.
     Expenses borne by the complex of related investment companies, which
     includes open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management
     serves as investment manager, that are not directly attributed to the Fund
     are allocated among the Fund and the other investment companies in the
     complex or series thereof on the basis of relative net assets, except where
     a more appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On December 10, 2003, the Fund re-classified
     12,000 unissued shares of capital stock as Series A Auction Market
     Preferred Shares, Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares, Series C
     Auction Market Preferred Shares and Series D Auction Market Preferred
     Shares ("AMPS"). On January 27, 2004, the Fund issued 2,450 Series A AMPS,
     2,450 Series B AMPS, 2,450 Series C AMPS and 2,450 Series D AMPS. All AMPS
     have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share plus any accumulated
     unpaid distributions, whether or not earned or declared by the Fund, but
     excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation Value").

     Except when the Fund has declared a special rate period, distributions to
     preferred shareholders, which are cumulative, are accrued daily and paid
     every 7 days for Series A and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C
     and Series D AMPS. Distribution rates are reset every 7 days for Series A
     and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C and Series D AMPS based on
     the results of an auction, except during special rate periods. For the six
     months ended April 30, 2006, distribution rates ranged from 3.90% to 4.72%
     for Series A, 3.73% to 4.75% for Series B, 3.90% to 4.80% for Series C and
     3.75% to 4.80% for Series D AMPS. The Fund declared distributions to
     preferred shareholders for the period May 1, 2006 to May 31, 2006 of
     ($248,063, $245,406, $257,162 and $252,604) for Series A, Series B, Series
     C and Series D AMPS, respectively.

                                       14
<Page>

     The Fund may redeem AMPS, in whole or in part, on the second business day
     preceding any distribution payment date at Liquidation Value. The Fund is
     also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS. Failure to
     comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
     distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or
     could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation Value. The
     holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
     holders of common shares as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
     separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or the Fund's
     charter. The holders of the AMPS, voting as a separate class, are entitled
     at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a majority of
     the Directors of the Fund if the Fund fails to pay distributions on AMPS
     for two consecutive years.

8    INTEREST RATE SWAPS: The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
     transactions, with institutions that Management has determined are
     creditworthy, to reduce the risk that an increase in short-term interest
     rates could reduce common share net earnings as a result of leverage. Under
     the terms of the interest rate swap contracts, the Fund agrees to pay the
     swap counter party a fixed-rate payment in exchange for the counter party's
     paying the Fund a variable-rate payment that is intended to approximate all
     or a portion of the Fund's variable-rate payment obligation on the Fund's
     AMPS. The fixed-rate and variable-rate payment flows are netted against
     each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other on a
     monthly basis. The Fund segregates cash or liquid securities having a value
     at least equal to the Fund's net payment obligations under any swap
     transaction, marked to market daily.

     Risks may arise if the counter party to a swap contract fails to comply
     with the terms of its contract. The loss incurred by the failure of a
     counter party is generally limited to the net interest payment to be
     received by the Fund and/or the termination value at the end of the
     contract. Additionally, risks may arise from movements in interest rates
     unanticipated by Management.

     Periodic expected interim net interest payments or receipts on the swaps
     are recorded as an adjustment to unrealized gains/losses, along with the
     fair value of the future periodic payment streams on the swaps. The
     unrealized gains/losses associated with the periodic interim net interest
     payments are reclassified to realized gains/losses in conjunction with the
     actual net receipt or payment of such amounts. The reclassifications do not
     impact the Fund's total net assets applicable to common shareholders. At
     April 30, 2006, the Fund had outstanding interest rate swap contracts as
     follows:

     securities lending arrangements using a third party, eSecLending, to secure
     bids. Pursuant to such arrangements, eSecLending currently acts as lending
     agent for the Fund and assisted the Fund in conducting a bidding process to
     identify principals that would guarantee a certain amount of revenue to the
     Fund.

     Under securities lending arrangements, the Fund receives cash collateral at
     the beginning of each transaction equal to at least 102% of the prior day's
     market value of the loaned securities (105% in the case of international
     securities). The Fund invests the cash collateral in the Neuberger Berman
     Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC ("Quality Fund"), a fund managed by
     Lehman Brothers Asset Management LLC, an affiliate of Management, as
     approved by the Board.

     Income from the lending program represents income earned on the cash
     collateral and, where necessary, payment under the guarantee for the Fund,
     less fees and expenses associated with the loans. These amounts are
     reflected in the Statement of Operations under the caption "Income from
     securities loaned."

10   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
     institutions that Management has determined are creditworthy. Each
     repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The Fund requires that the
     securities purchased in a repurchase agreement be transferred to the
     custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the Fund to assert a perfected
     security interest in those securities in the event of a default under the
     repurchase agreement. The Fund monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the
     securities transferred to ensure that their value, including accrued
     interest, is greater than amounts owed to the Fund under each such
     repurchase agreement.

11   TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER FUNDS MANAGED BY NEUBERGER BERMAN MANAGEMENT INC.:
     Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange
     Commission, the Fund may invest in a money market fund managed by
     Management or an affiliate. The Fund invests in the Neuberger Berman Prime
     Money Fund ("Prime Money"), as approved by the Board. Prime Money seeks to
     provide the highest available current income consistent with safety and
     liquidity. For any cash that the Fund invests in Prime Money, Management
     waives a portion of its management fee equal to the management fee it
     receives from Prime Money on those assets (the "Arrangement"). For the six
     months ended April 30, 2006, management fees waived under this Arrangement
     amounted to $2,600 and are reflected in the Statement of Operations under
     the caption "Investment management fee waived." For the six months ended
     April 30, 2006, income earned under this Arrangement amounted to $135,649
     and is reflected in the Statement of Operations under the caption "Income
     from investments in affiliated issuers."

12   CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Under normal market conditions, the Fund's
     investments will be concentrated in income-producing common equity
     securities, preferred securities, convertible securities and
     non-convertible debt securities issued by companies deriving the majority
     of their revenue from the ownership, construction, financing, management
     and/or sale of commercial, industrial, and/or residential real estate. The
     value of the Fund's shares may fluctuate more due to economic, legal,
     cultural, geopolitical or technological developments affecting the United
     States real estate industry, or a segment of the United

                                       16
<Page>

     States real estate industry in which the Fund owns a substantial position,
     than would the shares of a fund not concentrated in the real estate
     industry.

13   INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Fund's organizational
     documents provide that its officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Fund. In addition, both in some of its principal service contracts and in
     the normal course of its business, the Fund enters into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against the Fund.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     The Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, the Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.60% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from the Fund at the following annual rates:

<Table>
<Caption>
      YEAR ENDED       % OF AVERAGE
     OCTOBER 31,   DAILY MANAGED ASSETS
     ----------------------------------
     <S>                   <C>
     2006 - 2008           0.25

         2010              0.13
         2011              0.07
</Table>

     Management has not contractually agreed to waive any portion of its fees
     beyond October 31, 2011.

     For the six months ended April 30, 2006, such waived fees amounted to
     $1,033,863.

     The Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement. The Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
     ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
     Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
     under the agreement.

     Management and Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), a member firm of the
     New York Stock Exchange and subadviser to the Fund, are wholly-owned
     subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. ("Lehman"), a publicly-owned
     holding company. Neuberger is retained by Management to furnish it with
     investment recommendations and research information without added cost to
     the Fund. Several individuals who are officers and/or Directors of the Fund
     are also employees of Neuberger and/or Management.

                                       17

     The Fund entered into a commission recapture program, which enables it to
     pay some of its operational expenses by recouping a portion of the
     commissions it pays to a broker that is not a related party of the Fund.
     Expenses paid through this program may include costs of custodial, transfer
     agency or accounting services. For the six months ended April 30, 2006, the
     impact of this arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $14,539.

     The Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its custodian
     contract. For the six months ended April 30, 2006, the impact of this
     arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $2,087.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, the Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by the Fund and the broker-dealer.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, the Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that the
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a
     minimum level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to
     maintain the AAA/Aaa rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the
     fact that the rating agencies require the Fund, in performing this
     calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face value, at
     rates determined by the rating agencies. The Fund pays a fee to State
     Street for the preparation of this report, which is reflected in the
     Statement of Operations under the caption "Basic maintenance expense."

     NOTE C--SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS:

     During the six months ended April 30, 2006, there were purchase and sale
     transactions (excluding short-term securities and interest rate swap
     contracts) of $81,227,478 and $70,587,872, respectively.

     During the six months ended April 30, 2006, brokerage commissions on
     securities transactions amounted to $196,735, of which Neuberger received
     $14, Lehman Brothers Inc. received $30,363, and other brokers received
     $166,358.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of the Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under the Fund's distribution reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may
     be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment returns may
     fluctuate and shares when sold may be worth more or less than original
     cost. Total return would have been lower if Management had not waived a
     portion of the investment management fee.

#    The Fund is required to calculate an expense ratio without taking into
     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.

++   After waiver of a portion of the investment management fee by Management.
     Had Management not undertaken such action, the annualized ratios of net
     expenses to average daily net assets applicable to common shareholders
     would have been:

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the
Distribution Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current
Shares are registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as
of the first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the payment date, to apply the
amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares (less their
PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend or distribution except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day
during the purchase period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than
the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent
will not make any further open-market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of such dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases
during the purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to
the uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue
new Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the
purchase period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net
asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus
estimated brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the
terms specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the reinvestment purchase comparison under the Plan, (a)
the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last sales
price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are principally
traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or if not so
listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean between the
closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on such date
and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be the net
asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund. All
dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or Shares)
shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.


                                       22

<Page>

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
Participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF NEUBERGER BERMAN FUNDS

I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

This code of ethics ("Code") for the registered investment companies within the
Neuberger Berman Fund complex (each, a "Company") applies to each Company's
Principal Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal
Accounting Officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is listed in Exhibit
A). The purpose of the Code is to promote:

     o   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

     o   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that a Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Company;

     o   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o   the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to  an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o   accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL, POTENTIAL AND APPARENT
     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual,
potential and apparent conflicts of interest.

     An "actual conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a
result of his or her position with the Company.

     A "potential conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest is such that it might, under certain circumstances, interfere with the
interests of the Company or the Officer's service to the Company, but those
circumstances do not now exist.


<PAGE>

     Appearances may create an "apparent conflict of interest" even when an
actual conflict does not exist. For example, an apparent conflict may exist if a
Covered Officer owns a thinly traded security that a series of a Company (a
"Fund") is buying, even if there is no actual conflict of interest.

     Certain actual or potential conflicts of interest may arise out of the
relationships between Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject
to conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940
("Investment Company Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in
certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other
property) with a Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the
Company. The compliance programs and procedures of Neuberger Berman Management
Inc., Neuberger Berman, LLC (collectively referred to as the "investment
adviser") and each Company are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace these programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside
of the parameters of this Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, actual or potential conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the
contractual relationship between the Company and the investment adviser of which
the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code
recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether formally for the Company or for the investment adviser, or for both),
be involved in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have
different effects on the adviser and the Company. The participation of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship
between the Company and the investment adviser and is consistent with the
performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Company.
Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Companies' Boards of
Trustees/Directors ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that the personal interest
of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the interest of the
Company. The following list provides examples of conflicts of interest under the
Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these examples are not
exhaustive.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     o   use his or her personal influence or personal relationships  improperly
         to  influence  investment  decisions  or  financial  reporting  by  the

                                        2
<PAGE>

         Company,  as for  example  where  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
         personally to the detriment of the Company;

     o   cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit the Company;

     o   retaliate against any other Covered Officer, or any employee of a
         Company, its service providers, or the affiliated persons of any of
         them, for good faith reports of potential violations of this Code.

     There are some actual or potential conflict of interest situations that
should always be approved by the Company's Chief Legal Officer1 if material.
Covered Officers are encouraged to discuss with the Chief Legal Officer any
potential conflict the materiality of which is uncertain. Examples of reportable
conflicts include:

     o   service as a director on the board of any public or private company,
         other than the Companies, their investment adviser, and its affiliates;

     o   the  receipt of any non-nominal  gifts,  i.e., those in excess of $100;

     o   the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the
         Company has current or prospective business dealings unless such
         entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
         to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
         impropriety;

     o   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
         with, any of the Company's service providers, other than its investment
         adviser or any affiliated person thereof; and

     o   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
         charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting portfolio
         transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
         arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
         equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o   Each Covered Officer must familiarize himself or herself with the
         disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company and the
         Company's Disclosure Controls and Procedures;

     o   each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
         to misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or
         outside the Company, including to the Company's trustees/directors and
         auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
         organizations;

- ----------------
1    The Board of each  Company has  appointed Maxine L. Gerson as  Chief Legal
     Officer.

                                        3
<PAGE>

     o   each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
         her area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
         of the Companies and the adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
         accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
         documents the Companies file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
         public communications made by the Companies; and

     o   each Covered Officer should promote compliance with the standards and
         restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.  Reporting and Accountability

         Each Covered Officer must:

     o   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he or she has
         received, read, and understands the Code;

     o   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied
         with the requirements of the Code;

     o   report on the Company's Questionnaire for Trustees/Directors and
         Officers, where responsive to appropriate questions, all categories of
         affiliations or other relationships giving rise to actual or potential
         conflicts of interest; and

     o   notify the Chief Legal Officer promptly if he or she is aware of facts
         and circumstances that he or she knows are a violation of this Code.
         Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

     The Chief Legal Officer is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation.2 However, any approvals or
waivers3 sought by the Principal Executive Officer will be considered by the
Independent Trustees/ Directors of the affected Company (the "Committee").

- ----------------
2    The Chief Legal Officer is authorized to consult, as appropriate, with
     counsel to the Company and counsel to the Independent Trustees/Directors,
     and is encouraged to do so.
3    Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
     waiver" as "the registrant's failure to take action within a reasonable
     period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the code
     of ethics that has been made known to an executive officer" of the
     registrant. Both waivers and implicit waivers must be disclosed publicly.


                                        4
<PAGE>

     The Companies will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any potential violations reported to him or her.

     o   The Chief Legal Officer will report to the Committee the outcome of the
         investigation, including the facts of the initial report, the scope and
         outcome of the investigation, and whether or not the Chief Legal
         Officer believes that a violation occurred.

     o   The person who initially reported the matter will be informed that the
         matter has been investigated and reported to the Committee.

     o   If the Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will inform
         and make a recommendation to the Board, which will consider appropriate
         action, which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
         applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate
         personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation
         to dismiss the Covered Officer.

     o The Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate.

     o   Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Companies for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Companies, the investment adviser, the Companies'
principal underwriter, or other service providers purport to apply a lesser
standard to the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Companies' and the investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act and the investment
adviser's more detailed policies and procedures set forth in Neuberger Berman
Management Inc.'s Compliance Manual are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not preempted by this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of
Independent Trustees/Directors.

                                        5
<PAGE>

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Company, its Board (and any
Committee of the Board) and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for internal use by the Companies and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
