PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period. The Trust's advisor has waived or reimbursed fees and
expenses from time to time; absent such waivers/reimbursements the Trust's
returns would have been lower.

The Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based
statistical composite of Pennsylvania municipal bonds. The index is unmanaged
and does not include any sales charges or fees. Such costs would lower
performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2007

MARKET CONDITIONS

The overall environment for municipal bonds was favorable during the reporting
period, but mixed economic indicators and concerns about the residential housing
sector led to increased market uncertainty and volatility. At the beginning of
the period, the pace of economic growth appeared to be slowing, but in December,
the outlook for the economy turned positive following a slate of
stronger-than-expected economic releases. The improved economic picture pushed
bond yields higher and effectively reversed the run-up in prices that had begun
in July on concern over the weak housing market's potential drag on the economy.
Bonds continued to decline until February, when the sub-prime mortgage market
showed signs of deterioration, causing a sell-off in equities and a
flight-to-quality bond market rally. In March, the rally ended as strong
employment reports and upward movement in inflationary pressures sparked selling
in an overbought Treasury market. At month end, however, the short end of the
bond market rebounded strongly following news that the Federal Open Market
Committee (the "Fed") had dropped its bias toward higher rates. This came as
somewhat of a surprise, given the fact that core inflation readings remained
elevated.

Municipal bond yields followed the general movement of the Treasury market.
However, the 30-year AAA municipal yield reached lows not seen in decades,
declining to 4.00 percent in the first half of the reporting period before
reversing course and ending the period higher at 4.10 percent. Yields on the
short end of the municipal curve rose more than long-term yields during the
period. As a result, the short end of the curve posted the lowest returns while
the long end outperformed other portions of the curve by as much as 70 basis
points. The slope of the municipal curve (which is defined by the traditional
yield advantage of bonds with longer maturities) still remained relatively flat
and as such, the yield differential between long maturity and short maturity
issues was quite small.

New issue supply rose dramatically during the period, increasing by 34 percent
versus the same six-month period a year ago, as relatively low interest rates
spurred municipalities to refinance their debt. Demand for municipal bonds was
robust as well, particularly for high-yield securities as investors proved
increasingly willing to take on more risk in return for relatively higher
yields. The strong demand caused most credit spreads, which were already near
historically tight levels, to further narrow. As a result, the lower-quality,
higher yielding segment of the market considerably outperformed, returning 182
basis points more than the investment-grade segment for the overall period.

Municipal bond issuance by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania rose during the
period and higher education bonds continued to represent a significant portion

 2
<PAGE>

of the new issue supply. As was the case for the municipal market overall, the
large supply of municipal bonds and the low interest-rate environment led to a
high amount of advance refundings, wherein new bonds are issued to repay an
outstanding bond issue prior to its stated maturity. The state's economy
continued to grow at a steady pace and its credit outlook remains stable.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On an NAV basis, the Trust outperformed its benchmark index, the Lehman
Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index. On a market price basis, the Trust
also outperformed its benchmark.

and index definition.

A variety of strategies drove the Trust's performance during the course of the
period. One of the key drivers was our focus on the long end of the yield curve.
Given the relatively flat shape of the curve throughout the period, we invested
in bonds with maturities of 25 years or more in order to capture more attractive
yields. These purchases were funded by the proceeds from the sale of bonds in
the intermediate portion of the curve that had low acquisition yields as well as
by bonds that were pre-refunded. The emphasis on longer-maturity issues proved
beneficial to performance as this segment of the curve outperformed for the
overall period.

Additionally, in an effort to further enhance yield, we added to the Trust's
holdings of inverse floating-rate securities.* This strategy was additive to the
Trust's performance during the first four months of the period. In the last two
months, however, rising interest rates hurt the performance of inverse floating-
rate securities. As a result, the Trust's holdings in these credits detracted
from

*An inverse floating-rate security, or "inverse floater", is a variable rate
security whose coupon rate changes in the opposite direction from the change in
the reference rate used to calculate the coupon rate.
                                                                               3
<PAGE>

performance late in the period. Another detractor from overall performance was
the Trust's holdings within the education sector, which was primarily due to the
fact that the portfolio had comparatively fewer bonds than the Lehman Brothers
Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index that were refunded during the period. Security
selection within the health care sector also hindered relative returns.

Because the Trust's inverse floating-rate securities effectively added to the
portfolio's duration (a measure of interest-rate risk), we hedged that risk by
selling 10- and 30-year U.S. Treasury futures. This strategy was additive to
performance for the overall period and served to keep the Trust's duration
neutral to that of the Lehman Brothers Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index. The
Trust also benefited from strong security selection within the transportation
sector, particularly in airport bonds, as well as within the utilities sector,
which enjoyed strong performance. The Trust remained well diversified across a
broad spectrum of municipal market sectors. As of the end of the period,
hospital, higher education and public education bonds represented the
portfolio's largest sector weightings.

The Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the trust may, when appropriate,
repurchase its shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
at a price not above market value or NAV, whichever is lower at the time of
purchase. This may help support the market value of the trust's shares.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Trust in
the future.

VAN KAMPEN PENNSYLVANIA VALUE MUNICIPAL INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Pennsylvania Value Municipal Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered
as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended but operates as a
diversified management investment company. The Trust's investment objective is
to seek to provide a high level of current income exempt from federal and
Pennsylvania income taxes and, where possible under local law, local income and
personal property taxes, consistent with preservation of capital. The Trust will
invest substantially all of its assets in Pennsylvania municipal securities
rated investment grade at the time of investment, but may invest up to 20% of
its assets in unrated securities which are believed to be of comparable quality
to those rated investment grade. The Trust commenced investment operations on
April 30, 1993.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the last reported bid and asked prices or, in the
absence of market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to
municipal bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions.
Securities which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are
valued at fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of
Trustees. Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each
day on the exchange on which they are traded. Interest rate swaps are valued
using market quotations obtained from brokers. Short-term securities with
remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At April 30, 2007, the Trust had $10,000,000 of when-issued or
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

                                                                              23

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed at least annually on a pro rata basis to common and
preferred shareholders. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes
may include short-term capital gains and a portion of futures gains, which are
included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended October 31,
2006 was as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>

  Ordinary income...........................................  $   294,810
  Tax-exempt income.........................................   23,223,650
  Long-term capital gain....................................    1,103,706

                                                              $24,622,166
                                                              ===========
</Table>

    As of October 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                           <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $114,587
Undistributed tax-exempt income.............................   390,577
Undistributed long-term capital gain........................   162,938
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of gains or losses recognized on securities for
tax purposes, but not for book.

F. FLOATING RATE NOTE OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SECURITIES HELD The Trust enters
into transactions in which it transfers to dealer trusts fixed rate bonds in
exchange for cash and residual interests in the dealer trusts' assets and cash
flows, which are in the form of inverse floating rate investments. The dealer
trusts fund the purchases of the fixed rate bonds by issuing floating rate notes
to third parties and allowing the Trust to retain residual interests in the
bonds. The Trust enters into shortfall agreements with the dealer trusts, which
commit the Trust to pay the dealer trusts, in certain circumstances, the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed rate bonds held by the
dealer trusts and the liquidation value of the floating rate notes held by third
parties, as well as any shortfalls in interest cash flows. The residual
interests held by the Trust (inverse floating rate investments) include the
right of the Trust (1) to cause the holders of the floating rate notes to tender
their notes at par at the next interest rate reset date, and (2) to transfer the
municipal bond from the dealer trusts to the Trust, thereby collapsing the
dealer trusts. The Trust accounts for the transfer of bonds to the dealer trusts
as secured borrowings, with the securities transferred remaining in the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

Trust's investment assets, and the related floating rate notes reflected as
Trust liabilities under the caption "Floating Rate Note Obligations" on the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The Trust records the interest income from
the fixed rate bonds under the caption "Interest" and records the expenses
related to floating rate note obligations and any administrative expenses of the
dealer trusts under the caption "Interest and Residual Trust Expenses" on the
Trust's Statement of Operations. The notes issued by the dealer trusts have
interest rates that reset weekly and the floating rate note holders have the
option to tender their notes to the dealer trusts for redemption at par at each
reset date. At April 30, 2007, Trust investments with a value of $217,238,681
are held by the dealer trusts and serve as collateral for the $161,130,000 in
floating rate notes outstanding at that date. Contractual maturities of the
floating rate notes and interest rates in effect at April 30, 2007 are presented
on the Portfolio of Investments.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") will provide investment advice and facilities to the
Trust for an annual fee payable monthly of .55% of the average daily net assets
including preferred shares of the Trust. Effective December 1, 2006, the Adviser
has agreed to waive investment advisory fees equal to .10% of the average daily
net assets including preferred shares of the Trust. During the period ended
April 30, 2007, the Adviser waived $253,316 of its advisory fees. This waiver is
voluntary and can be discontinued at any time.

    For the six months ended April 30, 2007, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $25,000 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, Accounting Services and Chief Compliance
Officer (CCO) Employment agreements, the Adviser provides accounting and legal
services and the CCO provides compliance services to the Trust. The costs of
these services are allocated to each trust. For the six months ended April 30,
2007, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $31,900 representing Van
Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, as well as the salary,
benefits and related costs of the CCO and related support staff paid by Van
Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal Services agreement are reported
as part of "Professional Fees" on the Statement of Operations. Services provided
pursuant to the Accounting Services and CCO Employment agreement are reported as
part of "Accounting and Administrative Expenses" on the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

                                                                              25

* On February 28, 2007, the Trust commenced a share repurchase program for
purposes of enhancing stockholder value and reducing the discount at which the
Trust's shares trade from their net asset value. For the period ended April 30,
2007, the Trust repurchased 97,550 of its shares at an average discount of
7.792% from net asset value per share. The Trust expects to continue to
repurchase its outstanding shares at such time and in such amounts as it
believes such activity will further the accomplishment of the foregoing
objectives, subject to review of the Trustees.

    On December 2, 2005, the Trust acquired all of the assets and liabilities of
the Van Kampen Advantage Pennsylvania Municipal Income Trust (ticker symbol
VAP), Pennsylvania Quality Municipal Income Trust (ticker symbol VPQ) and Trust
for Investment Grade Pennsylvania Municipals (ticker symbol VTP) through a tax
free reorganization approved by VAP, VPQ and VTP shareholders on November 22,
2005. The Trust issued 20,131,138 common shares with a net asset value of
$317,870,416 and 7,000 Auction Preferred Shares (APS) with a liquidation value
of $175,000,000 in exchange for VAP's, VPQ's, and VTP's net assets. The shares
of VAP were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of 1.005624 to 1 and 1 to 1,
for common shares and APS, respectively. The shares of VPQ were converted into
Trust shares at a ratio of 1.002660 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS,
respectively. The shares of VTP were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of
1.002103 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS, respectively. Net
unrealized appreciation of VAP, VPQ and VTP as of December 2, 2005 was
$22,548,134. The Trust assumed VAP, VPQ, and VTP's book to tax accretion
differences, which resulted in a $409,362 increase to accumulated undistributed
net investment income and a corresponding decrease to net unrealized
appreciation. Combined net assets applicable to common shares on the day of
reorganization were $388,563,174 and combined net assets including preferred
shares were $608,563,174. Included in these net assets was a deferred
compensation and retirement plan balance of $770,770 which is included with
accumulated undistributed net investment income. Additionally, included in these
net assets were gains or losses of $181,794 recognized for tax purposes on open
futures transactions at December 2, 2005, which are included with accumulated
net realized gain. The Trust incurred merger expenses of $340,753, which
represent costs related to the preparation, printing, and distribution of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Reorganization Agreement and registration statements
as well as legal, audit, and filing fees.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $193,825,289 and $65,397,117,
respectively.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    In order to seek to manage the interest rate exposure of the Trust's
portfolio in a changing interest rate environment, the Trust may purchase or
sell financial futures contracts or engage in transactions involving interest
rate swaps, caps, floors or collars. The Trust expects to enter into these
transactions primarily as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or
fixed-income market changes, for duration management or for risk management
purposes, but may also enter into these transactions to generate additional
income. All of the Trust's portfolio holdings, including derivative instruments,
are marked to market each day with the change in value reflected in the
unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Upon disposition, a realized gain or loss
is recognized accordingly, except when taking delivery of a security underlying
a futures contract. In this instance, the recognition of gain or loss is
postponed until the disposal of the security underlying the futures contract.

    Summarized below are the specific types of derivative financial instruments
used by the Trust.

A. FUTURES CONTRACTS A futures contract is an agreement involving the delivery
of a particular asset on a specified future date at an agreed upon price. The
Trust generally invests in exchange traded futures contracts on U.S. Treasury
securities and typically closes the contract prior to the delivery date. These
contracts are generally used to manage the Trust's effective maturity and
duration. Upon entering into futures contracts, the Trust maintains an amount of
cash or liquid securities with a value equal to a percentage of the contract
amount with either a futures commission merchant pursuant to the rules and
regulations promulgated under the 1940 Act, as amended, or with its custodian in
an account in the broker's name. This amount is known as initial margin. During
the period the futures contract is open, payments are received from or made to
the broker based upon changes in the value of the contract (the variation
margin). The risk of loss associated with a futures contract is in excess of the
variation margin reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

    Transactions in futures contracts for the six months ended April 30, 2007
were as follows:

</Table>

B. INTEREST RATE SWAPS The Trust may enter into forward interest rate swap
transactions intended to help the Trust manage its overall interest rate
sensitivity, either shorter or longer, generally to more closely align the
Trust's interest rate sensitivity with that of the broader

                                                                              27

municipal market. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve the Trust's
agreement with a counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or variable rate
payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Trust a variable or fixed
rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a specified date in the
future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment obligation is based on
the notional amount of the forward swap contract and the termination date of the
swap (which is akin to a bond's maturity). The value of the Trust's swap
commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the extent to which
long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the swap's termination
date increases or decreases. The Trust may terminate a swap contract prior to
the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss is recognized. When a
forward swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not involve the delivery of
securities or other underlying assets or principal, but rather is settled in
cash on a net basis. The Trust intends, but is not obligated, to terminate its
forward swaps before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of loss with
respect to the swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to the credit
risk associated with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment to pay any
realized gain to the Trust upon termination. To reduce such credit risk, all
counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based on the daily
valuation of each swap) on behalf of the Trust with a value approximately equal
to the amount of any unrealized gain. Reciprocally, when the Trust has an
unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Trust has instructed the custodian to
pledge cash or liquid securities as collateral with a value approximately equal
to the amount of the unrealized loss. Collateral pledges are monitored and
subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations fluctuate. Restricted
cash, if any, for segregating purposes is shown on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities.

C. INVERSE FLOATING RATE INVESTMENTS The Trust may invest a portion of its
assets in inverse floating rate instruments, either through outright purchases
of inverse floating rate securities or through the transfer of bonds to a dealer
trust in exchange for cash and residual interests in the dealer trust. These
investments are typically used by the Trust in seeking to enhance the yield of
the portfolio. These instruments typically involve greater risks than a fixed
rate municipal bond. In particular, these instruments are acquired through
leverage or may have leverage embedded in them and therefore involve many of the
risks associated with leverage. Leverage is a speculative technique that may
expose the Trust to greater risk and increased costs. Leverage may cause the
Trust's net asset value to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged
because leverage tends to magnify the effect of any increases or decreases in
the value of the Trust's portfolio securities. The use of leverage may also
cause the Trust to liquidate portfolio positions when it may not be advantageous
to do so in order to satisfy its obligations with respect to inverse floating
rate instruments.

6. PREFERRED SHARES

As of April 30, 2007, the Trust has outstanding 8,800 APS. Series A contains
1,800 shares, Series B contains 1,600 shares, Series C contains 2,600 shares,
and Series D contains 2,800 shares. Dividends are cumulative and the dividend
rates are generally reset every 7 days for Series A, while Series B, Series C,
and Series D are generally reset every 28 days through an auction process. The
average rate in effect on April 30, 2007 was 3.757%. During the six months ended
April 30, 2007, the rates ranged from 3.260% to 4.690%.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED) continued

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

8. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an
interpretation of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting
for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position
must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. Recent SEC guidance
allows implementing FIN 48 in the trust's NAV calculations as late as the
trust's last NAV calculation in the first required financial statement period.
As a result, the Trust will incorporate FIN 48 in its semi annual report on
April 30, 2008. The impact to the Trust's financial statements, if any, is
currently being assessed.

    In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Trust's financial statement disclosures.

                                                                              29

     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for

     a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     b)   designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
