                               SHAREHOLDER LETTER

                                NOVEMBER 30, 2004

To the Shareholders of the Clough Global Allocation Fund:

This letter addresses the strategies we use to manage the Clough Global
Allocation Fund and provides our initial outlook towards investing in 2005.

The Fund began investing on July 29, 2004 and has seen four months of activity.
We are pleased with the Fund's performance to date. The Fund's offering price on
July 28, 2004 was $20 per share and it never closed below that level. The
closing market price for the period ended November 30, 2004, was $21.10 per
share. In addition, the Fund paid a $0.30 per share cash distribution on October
29, 2004, the first quarterly installment in what is planned to be a 6% annual
managed distribution. The net asset value at period-end was $20.44 per share, up
from $19.10 at inception. During the period, shares of the Fund consistently
sold at a premium to net asset value.

There have been three overriding determinants of the Fund's investment
strategies. First, the Fund is an asset allocation fund, and we aggressively
manage its stock/bond mix. While most mutual funds are limited to investing in
either stocks or bonds, Clough Capital has the ability to seek out opportunity
in either asset class.

Second, on the equity side, the Fund has a definite theme focus. We seek to
invest in what we believe are the five or six most attractive investment themes
in the global markets. Three current examples of themes in which the Fund is
invested are noted below:

     a)   Our largest equity exposure is in North American natural gas
          exploration and production and the deep-water drilling equipment and
          service industries. On the surface this appears to be a popular market
          theme, but we think most investors have only a superficial
          appreciation for what is happening on the energy front. The big North
          American gas fields are depleting, reservoir levels are falling, and
          though the number of rigs operating in North America is 65% higher
          than 2 years ago, production of natural gas is actually down.
          According to the CEO of one deep water drilling company, for the first
          time in half a century, it will be necessary to develop completely new
          fields to access new gas supplies. Most new gas fields lie under 5,000
          feet of water and for that reason we are invested in both producers
          and companies which provide equipment and services for offshore
          drilling Currently, only 26 rigs exist in the world that are capable
          of drilling at depths of more than 5,000 feet of water. Yet, over the
          next 25 years the International Energy Agency estimates that $2.5
          trillion will be spent to develop these resources, so we believe the
          opportunity for the drilling industry is rather dramatic. That level
          of spending contrasts with a current market capitalization for all
          U.S. off-shore drilling companies which is a mere $38 billion. We
          expect some stock price volatility in this sector as perspectives of
          energy availability change, but we will try to take advantage of that
          if or when it occurs.

     b)   We are investing in a portfolio of small capitalization banks, looking
          forward to the consolidation which we believe will occur in the
          financial service industry. If the consolidation occurs as we expect,
          it is likely to benefit the stock prices of these institutions.

                                        2

     c) We hold a number of property/casualty insurance companies whose stocks
          sell at 7-8 times earnings which we believe offers good value. We
          believe it is highly likely that growing cash flows and limited
          opportunities for market share gains will force the industry to
          consolidate, materially strengthening its long-term profit outlook.

     Finally, the Fund also has a global mandate. As of November 30, 2004, more
     than 15% of the Fund's assets were invested outside the U.S. This strategy
     reflects our belief that higher returns will come from non-U.S. financial
     markets. Japan is the nucleus of our largest non-U.S. country focus. Japan
     has the second largest financial market in the world, and while most
     analysts argue over the sustainability of Japan's economic recovery, Japan
     is a huge corporate restructuring story. Japanese corporations are building
     cash balances and the proliferation of corporate merger activity and
     leveraged buyouts are beginning to change Japan's investment landscape.
     Business savings are soaring to the level of 25% of gross domestic product
     (GDP); Japanese businesses are de-leveraging, and as they do, equity
     holders may benefit. The potential opportunity is not unlike that which
     characterized the early 1980's in the U.S. when America's financial markets
     were inexpensive.

     The Fund should also benefit from any rise in the value of the Japanese yen
     relative to the U.S. dollar. Emerging markets will also be an important
     sector investment in 2005. Many emerging economies have restructured their
     financial sectors, enjoy strong current account surpluses and have viable
     sources of domestic demand growth. The Fund holds investments in both
     non-Japan Asia and Brazil, and we are beginning to examine investment in
     Eastern Europe.

     In 2005, we anticipate opportunities in selected market sectors and in
     several geographies. As of November 30, 2004, the Fund was evenly invested
     across stocks and fixed income securities, an asset allocation mix we have
     had for most of the Fund's life. Much of the Fund's fixed income focus for
     the moment is in shorter-dated U.S. fixed income securities. We suspect
     there is some latent strength in the economy and hope to lock in somewhat
     higher yields in coming months.

     Looking ahead, we see two major investment flows in the world and hope to
     capitalize on them. The U.S. is a big balance sheet economy. By that we
     mean that $50 trillion in financial assets, consisting of $35 trillion in
     bonds and $15 trillion in stocks, are supported by an economy which
     produces only $12 trillion in terms of dollar GDP. This is the key reason
     the financial markets in the aggregate will likely produce single digit
     annual returns in the year ahead. To enhance those market returns, we will
     attempt to exploit the movement of capital abroad by investing in what we
     believe to be the most promising non-U.S. markets. We also think that a
     massive transfer of wealth will occur from financial services, consumer
     services and technology, to energy and materials and industries leveraged
     to global trade. Finally, we will look for yield opportunities in the
     British, Canadian and Australian fixed income markets.

     Sincerely,

     /s/ Charles I. Clough, Jr.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                NOVEMBER 30, 2004

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND OPERATING POLICIES

Clough Global Allocation Fund is a closed-end management investment company (the
"Fund") that was organized under the laws of the state of Delaware by an
Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated April 27, 2004. The Fund is a
non-diversified series with an investment objective to provide a high level of
total return. The Declaration of Trust provides that the Trustees may authorize
separate classes of shares of beneficial interest.

The following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the Fund.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value per Share of the Fund is determined no
less frequently than daily, on each day that the American Stock Exchange (the
"Exchange") is open for trading, as of the close of regular trading on the
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. New York time). Trading may take place in foreign
issues held by the Fund at times when the Fund is not open for business. As a
result, the Fund's net asset value may change at times when it is not possible
to purchase or sell shares of the Fund. Securities held by the fund for which
exchange quotations are readily available are valued at the last sale price, or
if no sale price or if traded on the over-the-counter market, at the mean of the
bid and asked prices on such day. Over-the-counter securities traded on NASDAQ
are valued based upon the closing price. Debt securities for which the
over-the-counter market is the primary market are normally valued on the basis
of prices furnished by one or pricing services at the mean between the latest
available bid and asked prices. As authorized by the Trustees, debt securities
(other than short-term obligations) may be valued on the basis of valuations
furnished by a pricing service which determines valuations based upon market
transactions for normal, institutional-size trading units of securities.
Short-term obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost,
which approximates value, unless the Trustees determine that under particular
circumstances such method does not result in fair value. Over-the-counter
options are valued at the mean between bid and asked prices provided by dealers.
Financial futures contracts listed on commodity exchanges and exchange-traded
options are valued at closing settlement prices. Securities for which there is
no such quotation or valuation and all other assets are valued at fair value in
good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

FOREIGN SECURITIES: The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in foreign
securities. In the event that the Fund executes a foreign security transaction,
the Fund will generally enter into a forward foreign currency contract to settle
the foreign security transaction. Foreign securities may carry more risk than
U.S. securities, such as political, market and currency risks.

The accounting records of the Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars. Prices of
securities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at
the closing rates of exchange at period end. Amounts related to the purchase and
sale of foreign securities and investment income are translated at the rates of
exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.

The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments is
separately identified from the fluctuations arising from changes in market
values of securities held and reported with all other foreign currency gains and
losses in the Fund's Statement of Operations.

SHORT SALES: The Fund may sell a security it does not own in anticipation of a
decline in the fair value of that security. When the Fund sells a security
short, it must borrow the security sold short and deliver it to the
broker-dealer through which it made the short sale. A gain, limited to the price
at which the Fund sold the security short, or a loss, unlimited in size, will be
recognized upon the termination of the short sale.

                                       15

INCOME TAXES: The Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all
of its taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund intends to make a level dividend
distribution each quarter to Common Shareholders after payment of interest on
any outstanding borrowings or dividends on any outstanding preferred shares. The
level dividend rate may be modified by the Board of Trustees from time to
time. Any net capital gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually
to the extent necessary to avoid federal income and excise taxes. Distributions
to shareholders are recorded by the Fund on the ex- dividend date. The Fund has
applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an exemption from Section
19(b) of the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder permitting the Fund to make
periodic distributions of long-term capital gains, provided that the
distribution policy of the Fund with respect to its Common Shares calls for
periodic (e.g., quarterly/monthly) distributions in an amount equal to a fixed
percentage of the Fund's average net asset value over a specified period of time
or market price per common share at or about the time of distribution or pay-out
of a level dollar amount.

SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment security transactions
are accounted for as of trade date. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income, which includes amortization of premium and
accretion of discount, is accrued as earned. Realized gains and losses from
securities transactions and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
securities are determined using the highest cost basis for both financial
reporting and income tax purposes.

USE OF ESTIMATES: The Fund's financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

2. TAXES

Net investment income (loss) and net realized gain (loss) may differ for
financial statement and tax purposes. The character of distributions made during
the year from net investment income or net realized gains may differ from its
ultimate characterization for federal income tax purposes. Also, due to the
timing of dividend distributions, the fiscal year in which amounts are
distributed may differ from the fiscal year in which the income or realized gain
was recorded by the Fund.

NET UNREALIZED APPRECIATION/DEPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS BASED ON FEDERAL TAX
COSTS WERE AS FOLLOWS:

8,750,000 common shares in its initial public offering on July 28, 2004. These
common shares were issued at $20.00 per share before the underwriting discount

underwriter expenses of $.0067 per common share) that exceed $.04 per common
share.

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

                                NOVEMBER 30, 2004

Unless the registered owner of Common Shares elects to receive cash by
contacting The Bank of New York (the "Plan Administrator" or "BONY"), all
dividends declared on Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by the Plan
Administrator for shareholders in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
"Plan"), in additional Common Shares. Shareholders who elect not to participate
in the Plan will receive all dividends and other distributions in cash paid by
check mailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the Common Shares are
held in street or other nominee name, then to such nominee) by BONY as dividend
disbursing agent. You may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive
all dividends in cash by contacting BONY, as dividend disbursing agent, at the
address set forth below. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and
may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by notice if received
and processed by the Plan Administrator prior to the dividend record date;
otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with respect to any
subsequently declared dividend or other distribution. Some brokers may
automatically elect to receive cash on your behalf and may re-invest that cash
in additional Common Shares for you. If you wish for all dividends declared on
your Common Shares to be automatically reinvested pursuant to the Plan, please
contact your broker.

The Plan Administrator will open an account for each Common Shareholder under
the Plan in the same name in which such Common Shareholder's Common Shares are
registered. Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or other distribution
(together, a "Dividend") payable in cash, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in Common
Shares. The Common Shares will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for the
participants' accounts, depending upon the circumstances described below, either
(i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized Common Shares from the
Fund ("Newly Issued Common Shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding Common
Shares on the open market ("Open-Market Purchases") on the American Stock
Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the closing
market price plus estimated brokerage commissions per Common Share is equal to
or greater than the net asset value per Common Share, the Plan Administrator
will invest the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares on behalf of the
participants. The number of Newly Issued Common Shares to be credited to each
participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
Dividend by the net asset value per Common Share on the payment date; provided
that, if the net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the closing market
value on the payment date, the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by
95% of the closing market price per Common Share on the payment date. If, on the
payment date for any Dividend, the net asset value per Common Share is greater
than the closing market value plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Administrator will invest the Dividend amount in Common Shares acquired on
behalf of the participants in Open-Market Purchases. In the event of a market
discount on the payment date for any Dividend, the Plan Administrator will have
until the last business day before the next date on which the Common Shares
trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or 30 days after the payment date for such
Dividend, whichever is sooner (the "Last Purchase Date"), to invest the Dividend
amount in Common Shares acquired in Open-Market Purchases. If, before the Plan
Administrator has completed its Open-Market Purchases, the market price per
Common Share exceeds the net asset value per

<Page>

                                       19

Common Share, the average per Common Share purchase price paid by the Plan
Administrator may exceed the net asset value of the Common Shares, resulting in
the acquisition of fewer Common Shares than if the Dividend had been paid in
Newly Issued Common Shares on the Dividend payment date. Because of the
foregoing difficulty with respect to Open-Market Purchases, the Plan provides
that if the Plan Administrator is unable to invest the full Dividend amount in
Open-Market Purchases during the purchase period or if the market discount
shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Administrator
may cease making Open-Market Purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of
the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares at the net asset value per
Common Share at the close of business on the Last Purchase Date provided that,
if the net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the then current market
price per Common Share; the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by 95%
of the market price on the payment date.

The Plan Administrator maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including
information needed by shareholders for tax records. Common Shares in the account
of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator on behalf of the
Plan participant, and each shareholder proxy will include those shares
purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Administrator will forward
all proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares
held under the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants. In
the case of Common Shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees which hold
shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Administrator will
administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Common Shares certified from
time to time by the record shareholder's name and held for the account of
beneficial owners who participate in the Plan.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to Common Shares issued directly
by the Fund. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage
commissions incurred in connection with Open-Market Purchases. The automatic
reinvestment of Dividends will not relieve participants of any federal, state or
local income tax that may be payable (or required to be withheld) on such
Dividends. Participants that request a sale of Common Shares through the Plan
Administrator are subject to brokerage commissions.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants with regard to purchases in the Plan; however,
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants.

All correspondence or questions concerning the Plan should be directed to the
Plan Administrator, The Bank of New York, 101 Barclay Street, New York, New York
10286, 20th Floor, Transfer Agent Services,(800) 433-8191.

     2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
          statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
          necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
          under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
          the period covered by this report;

     3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
          information included in this report, fairly present in all material
          respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in
          net assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required
          to include a statement of cash flows) of the Registrant as of, and
          for, the periods presented in this report;

     4.   The Registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
          establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
          defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for
          the Registrant and have:

              a.  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused
                  such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under
                  our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
                  to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is
                  made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
                  during the period in which this report is being prepared;

              b.  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
                  controls and procedures and presented in this report our
                  conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
                  and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                  filing date of this report (the "Evaluation Date") based on
                  such evaluation; and

              c.  disclosed in the report any change in the Registrant's
                  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
                  the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
                  that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
                  materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over
                  financial reporting; and

     5.   The Registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based
          on our most recent evaluation, to the Registrant's auditors and the
          audit committee of the Registrant's board of directors (or persons
          performing the equivalent functions);

<Page>

              a.  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  Registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

              b.  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
                  or other employees who have a significant role in the
                  Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
