LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders,

[photo of Jeffrey L. Shames]

In our view, the past year has been a promising one for investors. Financial
markets have improved steadily, spurred by indications of a global economic
recovery.

These developments make this an encouraging time for MFS and for our
shareholders. But we also think it's a time to reinforce the fundamentals of a
sound investment strategy.

At MFS, we think in any market environment the best approach for investors is
disciplined diversification. This method of investing involves three simple
steps. First, allocate your holdings across the major asset classes. Second,
diversify within each class so that you get exposure to different investment
styles, such as growth and value, and market sectors, such as government and
corporate bonds. Finally, to respond to the way market activity can shift the
value of your accounts, rebalance your accounts on a routine schedule, such as
once per year. Doing so will help you maintain your desired allocation across
each asset class.

These investing fundamentals are often lost when markets are on an upswing. At
such times, it's easy to be tempted to shift your holdings into the current,
"hottest" performing investment. History suggests, however, that it is
difficult to predict year after year what the best performing sector or market
will be. While it is true that the past cannot offer any guarantees for the
future, the markets historically have demonstrated the benefits of taking the
prudent approach and spreading your assets across a variety of holdings. For
investors with long-term goals such as college or retirement, a balanced
approach usually makes the most sense. As always, your investment professional
can help you identify an appropriate mix of investments for your needs.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Jeffrey L. Shames

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MARKET ENVIRONMENT

The bond market for the 12 months ended November 30, 2003, was influenced by
accommodative worldwide monetary policies and low interest rates paid by
government bonds. As the global economies began to respond to stimulative
monetary policies, investors became less risk averse and turned toward
investments they had avoided in 2002.

Although global interest rates on November 30, 2003, were not that different
from what they had been in November of 2002, they were fairly volatile during
that 12-month period, especially in the summer months of 2003. For example,
the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond reached 3.10% in June 2003 - a four-decade low.
However, Treasury interest rates then rose from late June through August when
they reached 4.60% in September 2003. (Principal value and interest on
Treasury securities are guaranteed by the U.S. government if held to
maturity.)

TRUST POSITIONING

MFS Government Markets Income Trust is a high-quality portfolio that includes,
as a whole, primarily U.S. government bonds, mortgage-backed securities,
international government bonds, and emerging markets bonds.

The biggest shift in portfolio holdings was to reduce the trust's position in
mortgage-backed securities from nearly 46% in November of 2002 to 31% by
November of 2003. We also increased trust holdings in U.S. government agency
bonds. In both cases, those shifts occurred primarily in the summer months of
2003.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

The change we made in the trust's positioning detracted somewhat from
performance. Although the trust's government agency holdings provided positive
absolute returns for the period, returns from mortgage-backed securities were
higher. When mortgage rates rose during the summer months, prepayment activity
from refinancing slowed. Investors who were looking for better returns than
they could find on U.S. Treasury bonds turned to the higher yields offered by
mortgage-backed issues. Because we had reduced our mortgage holdings, the trust
did not participate fully in returns offered by that sector.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

International government bonds made a strong contribution to trust
performance, especially those from Germany, Spain, Austria, and Canada. The
trust's holdings in emerging markets debt was also a plus, as was its small,
unhedged currency position.

While 10-year U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly over the period, yields on
German, Spanish, Austrian, and Canadian government debt fell. As a result,
prices of those bonds appreciated. In Germany, relatively low inflation and a
weak economy contributed to the decline in yields. A combination of low
inflation and prudent fiscal policy led to the yield declines experienced in
the other three countries.

Emerging markets debt holdings comprised approximately 3% of the trust's
portfolio throughout the period ended November 30, 2003. Although our
allocation to the group was relatively small, it did contribute to trust
returns. As global economic conditions improved, investors returned to the
sector in their search for higher returns and that caused the value of these
securities to rise.

Trust performance also received a boost from currency appreciation on the
small portion of the portfolio - approximately 4% to 5% toward the end of the
period - that was invested in bonds denominated in foreign currency,
particularly the Euro. When the value of the Euro rose, the trust benefited
from that increase.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Peter C. Vaream

Note to Shareholders: Effective in May 2003, the JP Morgan Non-Dollar
Government Bond Index and Lehman Brothers Government Bond Index were replaced
as the trust's benchmarks by the Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Non-

Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Non-dollar Hedged Index subsequently
changed its name to the Citigroup World Government Bond Non-dollar Hedged
Index.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks
relating to interest rates, currency exchange rates, economic, and political
conditions.

The portfolio may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

Because the portfolio invests in a limited number of companies a change in
one security's value may have a more significant effect on the portfolio's
value.

Government guarantees apply to the underlying securities only and not to the
prices and yields of the portfolio.

These risks may increase share price volatility. Please see the prospectus for
further information regarding these and other risk considerations.

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on
such terms as the Trustees shall determine.
<PAGE>

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MFS offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows you to
reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the long-
term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that price
exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If the
shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted price
of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments in any amount
over $100 can be made in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.
When you withdraw, you can receive the value of the reinvested shares in one
of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional shares, or a
certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional shares.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the trust) is a non-diversified
Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

The trust can invest in foreign securities. Investments in foreign securities
are vulnerable to the effects of changes in the relative values of the local
currency and the U.S. dollar and to the effects of changes in each country's
legal, political, and economic environment.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Bonds and other fixed income securities (other than
short-term obligations) in the trust's portfolio are valued at an evaluated
bid price on the basis of quotes from brokers and dealers or on the basis of
valuations furnished by a pricing service. Prices obtained from pricing
services utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data
processing techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data without exclusive reliance upon quoted prices or exchange or over-the-
counter prices, since such valuations are believed to reflect more accurately
the fair value of such securities. Forward contracts will be valued using a
pricing model taking into consideration market data from an external pricing
source. Use of the pricing services has been approved by the Board of
Trustees. All other securities (other than short-term obligations), including
futures contracts in the trust's portfolio for which the principal market is
one or more securities or commodities exchanges (whether domestic or foreign)
will be valued at the last reported sale price or at the settlement price
prior to the determination (or if there has been no current sale, at the
closing bid price) on the primary exchange on which such securities are
traded; but if a securities exchange is not the principal market for
securities, such securities will, if market quotations are readily available,
be valued at current bid prices. Short-term obligations in the trust's
portfolio are valued at amortized cost, which constitutes fair value as
determined by the Board of Trustees. Short-term obligations with a remaining
maturity in excess of 60 days will be valued upon dealer-supplied valuations.
Investments in investment companies are valued at net asset value. The trust
values its portfolio securities at current market prices where current market
prices are readily available, or at fair value as determined under the
direction of the Board of Trustees when a determination is made that current
market prices are not readily available.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the trust's investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The trust
requires that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be
transferred to the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the trust to
obtain those securities in the event of a default under the repurchase
agreement. The trust monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral
to ensure that its value, including accrued interest, is greater than amounts
owed to the trust under each such repurchase agreement. The trust, along with
other affiliated entities of Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS),
may utilize a joint trading account for the purpose of entering into one or
more repurchase agreements.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Investment valuations, other assets, and
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are converted each
business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. Purchases
and sales of foreign investments, income, and expenses are converted into U.S.
dollars based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates
of such transactions. Gains and losses attributable to foreign currency
exchange rates on sales of securities are recorded for financial statement
purposes as net realized gains and losses on investments. Gains and losses
attributable to foreign exchange rate movements on income and expenses are
recorded for financial statement purposes as foreign currency transaction
gains and losses. That portion of both realized and unrealized gains and
losses on investments that results from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates is not separately disclosed.

FUTURES CONTRACTS -  The trust may enter into futures contracts for the
delayed delivery of securities or currency, or contracts based on financial
indices at a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the
trust is required to deposit with the broker either in cash or securities an
amount equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent
payments are made or received by the trust each day, depending on the daily
fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are recorded for financial
statement purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the trust. The trust's
investment in futures contracts is designed to hedge against anticipated
future changes in interest or exchange rates or securities prices. Investments
in interest rate futures for purposes other than hedging may be made to modify
the duration of the portfolio without incurring the additional transaction
costs involved in buying and selling the underlying securities. Investments in
currency futures for purposes other than hedging may be made to change the
trust's relative position in one or more currencies without buying and selling
portfolio assets. Investments in index contracts or contracts on related
options for purposes other than hedging, may be made when the trust has cash
on hand and wishes to participate in anticipated market appreciation while the
cash is being invested. Should interest or exchange rates or securities prices
move unexpectedly, the trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the
futures contracts and may realize a loss.

SECURITY LOANS - State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), as
lending agent, may loan the securities of the trust to certain qualified
institutions (the "Borrowers") approved by the trust. The loans are
collateralized at all times by cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities in an
amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned. State
Street provides the trust with indemnification against Borrower default. The
trust bears the risk of loss with respect to the investment of cash
collateral.

Cash collateral is invested in short-term securities. A portion of the income
generated upon investment of the collateral is remitted to the Borrowers, and
the remainder is allocated between the trust and the lending agent. On loans
collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, a fee is received from the
Borrower, and is allocated between the trust and the lending agent. Income
from securities lending is included in interest income on the Statement of
Operations. The dividend and interest income earned on the securities loaned
is accounted for in the same manner as other dividend and interest income.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties
to meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the
value of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The trust may enter
into forward foreign currency exchange contracts for hedging purposes as well
as for non-hedging purposes. For hedging purposes, the trust may enter into
contracts to deliver or receive foreign currency it will receive from or
require for its normal investment activities. The trust may also use contracts
in a manner intended to protect foreign currency-denominated securities from
declines in value due to unfavorable exchange rate movements. For non-hedging
purposes, the trust may enter into contracts with the intent of changing the
relative exposure of the trust's portfolio of securities to different
currencies to take advantage of anticipated changes. The forward foreign
currency exchange contracts are adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the
underlying currency and any gains or losses are recorded as unrealized until
the contract settlement date. On contract settlement date, the gains or losses
are recorded as realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium
and discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. All discount is accreted for tax reporting purposes as required by
federal income tax regulations. Dividends received in cash are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Dividend and interest payments received in additional
securities are recorded on the ex-dividend or ex-interest date in an amount
equal to the value of the security on such date. Some securities may be
purchased on a "when-issued" or "forward delivery" basis, which means that the
securities will be delivered to the trust at a future date, usually beyond
customary settlement time.

The trust may enter into TBA (to be announced) purchase commitments to
purchase securities for a fixed unit price at a future date. Although the unit
price has been established, the principal value has not been finalized.
However, the principal amount of the commitments will not fluctuate more than
1.0%. The trust holds, and maintains until settlement date, cash or high-grade
debt obligations in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase price, or the
trust may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other
securities it owns. Income on the securities will not be earned until
settlement date. TBA purchase commitments may be considered securities in
themselves, and involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be
purchased declines prior to settlement date, which is in addition to the risk
of decline in the value of the trusts' other assets. Unsettled TBA purchase
commitments are valued at the current market value of the underlying
securities, according to the procedures described under "Investment
Valuations" above. The trust may enter into TBA (to be announced) sale
commitments to hedge its portfolio positions or to sell mortgage-backed
securities it owns under delayed delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA sale
commitments are not received until the contractual settlement date. During the
time a TBA sale commitment is outstanding, equivalent deliverable securities,
or an offsetting TBA purchase commitment deliverable on or before the sale
commitment date, are held as "cover" for the transaction.

Legal fees and other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the
value of a security owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal
fees are expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the security issuer,
which are generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of
high-yield debt securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the
security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of
capital infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization
are reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance
an investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are
expensed.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by
the trust. This amount is shown as a reduction of total expenses on the
Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net taxable
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the
financial statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for currency transactions, mortgage-backed securities, derivatives,
defaulted bonds and amortization and accretion on debt securities.

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended
November 30, 2002 and November 30, 2003 was as follows:

                                     11/30/03              11/30/02
Distributions declared from:
- -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ordinary income                 $20,675,908           $24,666,472
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

During the year ended November 30, 2003, accumulated distributions in excess
of net investment income decreased by $4,863,365, accumulated net realized
loss on investments and foreign currency transactions increased by $1,358,890,
and paid-in capital decreased by $3,504,475 due to differences between book
and tax accounting for mortgage-backed securities, currency transactions,
amortization and accretion on debt securities and market discount. This change
had no effect on the net assets or net asset value per share.

At November 30, 2003, accumulated distributions in excess of net investment
income and net realized loss on investments and foreign currency
transactions under book accounting were different from tax accounting due to
temporary differences in accounting for mortgage-backed securities, currency
transactions, amortization and accretion on debt securities and market
discount.

As of November 30, 2003, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

      Capital loss carryforward                            $(24,722,985)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Unrealized appreciation                                 4,980,943
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Other temporary differences                            (2,380,875)
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

For federal income tax purposes, the capital loss carryforward may be applied
against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the
earlier of its utilization or expiration on:

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER -  The trust has an investment advisory agreement with
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS) to provide overall investment
advisory and administrative services, and general office facilities. The
management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an annual rate of 0.32%
of the trust's average daily net assets and 5.33% of investment income.

The trust pays compensation to the Independent Trustees ("Trustees") in the
form of both a retainer and attendance fees, and pays no compensation directly
to its Trustees who are officers of the investment adviser, or to officers of
the trust, all of whom receive remuneration for their services to the trust
from MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the trust are officers or directors
of MFS and MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC). The trust has an unfunded, defined
benefit plan for inactive Trustees and an unfunded retirement benefit deferral
plan for active Trustees. Included in Trustees' compensation is $5,957 as a
result of the change in the trust's unfunded retirement benefit deferral plan
for active Trustees and a pension expense of $14,899 for inactive Trustees for
the year ended November 30, 2003.

ADMINISTRATOR - The trust has an administrative services agreement with MFS to
provide the trust with certain financial, legal, shareholder communications,
compliance, and other administrative services. As a partial reimbursement for
the cost of providing these services, the trust pays MFS an administrative fee
not to exceed the following annual percentage rates of the trust's average
daily net assets:

      First $2 billion                                           0.0175%
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Next $2.5 billion                                          0.0130%

      In excess of $7 billion                                    0.0000%
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

TRANSFER AGENT - Included in transfer agent and dividend disbursing costs is a
fee paid to MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, for its services as
registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the trust. The agreement provides
that the trust will pay MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00
and a dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. These fees amounted to
$117,286 for the year ended November 30, 2003. MFSC is also reimbursed by the
trust for out-of-pocket expenses that amounted to $6,361 for the year ended
November 30, 2003.

</TABLE>

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other affiliated funds participate in an $800 million unsecured
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit
agreement. Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is
charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the bank's
base rate. A commitment fee of $2,949 which is based on the average daily
unused portion of the line of credit is included in miscellaneous expense. The
trust had no significant borrowings during the year.

(7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The trust trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the
normal course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to
market risks such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These
financial instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts, and
futures contracts. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments
represent the investment the trust has in particular classes of financial
instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject
to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is
meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

(8) CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE

As required, effective December 1, 2001, the trust adopted the provisions of
the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
amortizing premium on debt securities. Prior to December 1, 2001, the trust
did not amortize premium on debt securities. The cumulative effect of this
accounting change had no impact on total net assets of the trust, but resulted
in a $4,368,448 reduction in cost of securities and a corresponding $4,368,448
increase in net unrealized appreciation, based on securities held by the trust
on December 1, 2001.

The effect of this change for the year ended November 30, 2002 was to decrease
net investment income by $1,420,001, increase net unrealized appreciation by
$418,264, and increase net realized gains by $1,001,737. The Statement of
Changes in Net Assets and Financial Highlights for prior periods have not been
restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(9) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Massachusetts Financial Services Company ("MFS"), the trust's investment
adviser, has been contacted by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), the Office of the New York State Attorney General ("NYAG")
and the Bureau of Securities for the State of New Hampshire ("New Hampshire")
in connection with their investigations of practices in the mutual fund
industry identified as "market timing" mutual fund shares. MFS is cooperating
with respect to these investigations. MFS has been informed that the SEC, the
NYAG and New Hampshire are considering whether to institute enforcement
actions against MFS alleging false and misleading disclosure in certain MFS
fund prospectuses and breach of fiduciary duty concerning market timing. MFS
continues to discuss these matters with the SEC, the NYAG and New Hampshire.
Certain other regulatory authorities are also conducting investigations into
these practices within the industry and have requested that MFS provide
information to them.

Since December 2003, MFS and Sun Life Financial Inc., along with certain MFS
funds and Trustees who serve on the Board of Trustees of these MFS funds, have
been named as defendants in class action lawsuits filed in the United States
District Court, District of Massachusetts seeking damages of unspecified
amounts. The lawsuits were purportedly filed on behalf of people who
purchased, owned and/or redeemed shares of MFS funds during specified periods.
The suits allege that certain defendants permitted market timing and late
trading in the MFS funds which allegedly caused financial injury to the funds'
shareholders. The defendants are reviewing the allegations and will respond
appropriately. Additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations may be filed
in the future.

Any potential resolution of these matters may include, but not be limited to,
sanctions, penalties, damages or injunctions regarding MFS, restitution to
mutual fund shareholders and/or other financial penalties and structural
changes in the governance of MFS' mutual fund business.

These regulatory developments do not relate to closed-end investment companies
such as the trust. Although MFS does not believe that these lawsuits will have
a material adverse effect on the trust, there can be no assurance that the
ongoing adverse publicity and/or other developments resulting from related
regulatory investigations or developments will not result in an increase to
the market discount of the trust's shares or other adverse consequences to the
trust.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Government Markets Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of MFS
Government Markets Income Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of November 30, 2003, and the related statement of operations
for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of November 30, 2003, by correspondence with the custodian.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS
Government Markets Income Trust as of November 30, 2003, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The Trust holds annual shareholder meetings for the purpose of electing Trustees, and Trustees are elected for fixed
terms. The Board of Trustees is currently divided into three classes, each having a term of three years. Each year the
term of one class expires. Each Trustee's term of office expires on the date of the third annual meeting following the
election to office of the Trustee's class. Each Trustee will serve until next elected or his or her earlier death,
resignation, retirement or removal.

Messrs. Shames, Cohn, Sherratt and Smith, and Ms. O'Neill, have served in their capacity as Trustee of the Trust
continuously since originally elected or appointed. Messrs. Ballen, Gutow, Ives, Perera and Poorvu, and Ms. Smith, were
elected by shareholders and have served as Trustees of the Trust since January 1, 2002. Mr. Parke has served as a
Trustee of the Trust since January 1, 2002.

Each of the Trust's Trustees and officers holds comparable positions with certain other funds of which MFS or a
subsidiary is the investment adviser or distributor and, in the case of the officers, with certain affiliates of MFS.
Each Trustee serves as a board member of 110 funds within the MFS Family of Funds.

The Statement of Additional Information contains further information about the Trustees and is available without charge
upon request, by calling 1-800-225-2606.

The Board of Trustees and the Board of Managers of the investment companies
(the "MFS Funds") advised by Massachusetts Financial Services Company ("MFS")
have delegated to MFS the right and obligation to vote proxies for shares that
are owned by the MFS Funds, in accordance with MFS' proxy voting policies and
procedures (the "MFS Proxy Policies"). The MFS Proxy Policies are set forth
below:

                    MASSACHUSETTS FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                               SEPTEMBER 17, 2003

         Massachusetts Financial Services Company, MFS Institutional Advisors,
Inc. and MFS' other investment adviser subsidiaries (collectively, "MFS") have
adopted proxy voting policies and procedures, as set forth below, with respect
to securities owned by the clients for which MFS serves as investment adviser
and has the power to vote proxies, including the registered investment
companies included within the MFS Family of Funds (the "MFS Funds").

         These policies and procedures include:

                  A. Voting Guidelines;

                  B. Administrative Procedures;

                  C. Monitoring System;

                  D. Records Retention; and

                  E. Reports.

     A.  VOTING GUIDELINES

         1.       GENERAL POLICY; POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  MFS' policy is that proxy voting decisions are made in what
         MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
         clients, and not in the interests of any other party or in MFS'
         corporate interests, including interests such as the distribution of
         MFS Fund shares, administration of 401(k) plans, and institutional
         relationships.

                  MFS has carefully reviewed matters that in recent years have
         been presented for shareholder vote by either management or
         shareholders of public companies. Based on the guiding principle that
         all votes made by MFS on behalf of its clients must be in what MFS
         believes to be the best long-term economic interests of such clients,
         MFS has adopted proxy voting guidelines, which are set forth below,
         that govern how MFS generally plans to vote on specific matters
         presented for shareholder vote. In all cases, MFS will exercise its
         discretion to vote these items in accordance with this guiding
         principle. These underlying guidelines are simply that - guidelines.
         Each proxy item is considered on a case-by-case basis, in light of all
         relevant facts and circumstances, and there may be instances in which
         MFS may vote proxies in a manner different from these guidelines.

                  As a general matter, MFS maintains a consistent voting
         position with respect to similar proxy proposals made by various
         issuers. In addition, MFS generally votes consistently on the same
         matter when securities of an issuer are held by multiple client
         accounts. However, MFS recognizes that there are gradations in certain
         types of proposals that might result in different voting positions
         being taken with respect to the different proxy statements. There also
         may be situations involving matters presented for shareholder vote
         that are not clearly governed by the guidelines, such as proposed
         mergers and acquisitions. Some items that otherwise would be
         acceptable will be voted against the proponent when it is seeking
         extremely broad flexibility without offering a valid explanation. MFS
         reserves the right to override the guidelines with respect to a
         particular shareholder vote when such an override is, in MFS' best
         judgment, consistent with the guiding principle of voting proxies in
         the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients.

                  From time to time, MFS receives comments on these guidelines
         and regarding particular voting issues from its clients. Those
         comments are reviewed and considered periodically, and these
         guidelines are reviewed each year with MFS Equity Research Department
         management, the MFS Proxy Review Group and the MFS Proxy Consultant
         and are revised as appropriate.

                  These policies and procedures are intended to address any
         potential material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its
         affiliates that could arise in connection with the voting of proxies
         on behalf of MFS' clients. MFS shall be mindful of any and all
         potential material conflicts of interest that could arise in the
         voting of these proxies, shall identify, analyze, document and report
         on any such potential conflicts, and shall ultimately vote these
         proxies in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic
         interests of its clients. The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible
         for monitoring and reporting on all potential conflicts of interest.

         2.       MFS' POLICY ON SPECIFIC ISSUES

              NON-SALARY COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

                  Managements have become increasingly creative and generous
         with compensation programs involving common stock. The original stock
         option plans, which called for the optionee to pay the money to
         exercise the option, are now embellished with no risk benefits such as
         stock appreciation rights, the use of unexercised options to "buy"
         stock, and restricted stock at bargain prices.

                  Stock option plans are supposed to reward results rather than
         tenure, so the use of restricted stock at bargain prices is not
         favored. In some cases, restricted stock is granted to the recipient
         at deep discounts to fair market value, sometimes at par value. The
         holder cannot sell for a period of years, but in the meantime is able
         to vote and receive dividends. Eventually the restrictions lapse and
         the stock can be sold.

                  MFS votes against option programs for officers, employees or
         non-employee directors that do not require an investment by the
         optionee, that give "free rides" on the stock price, or that permit
         grants of restricted stock at deep discounts to fair market value. MFS
         generally votes against stock option plans that involve stock
         appreciation rights or the use of unexercised options to "buy" stock.

                  MFS opposes plans that provide unduly generous compensation
         for officers, directors or employees, or could result in excessive
         dilution to other shareholders. As a general guideline, MFS votes
         against stock option plans if all such plans for a particular company
         involve potential dilution, in the aggregate, of more than 15%.

                  MFS votes in favor of stock option plans for non-employee
         directors as long as they satisfy the requirements set forth above
         with respect to stock option plans for employees. Stock option plans
         that include options for consultants and other third parties not
         involved in the management of the company generally are opposed by
         MFS.

                  "GOLDEN PARACHUTES"

                  From time to time, shareholders of companies have submitted
         proxy proposals that would require shareholder approval of any
         severance packages for executive officers that exceed certain
         predetermined thresholds. MFS votes in favor of such shareholder
         proposals when they would require shareholder approval of any
         severance package for an executive officer that exceeds a certain
         percentage of such officer's annual compensation. When put to a vote,
         MFS votes against very large golden parachutes.

                  ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES

                  In general, MFS votes against any measure that inhibits
         capital appreciation in a stock, including a possible takeover and any
         proposal that protects management from action by shareholders. These
         types of proposals take many forms, ranging from "poison pills" and
         "shark repellents" to board classification and super-majority
         requirements.

                  REINCORPORATION AND REORGANIZATION PROPOSALS

                  When presented with a proposal to reincorporate a company
         under the laws of a different state, or to effect some other type of
         corporate reorganization, MFS considers the underlying purpose and
         ultimate effect of such a proposal in determining whether or not to
         support such a measure. While MFS generally votes in favor of
         management proposals that it believes are in the best long-term
         economic interests of its clients, MFS may oppose such a measure if,
         for example, the intent or effect would be to create additional
         inappropriate impediments to possible acquisitions or takeovers.

                  DILUTION

                  There are many reasons for issuance of stock and most are
         legitimate. As noted above under "Non-Salary Compensation Programs",
         when a stock option plan (either individually or when aggregated with
         other plans of the same company) would substantially dilute the
         existing equity (e.g., by approximately 15% or more), MFS generally
         votes against the plan. In addition, MFS votes against proposals where
         management is asking for authorization to issue common or preferred
         stock with no reason stated (a "blank check") because the unexplained
         authorization could work as a potential anti-takeover device.

                  CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

                  MFS votes in favor of proposals to ensure that shareholder
         voting results are kept confidential. For example, MFS supports
         proposals that would prevent management from having access to
         shareholder voting information that is compiled by an independent
         proxy tabulation firm.

                  INDEPENDENCE OF BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES THEREOF

                  While MFS acknowledges the potential benefits of a company's
         inclusion of directors who are "independent" from management, MFS
         generally opposes shareholder proposals that would require that a
         majority (or a "super-majority") of a company's board be comprised of
         "independent" directors. Such proposals could inappropriately reduce a
         company's ability to engage in certain types of transactions, could
         result in the exclusion of talented directors who are not deemed
         "independent", or could result in the unnecessary addition of
         additional "independent" directors to a company's board. However, in
         view of the special role and responsibilities of various the audit
         committees of a board of directors, MFS supports proposals that would
         require that the Audit, Nominating and Compensation Committees be
         comprised entirely of directors who are deemed "independent" of the
         company.

                  INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

                  Recently, some shareholder groups have submitted proposals to
         limit the non-audit activities of a company's audit firm. Some
         proposals would prohibit the provision of any non-audit services
         (unless approved in advance by the full board) whereas other proposals
         would cap non-audit fees so that such fees do not exceed a certain
         percentage of the audit fees. MFS supports such shareholder proposals
         that would cap non-audit fees at an amount deemed to be not excessive.

                  BEST PRACTICES STANDARDS

                  Best practices standards are rapidly evolving in the
         corporate governance areas as a result of recent corporate failures,
         the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and revised listing standards on major
         stock exchanges. MFS generally support these changes. However, many
         issuers are not publicly registered, are not subject to these enhanced
         listing standards or are not operating in an environment that is
         comparable to that in the United States. In reviewing proxy proposals
         under these circumstances, MFS votes for proposals that enhance
         standards of corporate governance so long as we believe that -- within
         the circumstances of the environment within which the issuers operate
         - the proposal is consistent with the best long-term economic
         interests of our clients.

                  FOREIGN ISSUERS - SHARE BLOCKING

                  In accordance with local law or business practices, many
         foreign companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for
         a certain period beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending
         on the day following the meeting ("share blocking"). Depending on the
         country in which a company is domiciled, the blocking period may begin
         a stated number of days prior to the meeting (e.g., one, three or five
         days) or on a date established by the company. While practices vary,
         in many countries the block period can be continued for a longer
         period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and postponed to a
         later date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to the ability of a
         shareholder to have the "block" restriction lifted early (e.g., in
         some countries shares generally can be "unblocked" up to two days
         prior to the meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the
         block appears to be discretionary with the issuer's transfer agent).
         Due to these restrictions, MFS must balance the benefits to its
         clients of voting proxies against the potentially serious portfolio
         management consequences of a reduced flexibility to sell the
         underlying shares at the most advantageous time. For companies in
         countries with potentially long block periods, the disadvantage of
         being unable to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions
         generally outweighs the advantages of voting at the shareholder
         meeting for routine items. Accordingly, MFS generally will not vote
         those proxies in the absence of an unusual, significant vote.
         Conversely, for companies domiciled in countries with very short block
         periods, MFS generally will continue to cast votes in accordance with
         these policies and procedures.

                  SOCIAL ISSUES

                  There are many groups advocating social change, and many have
         chosen the publicly-held corporation as a vehicle for their agenda.
         Common among these are resolutions requiring the corporation to
         refrain from investing or conducting business in certain countries, to
         adhere to some list of goals or principles (e.g., environmental
         standards) or to report on various activities. MFS votes against such
         proposals unless their shareholder-oriented benefits will outweigh any
         costs or disruptions to the business, including those that use
         corporate resources to further a particular social objective outside
         the business of the company or when no discernible shareholder
         economic advantage is evident.

                  The laws of various states may regulate how the interests of
         certain clients subject to those laws are voted. For example, the
         General Laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts prohibit the
         investment of state funds, including retirement system assets, in the
         following types of investments: (i) financial institutions which
         directly or through any subsidiary have outstanding loans to any
         individual or corporation engaged in manufacturing, distribution or
         sale of firearms, munitions, rubber or plastic bullets, tear gas,
         armored vehicles or military aircraft for use or deployment in any
         activity in Northern Ireland; or (ii) any stocks, securities or
         obligations of any company so engaged.

                  Because of these statutory restrictions, it is necessary when
         voting proxies for securities held in Massachusetts public pension
         accounts to support the purpose of this legislation. Thus, on issues
         relating to these or similar state law questions, it may be necessary
         to cast ballots differently for these portfolios than MFS might
         normally do for other accounts.

     B.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

         1.       MFS PROXY REVIEW GROUP

                  The administration of these policies and procedures is
         overseen by the MFS Proxy Review Group, which includes senior MFS
         Legal Department officers and MFS' Proxy Consultant. The MFS Proxy
         Review Group:

                  a. Reviews these policies and procedures at least annually
                     and recommends any amendments considered to be necessary
                     or advisable;

                  b. Determines whether any material conflicts of interest
                     exist with respect to instances in which (i) MFS seeks to
                     override these guidelines and (ii) votes not clearly
                     governed by these guidelines; and

                  c. Considers special proxy issues as they may arise from time
                     to time.

                  The current MFS Proxy Consultant is an independent proxy
         consultant who performs these services exclusively for MFS.

         2.       POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

                  The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for monitoring
         potential material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its
         affiliates that could arise in connection with the voting of proxies
         on behalf of MFS' clients. Any attempt to influence MFS' voting on a
         particular proxy matter should be reported to the MFS Proxy Review
         Group. The MFS Proxy Consultant will assist the MFS Proxy Review Group
         in carrying out these responsibilities.

                  In cases where proxies are voted in accordance with these
         policies and guidelines, no conflict of interest will be deemed to
         exist. In cases where (i) MFS is considering overriding these policies
         and guidelines, or (ii) matters presented for vote are not clearly
         governed by these policies and guidelines, the MFS Proxy Review Group
         and the MFS Proxy Consultant will follow these procedures:

                  a. Compare the name of the issuer of such proxy against a
                     list of significant current and potential (i) distributors
                     of MFS Fund shares, (ii) retirement plans administered by
                     MFS, and (iii) MFS institutional clients (the "MFS
                     Significant Client List");

                  b. If the name of the issuer does not appear on the MFS
                     Significant Client List, then no material conflict of
                     interest will be deemed to exist, and the proxy will be
                     voted as otherwise determined by the MFS Proxy Review
                     Group;

                  c. If the name of the issuer appears on the MFS Significant
                     Client List, then the MFS Proxy Review Group will
                     carefully evaluate the proposed votes in order to ensure
                     that the proxy ultimately is voted in what MFS believes to
                     be the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients,
                     and not in MFS' corporate interests; and

                  d. For all potential material conflicts of interest
                     identified under clause (c) above, the MFS Proxy Review
                     Group will document: the name of the issuer, the issuer's
                     relationship to MFS, the analysis of the matters submitted
                     for proxy vote, and the basis for the determination that
                     the votes ultimately were cast in what MFS believes to be
                     the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and
                     not in MFS' corporate interests.

                  The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for creating and
         maintaining the MFS Significant Client List, in consultation with MFS'
         distribution, retirement plan administration and institutional
         business units. The MFS Significant Client List will be reviewed and
         updated as necessary, but no less frequently than quarterly.

         3.       GATHERING PROXIES

                  Nearly all proxies received by MFS originate at Automatic
         Data Processing Corp. ("ADP"). ADP and issuers send proxies and
         related material directly to the record holders of the shares
         beneficially owned by MFS' clients, usually to the client's custodian
         or, less commonly, to the client itself. Each client's custodian is
         responsible for forwarding all proxy solicitation materials to MFS
         (except in the case of certain institutional clients for which MFS
         does not vote proxies). This material will include proxy cards,
         reflecting the proper shareholdings of Funds and of clients on the
         record dates for such shareholder meetings, and proxy statements, the
         issuer's explanation of the items to be voted upon.

                  MFS, on behalf of itself and the Funds, has entered into an
         agreement with an independent proxy administration firm, Institutional
         Shareholder Services, Inc. (the "Proxy Administrator"), pursuant to
         which the Proxy Administrator performs various proxy vote processing
         and recordkeeping functions for MFS' Fund and institutional client
         accounts. The Proxy Administrator does not make recommendations to MFS
         as to how to vote any particular item. The Proxy Administrator
         receives proxy statements and proxy cards directly from various
         custodians, logs these materials into its database and matches
         upcoming meetings with MFS Fund and client portfolio holdings, which
         are input into the Proxy Administrator's system by an MFS holdings
         datafeed. Through the use of the Proxy Administrator system, ballots
         and proxy material summaries for the upcoming shareholders' meetings
         of over 10,000 corporations are available on-line to certain MFS
         employees, the MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group and
         most proxies can be voted electronically. In addition to receiving the
         hard copies of materials relating to meetings of shareholders of
         issuers whose securities are held by the Funds and/or clients, the
         ballots and proxy statements can be printed from the Proxy
         Administrator's system and forwarded for review.

         4.       ANALYZING PROXIES

                  After input into the Proxy Administrator system, proxies
         which are deemed to be completely routine (e.g., those involving only
         uncontested elections of directors, appointments of auditors, and/or
         employee stock purchase plans)(1) are automatically voted in favor by
         the Proxy Administrator without being sent to either the MFS Proxy
         Consultant or the MFS Proxy Review Group for further review. Proxies
         that pertain only to merger and acquisition proposals are forwarded
         initially to an appropriate MFS portfolio manager or research analyst
         for his or her recommendation. All proxies that are reviewed by either
         the MFS Proxy Consultant or a portfolio manager or analyst are then
         forwarded with the corresponding recommendation to the MFS Proxy
         Review Group.(2)

- --------
(1) Proxies for foreign companies often contain significantly more voting items
    than those of U.S. companies. Many of these items on foreign proxies
    involve repetitive, non-controversial matters that are mandated by local
    law. Accordingly, there is an expanded list of items that are deemed
    routine (and therefore automatically voted in favor) for foreign issuers,
    including the following: (i) receiving financial statements or other
    reports from the board; (ii) approval of declarations of dividends; (iii)
    appointment of shareholders to sign board meeting minutes; (iv) the
    discharge of management and supervisory boards; and (v) approval of share
    repurchase programs.

(2) From time to time, due to travel schedules and other commitments, an
    appropriate portfolio manager or research analyst is not available to
    provide a recommendation on a merger or acquisition proposal. If such a
    recommendation cannot be obtained within a few business days prior to the
    shareholder meeting, the MFS Proxy Review Group will determine the vote in
    what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of its
    clients.

                  Recommendations with respect to voting on non-routine issues
         are generally made by the MFS Proxy Consultant in accordance with the
         policies summarized under "Voting Guidelines," and all other relevant
         materials. His or her recommendation as to how each proxy proposal
         should be voted is indicated on copies of proxy cards, including his
         or her rationale on significant items. These cards are then forwarded
         to the MFS Proxy Review Group.

                  As a general matter, portfolio managers and investment
         analysts are consulted and involved in developing MFS' substantive
         proxy voting guidelines, but have little or no involvement in or
         knowledge of proxy proposals or voting positions taken by MFS. This is
         designed to promote consistency in the application of MFS' voting
         guidelines, to promote consistency in voting on the same or similar
         issues (for the same or for multiple issuers) across all client
         accounts, and to minimize or remove the potential that proxy
         solicitors, issuers, and third parties might attempt to exert
         influence on the vote or might create a conflict of interest that is
         not in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests
         of our clients. In limited, specific instances (e.g., mergers), the
         MFS Proxy Consultant or the MFS Proxy Review Group may consult with or
         seek recommendations from portfolio managers or analysts. The MFS
         Proxy Review Group would ultimately determine the manner in which all
         proxies are voted.

                  As noted above, MFS reserves the right to override the
         guidelines when such an override is, in MFS' best judgment, consistent
         with the guiding principle of voting proxies in the best long-term
         economic interests of MFS' clients. Any such override of the
         guidelines shall be examined, explained and reported in accordance
         with the procedures set forth in these policies.

         5.       VOTING PROXIES

                  After the proxy card copies are reviewed, they are voted
         electronically through the Proxy Administrator's system. In accordance
         with its contract with MFS, the Proxy Administrator also generates a
         variety of reports for the MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy
         Review Group, and makes available on-line various other types of
         information so that the MFS Proxy Review Group and the MFS Proxy
         Consultant may monitor the votes cast by the Proxy Administrator on
         behalf of MFS' clients.

     C.  MONITORING SYSTEM

                  It is the responsibility of the Proxy Administrator and MFS'
         Proxy Consultant to monitor the proxy voting process. As noted above,
         when proxy materials for clients are received, they are forwarded to
         the Proxy Administrator and are input into the Proxy Administrator's
         system. Additionally, through an interface with the portfolio holdings
         database of MFS, the Proxy Administrator matches a list of all MFS
         Funds and clients who hold shares of a company's stock and the number
         of shares held on the record date with the Proxy Administrator's
         listing of any upcoming shareholder's meeting of that company.

                  When the Proxy Administrator's system "tickler" shows that
         the date of a shareholders' meeting is approaching, a Proxy
         Administrator representative checks that the vote for MFS Funds and
         clients holding that security has been recorded in the computer
         system. If a proxy card has not been received from the client's
         custodian, the Proxy Administrator calls the custodian requesting that
         the materials be forward immediately. If it is not possible to receive
         the proxy card from the custodian in time to be voted at the meeting,
         MFS may instruct the custodian to cast the vote in the manner
         specified and to mail the proxy directly to the issuer.

     D.  RECORDS RETENTION

                  MFS will retain copies of these policies and procedures in
         effect from time to time and will retain all proxy voting reports
         submitted to the Board of Trustees and Board of Managers of the MFS
         Funds for a period of six years. Proxy solicitation materials,
         including electronic versions of the proxy cards completed by the MFS
         Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group, together with their
         respective notes and comments, are maintained in an electronic format
         by the Proxy Administrator and are accessible on-line by the MFS Proxy
         Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group. All proxy voting materials
         and supporting documentation, including records generated by the Proxy
         Administrator's system as to proxies processed, the dates when proxies
         were received and returned, and the votes on each company's proxy
         issues, are retained for six years.

     E.  REPORTS

                  MFS FUNDS

                  Periodically, MFS will report the results of its voting to
         the Board of Trustees and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds. These
         reports will include: (i) a listing of how votes were cast; (ii) a
         review of situations where MFS did not vote in accordance with the
         guidelines and the rationale therefor; (iii) a review of the
         procedures used by MFS to identify material conflicts of interest; and
         (iv) a review of these policies and the guidelines and, as necessary
         or appropriate, any proposed modifications thereto to reflect new
         developments in corporate governance and other issues. Based on these
         reviews, the Trustees and Managers of the MFS Funds will consider
         possible modifications to these policies to the extent necessary or
         advisable.

                  ALL MFS ADVISORY CLIENTS

                  At any time, a report can be printed by MFS for each client
         who has requested that MFS furnish a record of votes cast. The report
         specifies the proxy issues which have been voted for the client during
         the year and the position taken with respect to each issue.

Generally, MFS will not divulge actual voting practices to any party other than
the client or its representatives (unless required by applicable law) because
we consider that information to be confidential and proprietary to the client.

                                                                SEPTEMBER, 2003


                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                          PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (this "Code") has been adopted by the funds
(collectively, "Funds" and each, "Fund") under supervision of the MFS Funds
Board and Compass Board of Trustees/Managers (the "Boards") and applies to the
Funds' Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the
"Covered Officers" each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

         o honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
           or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
           relationships;

         o full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
           reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submits to, the
           Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
           communications made by the Funds;

         o compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules
           and regulations;

         o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
           appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o accountability for adherence to the Code.

II. CONDUCT GUIDELINES

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer
should not place his or her personal interests ahead of the Funds' interests
and should endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Covered Officer must:

         o not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
           improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
           for any Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to
           the detriment of the Fund; and

         o not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
           individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
           benefit the Fund.

         The following activities, which could create the appearance of a
conflict of interest, are permitted only with the approval of the Funds' Chief
Legal Officer ("CLO"):

         o service as a director on the board of any "for profit" company;

         o running for political office;

         o the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;

         o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
           has current or prospective business dealings unless such
           entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
           as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
           of impropriety;

         o any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
           relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian
           banks, audit firms), other than the Funds' investment adviser,
           principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
           thereof;

         o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
           charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
           transactions or for selling or redeeming shares, other than an
           interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment or securities
           ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
           disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;

         o each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
           others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within
           or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors,
           and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
           her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and
           employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting
           full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
           reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
           in other public communications made by the Funds; and

         o it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
           compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the
           standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
           regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
           becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he
           or she has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied
           with the requirements of the Code;

         o annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are
           or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the
           Covered Officer's duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual
           Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;

         o not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or
           employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
           potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this
           Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
questions are presented under it, granting waivers upon consultation with the
appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will
report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board (or a designee thereof)
promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the
appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.

         The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
         violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the
         appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has occurred,
         it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
         appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
         board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer.

         Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or
policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their investment adviser or
other service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this
Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority
of independent trustees.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be
maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or
this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Funds' Board, its counsel, counsel to the Board's independent
trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Fund's
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

     b.  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
         employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting.
