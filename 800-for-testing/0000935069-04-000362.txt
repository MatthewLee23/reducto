                         Report of Independent Auditors

To the Members and Board of Directors of
  UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund") as of December  31, 2003,  and the
related statements of operations, cash flows and changes in members' capital for
the period from February 1, 2003  (commencement  of  operations) to December 31,
2003.  These  financial   statements  are  the   responsibility  of  the  Fund's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards  generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial  statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our
procedures  included  confirmation of investments owned as of December 31, 2003,
by  correspondence  with  management  of the  investment  funds.  An audit  also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by  management,   as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall   financial   statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audit  provides a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial position of UBS M2, L.L.C. at December 31,
2003,  the  results of its  operations,  its cash  flows and the  changes in its
members'  capital for the period from  February 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003, in
conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States.



                                                            /s/ERNST & YOUNG LLP

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2003

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   ORGANIZATION

     UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.  (the "Fund")  (formerly,  UBS PW M2 Fund,  L.L.C.) was
     organized  as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of  Delaware on
     September 4, 2002. The Fund is registered under the Investment  Company Act
     of 1940,  as amended (the "1940 Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,
     management  investment company.  The Fund's investment objective is to seek
     capital  appreciation over the long term. The Fund is a multi-manager  fund
     that seeks to achieve its  objective by deploying its assets among a select
     group  of  portfolio   managers  who  primarily  employ  long/short  equity
     strategies,  including those involving  foreign  issuers.  Generally,  such
     portfolio managers conduct their investment  programs through  unregistered
     investment funds (collectively,  the "Investment Funds"), in which the Fund
     invests  as a limited  partner,  member or  shareholder  along  with  other
     investors. The Fund commenced operations on February 1, 2003.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall  responsibility
     to manage and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
     exclusive  authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
     management,  conduct and  operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
     have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA",  the "Adviser"  and, when
     providing services under the Administration Agreement, the "Administrator")
     (formerly, PW Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.), a Delaware limited liability company,
     to provide  investment  advice  regarding the selection of Investment Funds
     and the responsibility of the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Adviser is an indirect wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
     which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG,  and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Adviser may  determine  and are  generally
     accepted monthly. The Fund reserves the right to reject any application for
     interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to
     written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors,  in their complete
     and exclusive discretion. The Adviser expects that it will recommend to the
     Directors that the Fund offer to repurchase interests from Members in March
     2004 and December 2004 and, thereafter,  twice each year, near mid-year and
     year-end.  Members can only transfer or assign their  membership  interests
     (i) by operation of law pursuant to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency  or
     dissolution  of a  Member,  or  (ii)  with  the  written  approval  of  the
     Directors, which may be withheld in their sole and absolute discretion.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
     Adviser  as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
     accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set  forth  below or as may be
     determined  from  time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
     Directors.  The  Fund's  investments

                                                                               6

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2003

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     in  Investment  Funds  are  subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of the
     respective operating agreements and offering memoranda, as appropriate. The
     Fund's  investments  in  Investment  Funds  are  carried  at fair  value as
     determined  by the  Fund's  pro-rata  interest  in the net  assets  of each
     Investment Fund. All valuations utilize financial  information  supplied by
     each Investment  Fund and are net of management and  performance  incentive
     fees or allocations  payable to the Investment  Funds' managers or pursuant
     to the Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The underlying  investments of each
     Investment  Fund  are  accounted  for at fair  value as  described  in each
     Investment Fund's financial statements.

     Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in the
     form of  cash or  securities,  are  first  applied  as a  reduction  of the
     investment's cost.

     B.   INCOME RECOGNITION

     Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses
     from  Investment  Fund  transactions  are calculated on the identified cost
     basis.

     C.   FUND COSTS

     The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not
     limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
     and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value;  costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  organization
     costs; due diligence,  including travel and related  expenses;  expenses of
     meetings of Directors and Members; all costs with respect to communications
     to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors. Offering
     costs are charged to capital as incurred.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
     been provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member is
     individually  required  to report on its own tax  return  its  distributive
     share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     The Fund has  reclassified  $3,243,766  and $28,493  from  accumulated  net
     investment  loss  and  accumulated  net  realized  loss  from  investments,
     respectively, to net capital contributions during the period ended December
     31, 2003.  The  reclassification  was to reflect,  as an  adjustment to net
     capital contributions,  the amount of taxable income or loss that have been
     allocated to the Fund's Members and had no effect on net assets.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
     account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
     accrued interest, which is included in interest receivable

                                                                               7

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (CONTINUED)

     on the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

     F.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

     From  time to time  the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
     connection  with  such  transactions  it is  the  Fund's  policy  that  its
     custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities, the fair
     value of which exceeds the principal amount of the repurchase  transaction,
     including accrued interest,  at all times. If the seller defaults,  and the
     fair value of the collateral declines, realization of the collateral by the
     Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of December 31, 2003 there were no open
     repurchase agreements.

     G.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
     principles  generally accepted in the United States requires the Adviser to
     make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the
     financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that the
     estimates  utilized  in  preparing  the  Fund's  financial  statements  are
     reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual  results could differ from these
     estimates.

3.   INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATOR FEE AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Adviser provides  investment  advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
     an Investment Manager Agreement.  Pursuant to that agreement, the Fund pays
     the Adviser a monthly fee (the  "Investment  Management Fee") at the annual
     rate of 1.45% of the Fund's net assets,  excluding  assets  attributable to
     the Adviser  and the  Administrator.  The  Administrator  provides  certain
     administrative  services  to  the  Fund,  including,  among  other  things,
     providing office space and other support  services.  In  consideration  for
     such  services,  the  Fund  pays  the  Administrator  a  monthly  fee  (the
     "Administrator  Fee") at an annual  rate of 0.30% of the Fund's net assets,
     excluding  assets  attributable  to the  Administrator's  and the Adviser's
     capital account.  The Administrator  Fee and the Investment  Management Fee
     will be paid to the  Administrator  out of the Fund's  assets  and  debited
     against the Members' capital accounts, excluding net assets attributable to
     the  Administrator's  and the Adviser's  capital account.  A portion of the
     Investment Management Fee and the Administrator Fee is paid by UBSFA to its
     affiliates.

     UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI") (formerly, UBS PaineWebber,  Inc.),
     a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc., acts as a placement agent
     for the Fund, without special compensation from the Fund, and will bear its
     own costs  associated  with its  activities as placement  agent.  Placement
     fees, if any, charged on contributions are debited against the contribution
     amounts, to arrive at a net subscription amount. The placement fee does not
     constitute assets of the Fund.

     The net increase (or decrease) in Members'  capital derived from operations
     (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of all Members on
     a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than  the  Investment  Management  Fee  and the
     Administrator Fee which are similarly  allocated to all Members' other than
     the

                                                                               8

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2003

3.   INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FEE, ADMINISTRATOR FEE AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
     (CONTINUED)

     Adviser or Administrator as described above.

     The Adviser has voluntarily undertaken to bear certain initial organization
     and offering costs  otherwise  borne by the Fund and its Members during the
     Fund's  first  twelve  months  of  operations.  The  Adviser's  undertaking
     provides that Members will not bear initial organization and offering costs
     in  excess of 0.25% of total  Members'  capital  as a result of the  Fund's
     start-up.

     Organization  costs are expensed and offering costs are charged to Members'
     capital as incurred based on the undertaking provided above.

     In order to achieve a more  equitable  distribution  of the impact of these
     costs,  the Fund has either  credited to or debited  against  the  Members'
     capital  accounts  the sum of such initial  costs based on each  individual
     Member's percentage of capital in the Fund. The reallocation of these costs
     will occur for the first twelve  months  after the initial  closing date of
     the Fund.

     Each Director who is not an "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by
     the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer  of $5,000 plus a fee for each
     meeting  attended.  Any  Director  who is an  "interested  person" does not
     receive any annual or other fee from the Fund. All Directors are reimbursed
     by the  Fund for all  reasonable  out of  pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts
     expensed related to Directors by the Fund for the period ended December 31,
     2003 were $17,384.

     PFPC Trust Company (an  affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as the custodian
     (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial services for
     the Fund.

     PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate  of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as  Accounting  and
     Investor  Servicing Agent to the Fund and in that capacity provides certain
     administrative,   accounting,   record  keeping,  tax  and  Member  related
     services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee  primarily  based upon (i) the
     average net assets of the Fund  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and (ii)
     the  aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
     sponsored or advised by UBS Americas, Inc. or its affiliates. Additionally,
     the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

4.   SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     Aggregate  purchases  and sales of  Investment  Funds for the period  ended
     December 31, 2003, amounted to $250,000,000 and $6,971,507, respectively.

     The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the  Investment  Funds.
     The  allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by the  Investment
     Funds on Schedules  K-1.  The Fund has not yet received all such  Schedules
     K-1 for the period ended December 31, 2003.



                                                                               9

          that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
          2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
          accountant's independence.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


I.   GENERAL GUIDELINES AND POLICY

UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "Adviser")  votes  proxies  for each fund (the
"Fund")  for  which it acts as the  Adviser.  Certain  of the Funds are funds of
funds that invest  primarily in unregistered  investment  vehicles  ("Investment
Funds") which have investors other than the Fund. Each of these Funds may invest
a majority  of its assets in  non-voting  securities  of  Investment  Funds.  In
addition,  Investment  Funds  typically do not submit  matters to investors  for
vote.  If an  Investment  Fund submits a matter to a Fund for vote (and the Fund
holds voting  interests in the  Investment  Fund),  The Adviser will vote on the
matter  in a way that it  believes  is in the best  interest  of the Fund and in
accordance with these policies and procedures.

     In voting proxies, the Adviser is guided by general fiduciary principles.
The Adviser's goal is to act prudently, solely in the best interest of each
client. The Adviser attempts to consider all factors of its vote that could
affect the value of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner that it
believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize shareholder values.

     It is the Adviser's general policy, absent a particular reason to the
contrary, to vote with management's recommendations on routine matters. Other
matters will be voted on a case-by-case basis.

II.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     In furtherance of the Adviser's goal to vote proxies in the best interests
of clients, the Adviser follows procedures designed to identify and address
material conflicts that may arise between the Adviser's interests and those of
its clients before voting proxies on behalf of such clients.

(1)  Procedures for Identifying Conflicts of Interest.

     The Adviser relies on the following to seek to identify conflicts of
     interest with respect to proxy voting:

<PAGE>

     The Adviser's employees are under an obligation (i) to be aware of the
     potential for conflicts of interest on the part of the Adviser with respect
     to voting proxies on behalf of client accounts both as a result of an
     employee's personal relationships and due to special circumstances that may
     arise during the conduct of the Adviser's business, and (ii) to bring
     conflicts of interest of which they become aware to the attention of Ruth
     Goodstein and Mark Goldstein.

(2)  Procedures for Assessing Materiality of Conflicts of Interest and for
     Addressing Material Conflicts of Interest

     A.   All conflicts of interest identified must be brought to the attention
          of Ms. Goodstein and Mr. Goldstein for resolution.

     B.   Ms. Goodstein and Mr. Goldstein will work with appropriate personnel
          of the Adviser to determine whether a conflict of interest is
          material. A conflict of interest will be considered material to the
          extent that it is determined that such conflict has the potential to
          influence the Adviser's decision-making in voting the proxy. All
          materiality determinations will be based on an assessment of the
          particular facts and circumstances. The Adviser shall maintain a
          written record of all materiality determinations.

     C.   If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the
          Adviser may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the
          conflict.

     D.   If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the
          Adviser's Legal Department will work with appropriate personnel of the
          Adviser to agree upon a method to resolve such conflict of interest
          before voting proxies affected by the conflict of interest. Such
          methods may include:

          o    disclosing the conflict to clients and obtaining their consent
               before voting (which consent in the case of a Fund with a board
               of directors may be obtained from the Fund's board of directors);
          o    engaging another party on behalf of the client to vote the proxy
               on its behalf;
          o    engage a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the
               proxy based on application of the policies set forth herein; or
          o    such other method as is deemed appropriate under the
               circumstances given the nature of the conflict.

          The Adviser shall maintain a written record of the method used to
          resolve a material conflict of interest.


III. RECORD KEEPING AND OVERSIGHT

          The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy
          voting:

          o    a copy of these policies and procedures;

<PAGE>

          o    a copy of each proxy form (as voted);

          o    a copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements)
               and related materials with regard to each vote;

          o    documentation relating to the identification and resolution of
               conflicts of interest;

          o    any documents created by the Adviser that were material to a
               proxy voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that
               decision; and

          o    a copy of each written client request for information on how the
               Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the client, and a copy of any
               written response by the Adviser to any (written or oral) client
               request for information on how the Adviser voted proxies on
               behalf of the requesting client.

     Such records shall be maintained and preserved in an easily accessible
place for a period of not less than five years from the end of the fiscal year
during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in the
Adviser's office.

     In addition, with respect to proxy voting records for any fund registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Adviser shall maintain such
records as are necessary to allow such fund to comply with its recordkeeping,
reporting and disclosure obligations under applicable laws, rules and
regulations.

     In lieu of keeping copies of proxy statements, the Adviser may rely on
proxy statements filed on the EDGAR system as well as on third party records of
proxy statements and votes cast if the third party provides an undertaking to
provide the documents promptly upon request.

            UBS FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT GROUP

                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
                          AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (the "Code") for the UBS Financial Services Inc.
Alternative Investment Group investment companies (each, a "Fund") applies to
each Fund's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer and
other persons performing similar functions, each of whom is listed on Exhibit A
(the "Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

     o    honest and ethical  conduct,  including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent  conflicts of interest  between  personal and professional
          relationships;

     o    full, fair, accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     o    compliance   with   applicable   laws  and   governmental   rules  and
          regulations;

     o    the  prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of  the  Code  to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT  CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST


         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the Fund.
For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his
position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
Company Act"), and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the
"Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund. Policies and procedures applicable to the Fund and the Fund's
investment adviser (collectively, the "Adviser") are designed to prevent, or
identify and correct, violations of these provisions. The



<PAGE>

Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and
procedures, and the circumstances they cover fall outside of the parameters of
the Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the Fund and the Adviser of which the Covered Officers are also officers
or employees. As a result, the Code recognizes that the Covered Officers, in the
ordinary course of their duties (whether formally for the Fund or for the
Adviser, or for both), will be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the Adviser and the
Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the Adviser and is
consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the
Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, will be deemed to have
been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board that
the Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes of ethics.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. Covered Officers should keep in mind that
the Code cannot cover every possible scenario. The overarching principle of the
Code is that the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed
improperly before the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must:

          o    not use his personal influence or personal relationships
               improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
               reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
               personally to the detriment of the Fund;

          o    not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for
               the individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather
               than the benefit of the Fund;

          o    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
               made or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause
               others to trade personally in contemplation of the market effect
               of such transactions; and

          o    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports
               of potential violations that are made in good faith.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

          o    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the
               disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

          o    each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
               others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
               within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Board members
               and auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
               organizations; and

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

          o    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his
               area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees
               of the Fund and the Adviser and take other appropriate steps with
               the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
               understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund
               files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
               communications made by the Fund; and

          o    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
               compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
               applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

          o    upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter, as applicable, upon
               becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that
               he has received, read, and understands the Code;

          o    annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with
               the requirements of the Code; and

          o    notify Herb Janick or such other representative(s) of the UBS
               Financial Services Inc. Legal Department as may be designated
               from time to time ("Counsel") promptly if he knows of any
               violation of the Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of
               the Code.

         Counsel is responsible for applying the Code to specific situations in
which questions are presented under it and has the authority to interpret the
Code in any particular situation. However, approvals, interpretations or waivers
sought by any Covered Officer will be considered by a committee designated by
the Fund's Board (the "Committee"). In the absence of a designation, the
Committee shall be the Board.

         The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
the Code:

          o    Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
               potential violations reported to him;

          o    if, after such investigation, Counsel believes that no violation
               has occurred, Counsel is not required to take any further action;

          o    any matter that Counsel believes is a violation will be reported
               to the Committee;

          o    if the Committee determines that a violation has occurred, it
               will inform and make a recommendation to the Board, which will
               consider appropriate action, which may include: review of, and
               appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
               notification to appropriate personnel of the Adviser or its
               board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

          o    the Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as
               appropriate; and

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

          o    any waivers of or amendments to the Code, to the extent required,
               will be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies and procedures of the Fund, the Adviser, principal underwriter, or
other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities
of the Covered Officers who are subject to the Code, they are superceded by the
Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of the
Code. The Fund's, the Adviser's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
Investment Company Act and the Adviser's additional policies and procedures are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of the Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Except as to Exhibit A, the Code may not be amended except in written
form, which is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the
Fund's Board, including a majority of independent Board members.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall
not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Funds and their counsel,
the appropriate Boards (or Committees) and their counsel and the Adviser.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of the Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
