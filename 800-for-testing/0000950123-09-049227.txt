1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC, and the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC
(collectively the "Funds" and individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of
Delaware as limited liability companies. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment companies. Each of the Funds is a
fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital appreciation by allocating their assets
among a select group of private investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds)
("Portfolio Funds") that utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies
specific for each Fund to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the
Investment Manager to the Funds.

The Funds operate under a master fund/feeder fund structure. Feeder Funds invest
substantially all of their investable assets in the Funds. As of July 31, 2009
the Feeder Funds' beneficial ownership of their corresponding Master Funds'
members' capital are 78%, 82%, 81%, and 89% for the Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy
Arbitrage Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Cayman
Fund, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Cayman Fund, and Aetos Capital
Opportunities Cayman Fund, respectively.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Opportunities Fund") seeks capital
appreciation by investing its assets among a select group of alternative asset
managers employing different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of
attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital.

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds and any restrictions on or illiquidity of the
interests in the Portfolio Funds, in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current market exchange and the differences
could be material to the financial statements. The use of different factors or
estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair
value.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions (continued)

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements"
("FAS 157") establishes a fair value hierarchy and specifies that a valuation
technique used to measure fair value shall maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The objective of a fair value
measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Accordingly, the fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy under FAS 157 are as follows:

     -    Level 1 -- Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active
          markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the
          Funds have the ability to access at the measurement date;

     -    Level 2 -- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
          asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including inputs in
          markets that are not considered to be active;

     -    Level 3 -- Inputs that are unobservable.

Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make
valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. The Investment Manager
generally uses the capital balance reported by a Portfolio Fund as the primary
input to its valuation; however adjustments to the reported capital balance may
be made based on various factors, including, but not limited to, the attributes
of the interest in the Portfolio Fund held, including the rights and
obligations, and any restrictions on or illiquidity of such interests, and the
fair value of such Portfolio Fund's investment portfolio or other assets and
liabilities.

An individual Portfolio Fund's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on
the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Portfolio Funds classified within Level 3 consider several inputs and may
include Level 1 or Level 2 inputs as components of the overall fair value
measurement.

All of the Funds' investments in Portfolio Funds have been classified within
Level 3, and the Funds generally do not hold any investments that could be
classified as Level 1 or Level 2, as observable prices for investments in
Portfolio Funds are typically not available.

</TABLE>

Realized gains and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the
identified cost basis. Investments are recorded on the effective date of the
subscription in the Portfolio Fund.

C. Fund Income and Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and consists of interest earned
on cash and cash equivalents.

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to continue to be treated as a partnership for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit
relating to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. The Funds withhold and pay taxes on U.S.
source income and U.S. effectively connected income, if any, allocated from
Portfolio Funds to the extent such income is not exempted from withholding under
the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations thereunder. The actual amount of such
taxes is not known until all Form K-1s from Portfolio Funds are received,
usually in the following tax year. Prior to the final determination the amount
of tax is estimated based on information available. The final tax could be
different from the estimated tax and the difference could be significant.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. Income Taxes (continued)

Such withholdings are listed as distributions in the Statements of Changes in
Members' Capital, and are allocated to the individual Members' Capital accounts
to which they apply.

E. Distribution Policy

The Funds have no present intention of making periodic distributions of their
net investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and
frequency of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of
the Board.

F. Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G. Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents is defined as cash on deposit at financial
institutions, investments in money market funds, and highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Each Fund invests its cash in
the SEI Daily Income Trust Government Fund, a money market fund managed by an
affiliate of the Administrator. These holdings are included in the cash and cash
equivalents balance on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The cost of the
money market funds held at July 31, 2009 equals fair value.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.

The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the Opportunities Fund) of
each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May 31, 2008. Effective
June 1, 2008, the expense limitation for the Funds has been terminated.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Investment Manager may also be paid an annual performance-based incentive
fee outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of 0.12% on the first $250 million of net
assets, 0.10% on net assets between $250 million and $500 million and 0.08% on
net assets over $500 million, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.
Each Fund also pays the Custodian $3,000 annually to act as qualified Custodian
for its Cayman feeder fund.

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act received an annual retainer of $32,000 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $3,250 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee received an additional annual
retainer of $1,900. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interests in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

5. FUND MERGER

On November 1, 2008, Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC was
reorganized into Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC. The value of
the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Fund, LLC on November 1, 2008 was $46,535,603,
which was comprised of $40,692,369 of an investment in a Portfolio Fund,
$5,952,897 of cash, $682,234 of receivable for sale of investments, $9,688 of
interest receivable, $546,873 of redemptions of interests payable, and $254,712
of expenses payable.

6. RISK FACTORS

Limitations on the Funds' ability to withdraw their assets from Portfolio Funds
may limit the Funds' ability to repurchase their Interests. For example, many
Portfolio Funds impose lock-up periods prior to allowing withdrawals, which can
be two years or longer. After expiration of the lock-up period, withdrawals
typically are permitted only on a limited basis, such as monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually or annually. In instances where the primary source of funds to
repurchase Interests will be withdrawals from Portfolio Funds, the application
of these lock-ups and withdrawal limitations may significantly limit the Funds'
ability to repurchase their Interests.

The Fund invests primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques that may
involve significant risks. Such risks include those related to the volatility of
the equity, credit, and currency markets, the use of leverage associated with
certain fixed income strategies, derivative contracts and in connection with
short positions, the potential illiquidity of certain instruments and
counterparty and broker arrangements.

The Portfolio Funds may invest a higher percentage of their assets in specific
sectors of the market in order to achieve a potentially greater investment
return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be more susceptible to economic,
political and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the market,
positive or negative, and may experience increased volatility of the Portfolio
Fund's net asset value.

The Portfolio Funds may invest in securities of foreign companies that involve
special risks and considerations not typically associated with investments in
the United States of America, due to concentrated investments in a limited
number of countries or regions, which may vary throughout the year depending on
the Portfolio Fund. Such concentrations may subject the Portfolio Funds to
additional risks resulting from political or economic conditions in such
countries or regions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
currency exchange restrictions could cause the securities and their markets to
be less liquid and their prices to be more volatile than those of comparable
U.S. securities.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

6. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)

The Funds invest in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk. Various risks are also associated with an investment
in the Funds, including risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the
Fund, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks related to limited
liquidity of the Interests.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

For the six-month period ended July 31, 2009, purchases and sales of investments
were as follows:

the net assets and incentive fees or allocations of 10% to 20% of net profits
earned. The Portfolio Funds provide for periodic redemptions, with lock-up
provisions ranging from 3 months to 3 years from initial investment. The
liquidity provisions shown in the table apply after any applicable lock-up
provisions.

                   Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements

                                  July 31, 2009
                                   (Unaudited)

At a meeting held in person on July 24, 2009, the Board of Managers of each
Fund, including the independent board members (the "Boards"), discussed the
materials previously provided to them and reviewed the nature, quality and scope
of the services provided to the Funds by the Investment Manager. The Boards also
considered the proposed fees to be charged under the Investment Advisory
Agreements, as well as each Fund's performance, and reviewed the comparative fee
and performance data previously provided by the Investment Manager. They also
considered the information provided by the Investment Manager regarding the
Investment Manager's financial performance and profitability. In considering the
approval of the Advisory Agreement for each Fund, the Board members gave
particular consideration to the following factors:

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

The Board of each Fund reviewed and considered the nature and extent of the
investment advisory services provided by the Investment Manager to the Funds
under the Investment Advisory Agreements, including the selection of underlying
hedge funds ("Portfolio Funds"), allocation of each Fund's assets among, and
monitoring performance of, Portfolio Funds, evaluation of risk exposure of
Portfolio Funds and reputation, experience and training of Portfolio Funds'
investment managers ("Portfolio Managers"), management of short-term cash and
operations of each Portfolio Fund, and day-to-day portfolio management and
general due diligence examination of Portfolio Funds before and after committing
assets of each Fund for investment. The Boards also reviewed and considered the
nature and extent of the non-advisory, administrative services provided by the
Investment Manager under the Investment Advisory Agreements, including, among
other things, providing to each Fund office facilities, equipment and personnel.
The Boards also reviewed and considered the qualifications of the portfolio
managers, the senior administrative managers and other key personnel of the
Investment Manager who provide the investment advisory and administrative
services to each Fund. The Boards determined that the Investment Manager's
portfolio managers and key personnel are well qualified by education and/or
training and experience to perform the services in an efficient and professional
manner. The Boards concluded that the overall quality of the advisory and
administrative services was satisfactory.

PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPARABLE FUNDS MANAGED BY OTHER ADVISERS

The Boards reviewed the performance of each Fund based on information provided
by the Investment Manager that showed each Fund's return for its most recent
fiscal year as compared to the return of other comparable registered
funds-of-hedge-funds for their most recent fiscal years. The Boards considered
each Fund's performance since inception, the relative lack of correlation of
such performance to fixed income or equity indices generally, and the
performance of each Fund over the prior year during a period of extreme market
stress. The Boards concluded that each Fund's performance was satisfactory.

             Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements (continued)

FEES AND EXPENSES RELATIVE TO COMPARABLE FUNDS MANAGED BY OTHER ADVISERS

The Boards reviewed the management fee rate (the "Management Fee") and total
expense ratio of each Fund. The Boards also reviewed the annual separate program
(the "Program") fee of up to 0.50% and the performance fee of up to 10% of
aggregate Program net profits above the return of the 90 day Treasury Bill (the
"Incentive Fee") payable to the Investment Manager by investors in the Funds.
The Boards also reviewed a report prepared by the Investment Manager comparing
the fees payable by each Fund to those payable by other comparable registered
funds-of-hedge-funds. The Boards noted that the fees payable to the Investment
Manager, including the Program fee and the Incentive Fee, were lower than or
comparable to the fees payable to the advisers of most comparable registered
funds-of-hedge-funds. The Board concluded that each Fund's Management Fee,
Program fee, Incentive Fee and total expense ratio were reasonable and
satisfactory in light of the services provided.

BREAKPOINTS AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE

The Boards reviewed the structure of each Fund's Management Fee schedule under
the Investment Advisory Agreements and noted that it does not include any
breakpoints. The Boards considered that each Fund's Management Fee was 0.75% and
concluded that the fee was sufficiently low that the Boards did not need to
consider adding breakpoints at this time. The Boards also determined that, given
the relative size of each Fund, economies of scale were not a factor that needed
to be considered at this time.

PROFITABILITY OF ADVISER AND AFFILIATES

The Boards considered and reviewed information concerning the costs incurred and
profits realized by the Investment Manager and its affiliates during the
previous year from the Investment Manager's relationship with each Fund. The
Boards noted that the Funds' investor base consists of sophisticated investors
that are capable of evaluating whether the fees charged and the services
provided by the Investment Manager are appropriate. The Boards noted that the
Investment Manager had first become profitable in 2005, and that its profit
margins had not substantially increased since that time. Based on their review
of the information they received, the Boards concluded that the profits earned
by the Investment Manager and its affiliates were not excessive in light of the
advisory, administrative and other services provided to each Fund.

GENERAL CONCLUSION

After considering and weighing all of the above factors, the Board of each Fund
concluded it would be in the best interest of the Funds and its Members to
approve the Investment Advisory Agreements.
