your Fund continued to provide you with attractive tax-free monthly income. For
more specific information about the performance of your Fund, please see the
Portfolio Manager's Comments and Performance Overview sections of this report.

knows what the future will bring, which is why we think a well-balanced
portfolio that is structured and carefully monitored with the help of an
investment professional is an important component in achieving your long-term
financial goals. A well-diversified portfolio may actually help to reduce your
overall investment risk, and we believe that municipal bond investments like
your Nuveen Fund can be important building blocks in a portfolio crafted to
perform well through a variety of market conditions.

I'd also like to direct your attention to the inside front cover of this report,
which explains the quick and easy process to begin receiving Fund reports like
this via e-mail and the internet. Thousands of Nuveen Fund shareholders already
have signed-up, and they are getting their Fund information faster and more

Nuveen Municipal Closed-End Exchange-Traded Funds
(NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX, NVG, NEA)

Portfolio Manager's
               COMMENTS

Portfolio manager Tom O'Shaughnessy reviews economic and market conditions, key
investment strategies, and the recent performance of the Funds. With 20 years of
investment experience at Nuveen, Tom has managed NEA since its inception in
November 2002, and assumed management responsibility for NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX and
NVG in January 2003.

WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE PERIOD
ENDED APRIL 30, 2003?

The underlying economic and market conditions have not changed much since our
last shareholder report dated October 31, 2002. We believe the most influential
factors shaping the U.S. economy and the municipal market during this reporting
period continued to be the sluggish pace of economic growth and interest rates
that remained at 40-year lows. At the same time, continued geopolitical
concerns, centering on the ongoing threat of terrorism and the situation in
Iraq, also had an impact during this reporting period, particularly in terms of
investor sentiment.

In the municipal market, the slow economic recovery and the continued lack of
inflationary pressures created conditions that helped many bonds perform well
during this reporting period. As of April 2003, inflation was running at 1.5%
annualized, the lowest annual rate in 37 years. Following a record year in 2002,
municipal issuance nationwide remained very heavy during the first four months
of 2003, with $113.5 billion in new municipal bonds coming to market, an
increase of 21% over the same period in 2002. Despite the large supply of new
municipal bonds, firm or improving prices indicated continued strong demand from
investors. In particular, institutional investors such as property/ casualty
insurance companies, hedge funds, arbitrage accounts and pension funds were
active buyers in the municipal market over much of this reporting period.

HOW DID THESE FUNDS PERFORM OVER THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2003?

Individual results for these Funds, as well as for appropriate benchmarks, are

1    The total annual returns on common share net asset value (NAV) for these
     insured Funds are compared with the total annual return of the Lehman
     Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index, an unleveraged index comprising a
     broad range of insured municipal bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not
     reflect any expenses.

2    The total returns of these Nuveen Funds are compared with the average
     annualized return of the 22 funds in the Lipper Insured Leveraged Municipal
     Debt Funds category. Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of
     dividends.

3    The taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Nuveen Fund on an
     after-tax basis. The taxable-equivalent yield is based on the Fund's market
     yield on the indicated date and a federal income tax rate of 30%.

For the twelve months ended April 30, 2003, all five of the Funds in this report
having at least one year of performance history outperformed the unleveraged,
unmanaged Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index and their Lipper Fund
peer group average.

Much of this outperformance relative to the Lehman Index is attributable to the
Funds' use of leverage, a strategy that adds volatility but can provide the
opportunity for additional income for common shareholders. Leverage can work
especially well during periods of low short-term interest rates, as was the case
during the twelve-month period.

In addition to leverage, the relative performances of these Funds were
influenced by factors such as call exposure, credit selection, and the generally
strong overall performance of AAA rated securities over the measurement period.
During the twelve-month period, the total return performance of the insured
municipal sector of the Lehman index topped that of the municipal market as a
whole by almost 100 basis points.

HOW DID THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT AFFECT THE FUNDS' DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICES?

With short-term interest rates at historically low levels, the dividend-payment
capabilities of these Funds benefited from their use of leverage. The amount of
this benefit is tied in part to the short-term rates the Funds pay their
MuniPreferred(R) shareholders. Low short-term rates can enable the Funds to
reduce the amount of income they pay MuniPreferred holders, which can
potentially leave more earnings to support common share dividends. During the
twelve months ended April 30, 2003, the continued low level of short-term
interest rates enabled us to implement four dividend increases in NQI and three
each in NIO, NIF, and NPX. The two newer Funds - NVG and NEA - have continued to
pay steady, attractive dividends since their first dividend declarations in May
2002 and January 2003, respectively.

Over the course of the twelve-month period, strong demand and favorable market
conditions helped to boost the share prices and NAVs of all six of the Funds in
this report. As of April 30, 2003, NQI and NPX had moved from trading at
discounts to their common share net asset values to trading


                                       3

<PAGE>

at premiums, NIO was trading at virtually the same level as its NAV, and NIF's
premium had widened. For NVG, the increase in NAV outpaced the rise in share
price, and this Fund was trading at a discount. Through April 30, 2003, NEA has
traded at a premium since its introduction in November 2002. (See charts on
individual Performance Overview pages.)

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE PERIOD ENDED
APRIL 30, 2003?

Over the reporting period, we continued to place strong emphasis on diversifying
the Funds' port-folios, enhancing call protection and supporting their future
dividend-paying capabilities. Since these Funds primarily hold insured bonds,
which are not subject to normal credit risk, our risk management efforts focused
on interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a Fund's
portfolio will decline when market interest rates rise (since bond prices move
in the opposite direction of interest rates). The longer the duration4 of a
Fund's portfolio, the greater its interest rate risk. Over the past year, we
worked systematically to shorten the Funds' durations, which we believe will
help us better control interest rate risk over time and enhance the Funds'
ability to produce attractive returns.

In line with our moderated duration strategy, we concentrated on finding value
in the long- intermediate part of the yield curve (i.e., bonds that mature in
about 20 years). In many cases, bonds in this part of the curve were offering
yields similar to those of longer bonds but had less inherent interest rate
risk. Over the period, the purchase of bonds in this part of the curve helped to
shorten the durations of these Funds, making their portfolios less sensitive to
any changes in the interest rate environment while still allowing them to
provide competitive yields.

In general, the heavy issuance in the municipal market over the past year
provided us with increased opportunities to purchase the types of insured bond
structures that we favor. We also continued to look for individual issues that
we believed would perform well regardless of the future direction of interest
rates. The four older Funds maintained their strong weightings


4    Duration is a measure of a Fund's NAV volatility in reaction to interest
     rate movements. Fund duration, also known as leverage-adjusted duration,
     takes into account the leveraging process for a Fund and therefore is
     generally longer than the duration of the actual portfolio of individual
     bonds that make up the Fund. References to duration in this commentary are
     intended to indicate Fund duration unless otherwise noted.

in healthcare bonds, the top performing group among the Lehman revenue sectors
for the twelve months ended April 30, 2003.

Given the current geopolitical and economic climate, we continued to believe
that strong credit quality remained a vital requirement for the Funds. As of
April 30, 2003, the four older Funds were 100% invested in AAA rated, U.S.
guaranteed and/or insured bonds. NVG and NEA held 93% and 99%, respectively, of
their portfolios in AAA rated bonds, although these two Funds are allowed to
invest up to 20% of their portfolios in non-insured but investment-grade quality
bonds. In addition, NEA may not invest in any bonds whose interest payments are
subject to the federal alternative minimum tax.

WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE MUNICIPAL MARKET IN GENERAL AND THESE FUNDS IN
PARTICULAR?
We think new issuance volume should remain strong, as issuers continue to take
advantage of the low rate environment. Adding to our expectations for continued
strong issuance are the budget deficits affecting many states, and their
continued need to raise money for infrastructure, education and healthcare
needs. Over coming months, we will continue to closely monitor the states'
budgetary situations to watch for any potential impact on credit ratings.

Looking at the bond call exposure, we believe that these Funds offer good levels
of call protection during the remainder of 2003 and through 2004. As of April
30, 2003, the portion of the four older Funds eligible for calls over this
period ranged from 8% to 12%. The two newer Funds - NVG and NEA - will not face
any significant call exposure for several years. The number of actual calls
during this time will depend largely on market interest rates and the specific
situations of individual issuers.

In the coming months, our primary goal will continue to be moderating the Funds'
durations. In addition, we plan to watch for opportunities to purchase or swap
for issues that we perceive to be under-valued, particularly in sectors of the
market that have recently underperformed. The expected strong supply of new
bonds should help us in this effort.

                    Insurance which ensures the timely payment of principal and
                    interest. Up to 20% of the Fund's net assets may be invested
                    in municipal securities that are (i) either backed by an
                    escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or
                    U.S. Government agency securities (also ensuring the timely
                    payment of principal and interest), or (ii) municipal bonds
                    that are rated, at the time of investment, within the four
                    highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, S&P or
                    Fitch) or unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by
                    the Adviser.

               (1)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are
                    based on net assets applicable to Common shares.

               **   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or Moody's
                    rating.

               +    Security has a maturity of more than one year, but has
                    variable rate and demand features which qualify it as a

                    At least 80% of the Fund's net assets are invested in
                    municipal securities that are either covered by Original
                    Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio
                    Insurance which ensures the timely payment of principal and
                    interest. Up to 20% of the Fund's net assets may be invested
                    in municipal securities that are (i) either backed by an
                    escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or
                    U.S. Government agency securities (also ensuring the timely
                    payment of principal and interest), or (ii) municipal bonds
                    that are rated, at the time of investment, within the four
                    highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, S&P or
                    Fitch) or unrated but judged to be of comparable quality by
                    the Adviser.

               (1)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are
                    based on net assets applicable to Common shares.

               *    Optional Call Provisions: Dates (month and year) and prices
                    of the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be
                    other call provisions at varying prices at later dates.

               **   Ratings: Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or Moody's
                    rating.

               +    Security has a maturity of more than one year, but has
                    variable rate and demand features which qualify it as a
                    short-term security. The rate disclosed is that currently in
                    effect. This rate changes periodically based on market
                    conditions or a specified market index.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The National Funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding
Common share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund,
Inc. (NQI), Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen
Premier Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income
Municipal Fund 2 (NPX), Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG)
and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA). Insured Quality
(NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF) and Insured
Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange while Insured
Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) are traded on the
American Stock Exchange. The Funds are registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified management investment
companies.

Prior to the commencement of operations of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and
Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA), the Funds had no operations other than those
related to organizational matters, the initial capital contribution of $100,275
per Fund by Nuveen Advisory Corp. (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of
Nuveen Investments, Inc. (formerly, The John Nuveen Company), and the recording
of the organization expenses ($11,500 per Fund) and its reimbursement by Nuveen
Investments, LLC (formerly, Nuveen Investments), also a wholly owned subsidiary
of Nuveen Investments, Inc.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Securities Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon,
maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers and general
market conditions. If it is determined that market prices for a security are
unavailable or inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or
its designee, may establish a fair value for the security. Temporary investments
in securities that have variable rate and demand features qualifying them as
short-term securities are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market
value.

Securities Transactions

Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from such transactions are determined on the specific identification
method. Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis
may have extended settlement periods. The securities so purchased are subject to
market fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian
to segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2003,
Insured Opportunity (NIO) had outstanding when-issued purchase commitments of
$6,508,005. At April 30, 2003, there were no such outstanding purchase
commitments in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its net investment
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required. Furthermore, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable
interest from municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed
to shareholders of the Funds.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared and paid monthly.
Net realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions,
if any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.


                                       52

<PAGE>

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.
Each Fund's Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The dividend
rate on each Series may change every seven days, as set pursuant to a dutch
auction process by the auction agent, and is payable at or near the end of each
rate period. The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total,
for each Fund is as follows:

</TABLE>

Effective January 17, 2003, Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) issued 2,880 Series
T and 2,880 Series W, $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.

Insurance

Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) invest in municipal securities which are
either covered by insurance or are backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both
of which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) invest at
least 80% of their net assets in municipal securities that are covered by
insurance. Each Fund may also invest up to 20% of its net assets in municipal
securities which are either (i) backed by an escrow or trust containing
sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, or (ii)
municipal bonds that are rated, at the time of investment, within the four
highest grades (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch) or unrated but
judged to be of comparable quality by the Adviser.

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance is effective only while the municipal securities are held by the
Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the market value of
the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net asset value of the
Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio Insurance. Each
policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds the right to
obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security covered by the
Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments including
futures, forward, swap and option contracts, and other financial instruments
with similar characteristics. Although the Funds are authorized to invest in
such financial instruments, and may do so in the future, they did not make any
such investments during the period ended April 30, 2003.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Offering Costs

Nuveen Investments, LLC has agreed to pay all Common share offering costs (other
than the sales load) that exceed $.03 per Common share for Insured Dividend
Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA). Insured Dividend
Advantage's (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage's (NEA) share of Common share
offering costs ($614,079 and $555,000, respectively) were recorded as a
reduction of the proceeds from the sale of Common shares.

Costs incurred by Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) in connection with their offering of Preferred shares
($2,600,117 and $3,121,000, respectively) were recorded as a reduction to
paid-in surplus.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

SIDEBAR TEXT: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.


NUVEEN CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase price
per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBILITY

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

For more information on the Nuveen Automatic Reinvestment Plan or to enroll in
or withdraw from the Plan, speak with your financial advisor or call us at (800)
257-8787.

POLICY CHANGE

On November 14, 2002, the Board adopted a policy that allows these Funds, in
addition to investments in municipal bonds, to invest up to 5% of its net assets
(including assets attributable to preferred shares, if any) in tax-exempt or
taxable fixed-income securities or equity securities for the purpose of
acquiring control of an issuer whose municipal bonds (a) the Fund already owns
and (b) have deteriorated or are expected shortly to deteriorate significantly
in credit quality, provided Nuveen Advisory determines that such investment
should enable the Fund to better maximize the value of its existing investment
in such issuer. This policy is a non-fundamental policy of each Fund which means
that it can be changed at any time by the Board of Trustees without vote of the
shareholders.


GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

Average Annual Total Return: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return (including change in NAV and reinvested dividends) that
would have been necessary on an annual basis to equal the investment's actual
performance over the time period being considered.

Average Effective Maturity: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

Leverage-Adjusted Duration: Duration is a measure of a bond or bond fund's
sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond or fund's
duration, the more the price of the bond or fund will change as interest rates
change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for
a Fund and therefore is generally longer than the duration of the actual
portfolio of individual bonds that make up the Fund.

Market Yield (also known as Dividend Yield or Current Yield): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

Net Asset Value (NAV): A fund's NAV is calculated by subtracting the liabilities
of the fund from its total assets and then dividing the remainder by the number
of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

Taxable-Equivalent Yield: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

- ---------
Each Fund intends to repurchase shares of its own common or preferred stock in
the future at such times and in such amounts as is deemed advisable. No shares
were repurchased during the six-month period ended April 30, 2003. Any future
repurchases will be reported to shareholders in the next annual or semiannual
report.
