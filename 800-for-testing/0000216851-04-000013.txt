reinvestment of dividends are assumed as $2.50 per reinvestment and commissions
of $0.05 per share. No adjustment has been made for any income taxes payable by
stockholders on income dividends or on capital gains distributions or the sale
of any shares. These results should not be considered representative of the
dividend income or capital gain or loss which may be realized in the future.

                            LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Each year at this time, we share with you our perspective on the past year and
provide our view on the energy markets and outlook for the ensuing year. As
noted on the cover of this report, your fund is observing its seventy-fifth
anniversary this year. In January 1929, an offering of 3,250,000 shares was
made to the public, creating the first and only closed-end sector fund focused
on natural resources. Petroleum & Resources is one of only six closed-end funds
to survive from that era to today.

THE YEAR IN REVIEW
Performance

The Petroleum & Resources fund performed well in 2003. The total return on net
assets, including income and capital gains distributions for the calendar year
was 21.2%. On a market value basis, the total return was 30.8%. Comparable
figures for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the Dow Jones Energy Index were
28.7% and 22.9%, respectively. Double digit gains in the energy sector in
December allowed the sector to significantly narrow the performance gap versus
the strong broader market.

As noted above, after two years of declines, the energy stocks and the broader
market posted strong gains. Within the Dow Jones Energy Index, the pipeline
stocks rose 78% for the year, as the industry began rebuilding following the
energy trading issues of the prior two years. Exploration companies in the
Index were up 29%, the major oil companies were up 22%, and the oil drilling
group was up 14%. The coal stocks represented in the Index had an outstanding
year, advancing 60%. With our substantial holdings in international companies
such as Royal Dutch and BP, which are not included in the Energy Index and
underperformed it, the net asset value return for Petroleum & Resources was
slightly below that of the Index. Most of our holdings outside of the segments
represented in the Energy Index also performed well during the year. Our water
utility holding provided a 31% return and our diverse holdings in basic
industry and industrials had solid gains as well, led by the 57% return in
machinery. Offsetting these to some degree was the performance of our natural
gas utility holdings, which were only up 18% for the year. While this would
normally be an outstanding result for this group, the advances of the other
sectors overshadowed it.

Surging prices for both crude oil and natural gas provided a positive operating
environment for energy companies throughout the year. Energy stocks
outperformed the weak broader market in the first quarter as the cold weather
in the Northeast and the anticipation of military action in Iraq drove
commodity prices higher. The S&P 500 Index declined 3.2% through March while
energy stocks fell less than 1%. Energy equities moved higher in April as oil
prices moved over $30 per barrel again, but the broader market outpaced this
sector. Though both oil and natural gas prices remained strong through the rest
of the year, stocks in the group underperformed the overall market through
November. Other sectors, including consumer, information technology and
industrial stocks, performed well, reflecting the strong economic recovery. In
December, however, energy stocks once again outperformed the broader market in
response to higher commodity prices. For the month, the sector advanced 13.5%
while the S&P 500 rose only 5.2%.


Oil Industry

Crude oil prices averaged over $30 per barrel in 2003, the highest yearly
average in over 20 years. Prices spiked to over $39 per barrel early in 2003,
as the consequence of suspected Iraqi weapons violations became clear. The
anticipation of the U.S. invasion created supply uncertainty at the same time
that Venezuelan production was curtailed due to civil unrest. Oil prices peaked
in February, and declined to a low of $25 in April as the conflict in Iraq
ended and rebuilding talks began. Increased production by the other OPEC
countries as well as countries such as Russia helped offset the production lost
from Iraq and the workers' strike in Venezuela. The higher production levels by
OPEC were confirmed when the organization met in April and agreed to increase
its quota to 25.4 million barrels per day. The oil price correction was
short-lived, however, as it became apparent that Iraqi production would not
return quickly due to on-going sabotage of facilities and pipelines. Oil prices
quickly jumped back to the $32 level and traded above $30 per barrel for much
of the remainder of 2003. Iraq's production was slow in rebuilding and
instability in Venezuela and Nigeria continued to disrupt supplies. Russia's
exports increased 9% during the year, adding to the worldwide supply. A brief
price drop to the $27 level occurred late in the summer and into September.
OPEC responded quickly by reducing its quota to 24.5 million barrels a day and
the price rally resumed. While supply issues dominated the market, record
demand in the U.S. and China contributed to the high prices. The beginning,
ending and average prices for oil were all in the $31 range for 2003.

Natural Gas and Coal

Natural gas prices increased sharply early in the year from $4.25 per mcf in
January to a spike of $8.50 in March. A decline in deliverability and the
sustained cold weather in the Northeast led to the commodity price rally as
inventories dropped to near record lows. As the heating season concluded, gas
prices dropped to

                                                                             3

the $5 level and traded in a fairly narrow band for most of the remainder of
the year. The cool summer enabled gas to be directed to the inventory rebuild
and by fall gas in storage had reached normal levels. The U.S. industrial
recovery contributed to rising demand and provided upward price bias. Gas
prices were volatile but remained high through the end of 2003, despite full
storage and mild weather. In this high price environment, liquefied natural gas
(LNG) imports were attractive and provided 1% of U.S. demand for the year. Coal
prices also experienced a strong recovery in 2003 in response to gas prices,
weather and increased demand.

INVESTMENT RESULTS

Net assets of the Corporation on December 31, 2003 were $522,941,279 or $24.06
per share on 21,736,777 shares outstanding. This compares with $451,275,463 or
$20.98 per share on 21,510,067 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2003 was $8,134,186 compared to $8,983,077 for 2002.
These earnings are equivalent to $0.38 and $0.42 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. In 2003, our
0.74% expense ratio (expenses to average net assets) was once again at a low
level compared to the industry.

Net realized gains amounted to $17,219,079 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments increased from $118,780,607 at December
31, 2002 to $185,072,550 at year end, a 56% increase.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Total dividends and distributions paid in 2003 were $1.19 per share compared to
$1.11 in 2002. As announced on November 13, 2003, a year-end distribution
consisting of investment income of $0.08 and capital gains of $0.72 was made on
December 27, 2003, both realized and taxable in 2003. On January 8, 2004, an
additional distribution of $0.13 per share was declared payable March 1, 2004,
representing the balance of undistributed net investment income and capital
gains earned in 2003 and an initial distribution from 2004 net investment
income, all taxable to shareholders in 2004.

OUTLOOK FOR 2004
Crude Oil

OPEC's recent guidance has called for a production increase when prices close
above the $22-$28 target range for 20 days. The target range has been exceeded
for more than 20 days, yet OPEC remains firm on the quota and has not increased
production, causing oil prices to move higher early in 2004. The resolve to
maintain the current quota is based on the weak dollar and the desire to
maximize revenues before the anticipated demand decline in the spring. OPEC
nations believe that higher oil prices are justified because the declining U.S.
dollar has lowered their purchasing power. In the first quarter, prices are
expected to remain high in response to higher economic demand and weather
factors. As demand declines seasonally in the spring, prices should respond.
The OPEC 10 (excluding Iraq) appear inclined towards cutting their production
in 2004 in order to maintain the desired price range and allow for incremental
Iraqi production.

The anticipated return of Iraq to pre-war production levels during the year as
well as rising exports from Venezuela and Nigeria will require quota
adjustments. The timing of Iraq's return to over 2 million barrels of
production per day is dependent on the ability to secure the pipelines. As
those volumes return and we move into a weak demand period, oil prices are
expected to fall from the year-end price of over $32 to a price range of
$25-$28 this year. While lower prices are anticipated, the decline in prices
may be hindered by the low inventory levels in the industrialized countries and
the expected worldwide demand increase of over 1 million barrels per day. The
apparent demand recovery in the face of $30 oil prices creates the possibility
that prices will stay in the upper end of the range. Against the backdrop of
rising demand, supply growth appears manageable throughout the year. Non-OPEC
production gains of over 1 million barrels per day combined with OPEC
cooperation should provide a balance for oil markets. The extent of the
worldwide recovery and geopolitical issues in the Middle East, Nigeria and
Venezuela will ultimately determine oil prices for 2004.

Natural Gas

The year began with a first day jump of 10% in natural gas prices as
expectations that weather-related demand will be strong and economic indicators
confirmed a U.S. recovery. The outlook for early 2004 is for natural gas prices
to remain in the $5-$6 per mcf range until winter ends and decline to an
average of $4.25-$4.75 by year-end. A repeat of last year's heating demand
would put an upward bias on prices. Volatility will remain high due to weather
sensitivity and the fuel switching ability of natural gas users. Demand and
prices will be driven by the economic recovery and a gas price that is too high
may result in demand reduction. LNG will continue to provide a viable source to
meet natural gas demand, as will incremental gas production from the Rocky
Mountains. LNG imports are expected to increase in 2004 and larger supplies are
necessary to satisfy future U.S. demand. Similarly, the competitive position of
coal has and will continue to benefit from rising natural gas demand, resulting
in increased coal consumption by electric utilities. These

higher than historic natural gas prices will provide an attractive environment
for increasing deliverability in the United States.

Corporate Governance

There has been a great deal of attention recently paid to illegal and unethical
activities in the mutual fund industry. We feel it is important to remind our
shareholders that we condemn the activities that have been uncovered and assure
you that we have not engaged in them. Since your fund's shares are publicly
traded, trading arrangements that benefit some shareholders over others are not
possible. Thus, should they wish to do so, all of our shareholders are able to
make after-hours trades, to engage in rapid trading of our shares, and to
attempt to time trades, and no shareholders are given special privileges in
this regard. While we maintain relationships with many brokerage houses and
encourage them to recommend Petroleum & Resources as an investment, we do not
make "soft dollar" payments to brokers for this purpose. All commissions paid
on buying or selling stocks for the portfolio are reviewed by the Board of
Directors quarterly. Our use of commission dollars to pay for important
research to better enable our analysts to make their stock selections is
conducted in strict accordance with applicable SEC rules.

Two new Directors were elected to the Board, effective November 13, 2003,
bringing the total number to thirteen. Ms. Phyllis O. Bonanno, President of
International Trade Solutions, Inc., brings wide experience in global trade to
the Board, while Ms. Kathleen T. McGahran, Principal and Director of Pelham
Associates, adds a wealth of specialized knowledge in accounting to our range
of skills. All of the Directors except myself qualify as independent directors
by SEC definition, and thus more than 90% of the Board consists of directors
who are independent of management. In addition to monthly meetings of the full
Board of Directors, the independent Directors meet separately every other month.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

On December 11, 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of an additional 5% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation
over the ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the same
restriction as in the past, namely that shares can only be repurchased as long
as the discount of the market price of the shares from the net asset value is
8% or greater.

From the beginning of 2004 through February 12, 2004, no shares have been
repurchased under the program.

                                  ----------

The proxy statement for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in
Baltimore, Maryland on March 30, 2004, will be mailed on or about February 20,
2004 to holders of record on February 13, 2004.

By order of the Board of Directors,

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation's investment objectives as well as the nature and risk of its
investment transactions are set forth in the Corporation's registration
statement.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on national securities
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions And Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities, including options, at December 31, 2003 was $360,929,608, and net
unrealized appreciation aggregated $185,102,373, of which the related gross
unrealized appreciation and depreciation were $205,468,433 and $20,366,060,
respectively. As of December 31, 2003, the tax basis of distributable earnings
was $967,194 of undistributed ordinary income and $1,453,807 of undistributed
long-term capital gain.

Distributions paid by the Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2003
were classified as ordinary income of $8,321,192 and capital gain of
$17,048,026. The distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are made within the Corporation's
capital accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution under
income tax regulations.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Corporation's investment decisions are made by a committee, and no one
person is primarily responsible for making recommendations to that committee.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the year ended December 31, 2003 were $41,449,731 and
$65,509,697, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. The Corporation, as writer of an option, bears the market risk of
an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written
option. The risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium
originally paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of December 31,
2003 can be found on page 15.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
year ended December 31, 2003 were as follows:

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The cost of the 14,900 shares of Common Stock held by the Corporation at
December 31, 2002 amounted to $285,217. There were no shares held at December
31, 2003.

The Corporation has an employee incentive stock option and stock appreciation
rights plan which provides for the issuance of options and stock appreciation
rights for the purchase of up to 895,522 shares of the Corporation's Common
Stock at 100% of the fair market value at date of grant. Options are
exercisable beginning not less than one year after the date of grant and extend
and vest over ten years from the date of grant. Stock appreciation rights are
exercisable beginning not less than two years after the date of grant and
extend over the period during which the option is exercisable. The stock
appreciation rights allow the holders to surrender their rights to exercise
their options and receive cash or shares in an amount equal to the difference
between the option price and the fair market value of the common stock at the
date of surrender.

Under the plan, the exercise price of the options and related stock
appreciation rights is reduced by the per share amount of capital gain paid by
the Corporation during subsequent years. At the beginning of 2003, there were
152,012 options outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $18.07
per share. During 2003, the Corporation granted options, including stock
appreciation rights, for 21,258 shares of common stock with an exercise price
of $19.29 per share. During the year, stock appreciation rights relating to
17,880 stock option shares were exercised at a weighted average market price of
$20.24 per share and the stock options relating to these rights which had a
weighted average exercise price of $10.21 per share were cancelled. In
addition, stock options and stock appreciation rights relating to 25,943
shares, and with a weighted average exercise price of $19.46 per share, were
cancelled. At December 31, 2003, there were 38,866 outstanding exercisable
options to purchase common shares at $8.31-$24.53 per share (weighted average
price of $18.05) and unexercisable options to purchase 90,581 common shares at
$10.92-$24.53 per share (weighted average price of $18.48). The weighted
average remaining contractual life of outstanding exercisable and unexercisable
options was 5.17 years and 6.18 years, respectively. The total compensation
expense recognized in 2003 for the stock option and stock appreciation rights
plan was $367,322. At December 31, 2003, there were 279,614 shares available
for future option grants.

5. RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation provides retirement benefits for its employees under a
non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan. The benefits are based
on years of service and compensation during the last five years of employment.
The Corporation's current funding policy is to contribute annually to the plan
only those amounts that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. As of
December 31, 2003, the plan assets consisted of investments in Adams Express
Co. stock (7%), other individual stocks (60%), and mutual funds (33%).

The actuarially computed net pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2003
was $807,407, and consisted of service cost of $122,531, interest cost of
$234,808, expected return on plan assets of $235,114, net amortization expense
of $218,077, and loss on settlement of $467,105, due to lump-sum distributions.

In determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation,
the interest rate used for the weighted average discount rate was 6.75%, the
expected rate of annual salary increases was 7.0%, and the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets was 8.0%.

On January 1, 2003, the projected benefit obligation for service rendered to
date was $4,149,034. During 2003, the projected benefit obligation increased
due to service cost and interest cost of $122,531 and $234,808, respectively,
and decreased due to benefits paid in the amount of $88,577 and the effect of a
settlement of $857,753. The projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2003
was $3,560,043.

On January 1, 2003, the fair value of plan assets was $3,861,986. During 2003,
the fair value of plan assets increased due to the expected return on plan
assets of $235,114 and decreased due to benefits paid in the amount of $88,577
and the effect of a settlement of $1,171,699. At December 31, 2003, the fair
value of plan assets amounted to $2,836,824, which resulted in a deficit in
plan assets of $723,219. The remaining components of prepaid pension cost at
December 31, 2003 included $1,230,167 in unrecognized loss and $224,073 in
unrecognized prior service cost. Prepaid pension cost included in other assets
at December 31, 2003 was $731,021.

In addition, the Corporation has a nonqualified benefit plan which provides
employees with defined retirement benefits to supplement the qualified plan.
The Corporation does not provide postretirement medical benefits.

6. EXPENSES

The cumulative amount of accrued expenses at December 31, 2003 for employees
and former employees of the Corporation was $1,443,431. Aggregate remuneration
paid or accrued during the year ended December 31, 2003 to key employees and
directors amounted to $1,364,126.

7. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts
for securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives
compensation in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the
investment of any cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues
to receive interest or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are
secured by collateral of at least 102%, at all times, of the fair value of the
securities loaned plus accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of
securities loaned that may occur during the term of the loan will be for the
account of the Corporation. At December 31, 2003, the Corporation had
securities on loan of $21,860,647, and held collateral of $22,322,240,
consisting of repurchase agreements and commercial paper.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(hereafter referred to as the "Corporation") at December 31, 2003, and the
results of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial
highlights for each of the fiscal periods presented, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Corporation's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

compares the net asset value at the close of the week's last business day to
the market price of the shares, and shows the amount of the discount or premium.

Petroleum's daily trading is shown in the stock tables of most daily
newspapers, usually with the abbreviated form "PetRs." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Corporation at
(800) 638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Petroleum stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept in
a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your dividend and capital gain
distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American Stock
Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided on page
19.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Petroleum
& Resources?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc., as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Petroleum is simple and is handled through our transfer agent.
The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of transfer. They
will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the transfer agent
stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer agent will send
you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your transfer.

Item 6. [Reserved by SEC for future use].

Item 7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and  Procedures
     for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES & PROCEDURES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (Petroleum) follows  long-
standing  general  guidelines for the  voting  of  portfolio
company  proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility
to  vote all such proxies. The portfolio company proxies are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Petroleum uses
its  own  staff of research analysts and portfolio managers.
In  making  the  decision to invest in  a  company  for  the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyzes  is
the integrity and competency of the companys management.  We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies  managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of  the  companys
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio  companys management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the companys management.   When  we
believe  that the managements recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio   company   managements
recommendation are:

Stock Options
Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the companys overall compensation scheme.  In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the companys stock.

Corporate Control/ Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a staggered board of directors. Staggered boards are used to
help  create a roadblock to a possible takeover of a company
or   to   entrench  incumbent  management  and   board.   In
conformance  with  that policy, we will  generally  vote  in
favor  of  shareholder proposals to eliminate the  staggered
election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a  companys
charter   that   can   be  characterized  as   anti-takeover
provisions.  For  example, we generally  vote  in  favor  of
stockholder  proposals to rescind or require  a  stockholder
vote  on  anti-takeover provisions such as poison pills  and
the like.

With  respect  to  so-called  golden  parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within  the authority of the companys management, under  the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually  are persuaded managements  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance   with   managements
recommendation on these types of proposals.

Form  N-CSR  disclosure requirement not yet  effective  with
respect to registrant.

Item 10. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As of February 26, 2004, an evaluation was performed
     under the supervision and with the participation of the
     officers of registrant, including the principal executive
     officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of the
     effectiveness  of registrants disclosure  controls  and
     procedures.  Based on that evaluation, the  registrants
     officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that, as of
     February 26, 2004, the registrants disclosure controls and
     procedures were reasonably designed so as to ensure that
     material information relating to the registrant is made
     known to the PEO and PFO.

  (b)   There  have  been  no  significant  changes  in  the
     registrants internal control over financial reporting (as
     defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
     1940  (17  CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred  during  the
     registrants  last fiscal half-year that has  materially
     affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
     registrants internal control over financial reporting.

Item 11. Exhibits.

     (a)(1)  As  indicated in Item 2, the code of ethics  is
posted on the registrants website.

      (2) The certifications of the PEO and PFO pursuant  to
Rule  30a-2(a) under the Investment Company Act of 1940  are
attached hereto as Exhibit 99 CERT.

  (c)  The certifications of the PEO and PFO pursuant to Rule
     30a-2(b)  under the Investment Company Act of 1940  are
     attached hereto as Exhibit 99.906 CERT.
