Semi-Annual Report
This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
World Dollar Government Fund II (the "Fund") for the semi-annual reporting
period ended September 30, 2003.

Investment Objective and Policies
This closed-end fund is designed for investors who seek high current income and,
secondarily, capital appreciation. To achieve this objective, it invests
primarily in high yielding, high risk sovereign debt and U.S. corporate
fixed-income obligations that we expect to benefit from improving economic and
credit fundamentals.

Investment Results
The following table shows the Fund's performance over the six- and 12-month
periods ended September 30, 2003. For comparison, we have included the J.P.
Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+), which is a standard measure
of the performance of a basket of unmanaged emerging market debt securities.

   The Fund's Market Price per share on September 30, 2003 was $12.36.

 * The Fund's investment results are for the periods shown and are based on
   the net asset value (NAV) of the Fund as of September 30, 2003. All fees and
   expenses related to the operation of the Fund have been deducted. Returns for
   the Fund include the reinvestment of any distributions paid during each
   period. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

   The J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus (JPM EMBI+) is comprised
   of dollar-denominated restructured sovereign bonds; a large percentage of the
   index is made up of Brady bonds. The index is unmanaged and reflects no fees
   or expenses. An investor cannot invest directly in an index, and its results
   are not indicative of any specific investment, including Alliance World
   Dollar Government Fund II.

The Fund significantly outperformed its benchmark, the JPM EMBI+, for both the
six- and 12-month periods ended September 30, 2003. The Fund benefited primarily
from its emerging market debt country weightings and individual security
selection. Country and security selection in the Fund's overweight allocation to
Brazil was the largest contributor to both absolute and relative performance for
the annual and semi-annual periods. Brazilian debt was also a top performer
within the JPM EMBI+. The Fund's overweight of Russia contributed positively to
performance, as prospects for rating agency upgrades reflected the success of
structural reforms that have led to economic growth and debt reduction. The
Fund's holdings of Uruguayan and Venezuelan debt also had a positive impact on
performance. Both countries conducted debt exchanges

during this period that significantly improved the maturity structure of their
external debt.

Market Review and Investment Strategy
During the semi-annual reporting period ended September 30, 2003, investors'
desire for higher yielding asset classes benefited the emerging debt markets, as
high levels of global liquidity encouraged more risk taking. The emerging market
debt class, as represented by the JPM EMBI+, returned a strong 13.73% for the
six-month period under review. Latin countries outperformed non-Latin regions,
posting returns of 15.61% and 11.19%, respectively. All countries represented
within the Index posted positive returns during the reporting period. Top
performing countries included Venezuela at 30.45%, Turkey at 30.29%, Ecuador at
23.77% and Brazil at 23.63%, while Bulgaria at 3.08%, Poland at 3.73% and South
Africa at 4.01% lagged.

During the semi-annual period, we increased the Fund's overweight exposure to
Brazilian sovereign bonds, as President Lula exceeded expectations in his
ability to push forward crucial tax and social security reforms. Russia and
Mexico continued to be a large percentage of the Fund's exposure; however, we
maintained an underweight of the latter, relative to the Index, as bond
valuations began to exceed interest rate risk. We have maintained the Fund's
overweight position in Russian sovereign debt, as credit statistics continued to
improve. The Fund's small position in Venezuela was increased once new
management of the state-owned oil company, PDVSA (Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.),
proved adept at improving oil production, which helped to augment international
reserves. In April, Uruguay, with the support of the International Monetary
Fund, announced an aggressive plan to swap its outstanding debt for longer
maturity securities. We aggressively purchased Uruguay bonds after this
announcement--a tactic that proved beneficial to the Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
September 30, 2003 (unaudited)


NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies
Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II (the "Fund") was incorporated under the
laws of the State of Maryland on May 20, 1993 and is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which
require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and
amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies followed by the Fund.

1. Security Valuation
In accordance with Pricing Policies adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Fund (the "Pricing Policies") and applicable law, portfolio securities are
valued at current market value or at fair value. The Board of Directors has
delegated to the Adviser, subject to the Board's continuing oversight, certain
responsibilities with respect to the implementation of the Pricing Policies.
Pursuant to the Pricing Policies, securities for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at their current market value. In general, the
market value of these securities is determined as follows:

Securities listed on a national securities exchange or on a foreign securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price at the close of the exchange or
foreign securities exchange. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such
day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day, then the security is
valued in good faith at fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies.
Securities listed on more than one exchange are valued by reference to the
principal exchange on which the securities are traded; securities not listed on
an exchange but traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued in
accordance with the NASDAQ Official Closing Price; listed put or call options
are valued at the last sale price. If there has been no sale on that day, such
securities will be valued at the closing bid prices on that day; open futures
contracts and options thereon are valued using the closing settlement price or,
in the absence of such a price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are
no quotations available for the day of valuations, the last available closing
settlement price is used; securities traded in the over-the-counter market, (but
excluding securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of the current bid
and asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or other
comparable sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt instruments having
60 days or less remaining until maturity are valued at amortized cost if their
original maturity was 60 days or less, or by amortizing their fair value as of
the 61st day prior to maturity if their original term to maturity exceeded 60
days; fixed-income securities, including mortgage backed and asset backed
securities, may be valued on the basis of prices

provided by a pricing service or at a price obtained from one or more of the
major broker/dealers. In cases where broker/dealer quotes are obtained, the
Pricing Policies provide that the Adviser may establish procedures whereby
changes in market yields or spreads are used to adjust, on a daily basis, a
recently obtained quoted price on a security; and OTC and other derivatives are
valued on the basis of a quoted bid price or spread from a major broker/dealer
in such security. Securities for which market quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies.


2. Taxes
It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income or excise taxes is
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions
Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the date securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and losses are
determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund accretes discounts as
adjustments to interest income. Additionally, the Fund amortizes premiums on
debt securities for financial statement reporting purposes.

4. Dividends and Distributions
Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. Income and capital gains distributions are determined in accordance with
federal tax regulations and may differ from those determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. To the extent
these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified within the
capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require such reclassification.

NOTE B
Advisory, Administrative Fees and Other Affiliated Transactions
Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays Alliance
Capital Management L.P. (the "Adviser") an advisory fee at an annual rate of 1%
of the Fund's average weekly net assets. Such fee is accrued daily and paid
monthly.

Under the terms of the Administration Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser an
administrative fee at an annual rate of .15 of 1% of the Fund's average weekly
net assets. Such fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. The Adviser provides
administrative functions as well as other clerical services to the Fund and
prepares financial and regulatory reports.

The Fund entered into a Shareholder Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance
Global Investor Services, Inc. (AGIS), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Adviser,

whereby the Fund reimburses AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone inquiries
on behalf of the Fund. During the six months ended September 30, 2003, there was
no reimbursement paid to AGIS.

Gross unrealized depreciation...........................        (6,855,990)
                                                           ---------------
Net unrealized appreciation.............................   $   164,010,644
                                                           ---------------

1. Option Transactions
For hedging and investment purposes, the Fund may purchase and write (sell) put
and call options on U.S. and foreign government securities and foreign
currencies that are traded on U.S. and foreign securities exchanges and
over-the-counter markets.

The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Fund pays a premium
whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund bears the risk of
loss of premium and change in market value should the counterparty not perform
under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for in the same
manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities acquired through the
exercise of call options is increased by premiums paid. The proceeds from
securities sold through the exercise of put options are decreased by the
premiums paid.

When the Fund writes an option, the premium received by the Fund is recorded as
a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of the
option written. Premiums received from written options which expire unexercised
are recorded by the Fund on the expiration date as realized gains from options
written. The difference between the premium received and the amount paid on
effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is
also treated as a realized gain, or if the premium received is less than the
amount paid for the closing purchase transaction, as a realized loss. If a call
option is exercised, the premium received is added to the proceeds from the sale
of the underlying security or currency in determining whether the Fund has real-


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II o 17



<PAGE>


ized a gain or loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium received reduces
the cost basis of the security or currency purchased by the Fund. In writing an
option, the Fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of
the security or currency underlying the written option. Exercise of an option
written by the Fund could result in the Fund selling or buying a security or
currency at a price different from the current market value.

Transactions in written options for the six months ended September 30, 2003,
were as follows:

                                             Number of        Premiums
                                             Contracts        Received

                                         ---------------   ---------------

2. Swap Agreements
The Fund may enter into swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rates and credit
risk or for investment purposes. A swap is an agreement that obligates two
parties to exchange a series of cash flows at specified intervals based upon or
calculated by reference to changes in specified prices or rates for a specified
amount of an underlying asset. The payment flows are usually netted against each
other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other.

Risks may arise as a result of the failure of the counterparty to the swap
contract to comply with the terms of the swap contract. The loss incurred by the
failure of a counterparty is generally limited to the net interest payment to be
received by the Fund, and/or the termination value at the end of the contract.
Therefore, the Fund considers the creditworthiness of each counterparty to a
swap contract in evaluating potential credit risk. Additionally, risks may arise
from unanticipated movements in interest rates or in the value of the underlying
securities.

The Fund records a net receivable or payable on a daily basis for the net
interest income or expense expected to be received or paid in the interest
period. Net interest received or paid on these contracts is recorded as interest
income (or as an offset to interest income). Fluctuations in the value of swap
contracts are recorded for financial statement purposes as a component of net
change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation of investments. Realized gains
and/or loss from terminated swap contracts are included in net realized gain or
loss on investment transactions.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18 o Alliance World Dollar Government Fund II


<PAGE>


The Fund may enter into credit default swaps. A sell/(buy) in a credit default
swap provides upon the occurrence of a credit event, as defined in the swap
agreement, for the Fund to buy/(sell) from/(to) the Counterparty at par and
take/(deliver) the principal amount (the "Notional Amount") of the referenced
obligation. During the term of the swap agreement, the Fund receives/(pays)
semi-annual fixed interest payments from/(to) the respective Counterparty,
calculated at the agreed upon interest rate applied to the Notional Amount.

Credit default swaps may involve greater risks than if a Fund had invested in
the referenced obligation directly. Credit default swaps are subject to general
market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. If the Fund is a buyer and no
credit event occurs, it will lose its investment. In addition, the value of the
referenced obligation received by the Fund as a seller if a credit event occurs,
coupled with the periodic payments previously received, may be less than the
full notional value it pays to the buyer, resulting in a loss of value to the
Fund.

3. Reverse Repurchase Agreements
Under a reverse repurchase agreement, the Fund sells securities and agrees to
repurchase them at a mutually agreed upon date and price. At the time the Fund
enters into a reverse repurchase agreement, it will establish a segregated
account with the custodian containing liquid assets having a value at least
equal to the repurchase price.

"Due from broker" shown on the statement of assets and liabilities represents
the receivable from the respective broker for the reverse repurchase agreements
enterd into on September 24, 2003.

For the six months ended September 30, 2003, the average amount of reverse
repurchase agreements outstanding was $87,633,544 and the daily weighted average
annualized interest rate was 1.01%.

NOTE D
Capital Stock
There are 100,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value common stock authorized. Of the
77,850,368 shares outstanding at September 30, 2003, the Adviser owned 7,200
shares. During the six months ended September 30, 2003 and the year ended March
31, 2003, the Fund issued no shares in connection with the Fund's dividend
reinvestment plan.

NOTE E
Concentration of Risk
Investing in securities of foreign companies and foreign governments involves
special risks, which include changes in foreign exchange rates and the
possibility of future political and economic developments which could adversely
affect the value of such securities. Moreover, securities of many foreign
companies and for-

eign governments and their markets may be less liquid and their prices more
volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies and the United States
government.

NOTE F
Distributions to Shareholders
The tax character of distributions to be paid for the year ending March 31, 2004
will be determined at the end of the current fiscal year. The tax character of
distributions paid during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2003 and March 31,
2002 were as follows:

                                              2003              2002
                                         --------------   ---------------
Distributions paid from:
   Ordinary income....................   $   82,323,739   $   101,219,354
                                         --------------   ---------------
Total taxable distributions...........       82,323,739       101,219,354
                                         --------------   ---------------
Total distributions paid..............   $   82,323,739   $   101,219,354
                                         --------------   ---------------
As of March 31, 2003, the components of accumulated earnings/(deficit) on a tax
basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income...........................   $    4,884,899
Accumulated capital and other losses....................     (354,176,827)(a)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)..................      189,475,023(b)
                                                           --------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)....................   $ (159,816,905)
                                                           --------------

(a) On March 31, 2003, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of
    $353,038,174 of which $103,516,115 expires in the year 2007, $43,184,734
    expires in the year 2008, $68,859,018 expires in the year 2009, $78,955,786
    expires in the year 2010 and $58,522,521 expires in the year 2011. To the
    extent future capital gains are offset by capital loss carryforwards, such
    gains will not be distributed. Net capital losses incurred after October 31,
    and within the taxable year are deemed to arise on the first business day of
    the Fund's next taxable year. For the year ended March 31, 2003, the Fund
    deferred to April 1, 2003, post October capital losses of $1,138,653.
(b) The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized
    appreciation/depreciation is attributable primarily to the tax deferral of
    losses on wash sales and the difference between book and tax amortization
    methods for premium.

(a) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund has adopted the provisions of
    the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide, Audits of Investment Companies, and
    began amortizing premium on debt securities for financial statement
    reporting purposes only. The effect of this change for the year ended March
    31, 2002 was to decrease net investment income per share by $.01, increase
    net realized and unrealized gain on investments per share by $.01, and
    decrease the ratio of net investment income to average net assets from
    12.74% to 12.69%. Per share, ratios and supplemental data for periods prior
    to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
    presentation.

(b) Based on average shares outstanding.

(c) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed, for
    purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
    Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Generally, total investment return based
    on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Total investment return calculated for
    a period of less than one year is not annualized.

(d) Annualized.

I, Marc O. Mayer, certify that:

1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR (the "Report") of Alliance World
     Dollar Government Fund II, Inc. (the "Fund");

2.   Based on my knowledge, this Report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     Report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial
     information included in this Report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the Fund as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this Report;

4.   The Fund's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing
     and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
     30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act) for the Fund and have:

         a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
              disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
              supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
              Fund, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
              by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
              which this Report is being prepared;

         b)   evaluated the effectiveness of the Fund's disclosure controls and
              procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
              effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a
              date within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Report based
              on such evaluation; and

         c)   disclosed in this Report any change in the Fund's internal control
              over financial reporting that occurred during the Fund's most
              recent fiscal half-year [or second fiscal half-year in the case of
              an annual report] that has materially affected, or is reasonably
              likely to materially affect, the Fund's internal control over
              financial reporting; and

5.   The Fund's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the Fund's
     auditors and the audit committee of the Fund's board of directors:

         a)   all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
              internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
              likely to adversely affect the Fund's ability to record, process,
              summarize, and report financial information; and

         b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
              other employees who have a significant role in the Fund's internal
              controls.
