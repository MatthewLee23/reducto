VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH

The NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

                                                                               1

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

During the six-month period ended January 31, 2006, positive economic and
corporate trends created a favorable backdrop for the senior loan asset class.
The Gulf Coast hurricanes did not dampen the U.S. economy to the extent some had
expected, nor did high oil prices and struggles of the auto industry. Inflation
remained largely contained. By and large, corporations posted good profits,
reflecting on-track business strategies, increasing revenues, strengthening
balance sheets and improving credit quality. Despite some well publicized
exceptions, corporate debt default rates remained low overall. These influences
stoked ongoing demand for senior loans, from institutional and individual
investors alike.

Moreover, the adjustable-rate characteristics of senior loans proved
particularly beneficial during the period. Because the yields of senior loans
adjust in tandem to changes in short-term interest rates, the asset class was
well positioned as interest rates rose across the short- and intermediate-term
portions of the bond market.

The strong demand for senior loans was met by robust supply in both the primary
and secondary markets. Merger-and-acquisition activity, leveraged buyouts
(private-to-public transactions), sponsor-driven dividend loans and second lien
loans were among the activities spurring issuance. In this environment, yield
spreads in the senior loan market held steady.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. For the six months ended January 31, 2006, the trust returned 2.93
percent on a market price basis and 3.45 percent on an NAV basis.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information.

We believe that the rigor of our approach and our experience in the senior loan
market were principal drivers of the trust's performance for the period. We
managed the trust according to our research-intensive, time-tested approach,
seeking to balance yield with a stable net asset value. Our investment process
focused on identifying companies that we believed had strong management, solid
and predictable cash flows, and sufficient collateral in the event of default.

Consistent with our dedication to risk management, we diversified the portfolio
broadly across the senior loan market. We followed a bottom-up security
selection process, with investment decisions driven principally by our analysis
of individual company fundamentals. That said, the portfolio construction
process also included our comprehensive analysis of larger industry and sector
trends. Notably, the trust's positioning reflected a defensive tilt throughout
the period. Our criteria led us to favor senior loans in sectors that typically
provide stable performance throughout an economic cycle. For example, the trust
includes debt issued by food, drug and beverage companies, cable broadcasters,
and leisure companies. These companies have historically enjoyed steady
day-to-day demand for goods and services. The trust also included holdings in
the defense industry; these issuers were well positioned to benefit from
long-term demand trends, and held extensive hard assets as loan collateral.

In contrast, we avoided companies we believed to be especially susceptible to
cyclical economic downturns or rising fuel prices. We were particularly
circumspect in regard to the highly leveraged auto and airline industries. This
prudence served the trust well during the period. We were extremely cautious
about the health care sector as well, based on concerns that an uncertain

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

regulatory environment and Medicaid reduction initiatives could create ongoing
turbulence for the sector.

The trust benefited during the period from our use of leverage. Leverage
involves borrowing at a short-term lending rate and reinvesting the proceeds at
a higher rate. We used this strategy on an ongoing basis in an effort to enhance
the trust's dividend. Unlike with other fixed-income classes, using leverage in
conjunction with senior loans does not involve the same degree of risk from
rising short-term interest rates, since the income from senior loans adjusts to
changes in interest rates, as do the rates which determine the trust's borrowing
costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates fall, borrowing costs would also
decline.) We might reduce leverage in periods of weaker credit quality
conditions to prevent magnifying erosion of the trust's net asset value.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform well
or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in the future.

CHANGES TO INVESTMENT POLICIES

At a meeting held on March 1, 2006, the Board of Trustees approved changes to
certain of the Trust's investment policies in order to expand the investment
options available to the Trust as the Trust seeks to achieve its investment
objective of high level of current income, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust's investment policy of investing at least 80% of its total
assets in Senior Loans remains unchanged. The changes to the Trust's investment
policies are as follows:

(1) The Trust may, subject to the limits specified below, invest in
credit-linked deposits. Credit-linked deposits are deposits by lenders, such as
the Trust, to support the issuance of letters of credit to the Senior Loan
borrower. The Trust receives from the bank issuing such letters of credit an
agreed upon rate of return in exchange for its deposit. There are risks
associated with credit-linked deposits, including the credit risk of the bank
which maintains the deposit account as well as the credit risk of the borrower.
The Trust bears the risk of possible loss of its principal investment, in
addition to the periodic interest payments that are expected to be received for
the duration of the Trust's investment in the credit-linked deposit. Thus,
restating the Trust's investment policies to include this new investment: The
Trust may invest up to 20% of its total assets in any combination of (1)
warrants and equity securities, in each case the Trust must own or acquire a
Senior Loan of the same issuer, (2) junior debt securities or securities with a
lien on collateral lower than a senior claim on collateral, (3) high quality
short-term debt securities, (4) credit-linked deposits and (5) Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities ("U.S. TIPS") and other inflation-indexed bonds
issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities.

(2) The Trust's ability to invest in structured products has been increased to
10% of its total assets and expanded to include credit default swaps ("CDS") to
enhance the yield on its portfolio or to increase income available for

 4
<PAGE>

distributions or for other non-hedging purposes. A CDS is an agreement between
two parties to exchange the credit risk of a particular issuer or reference
entity. In a CDS transaction, a buyer pays periodic fees in return for a payment
by the seller which is contingent upon an adverse credit event occurring in the
underlying issuer or reference entity. The seller collects periodic fees from
the buyer and profits if the credit of the underlying issuer or reference entity
remains stable or improves while the swap is outstanding, but the seller in a
CDS contract would be required to pay an agreed upon amount to the buyer in the
event of an adverse credit event in the reference entity. A buyer of a CDS is
said to buy protection whereas a seller of a CDS is said to sell protection.
When the Trust buys a CDS, it is utilizing the swap for hedging purposes similar
to other hedging strategies described herein. When the Trust sells a CDS, it is
utilizing the swap to enhance the yield on its portfolio to increase income
available for distribution or for other non-hedging purposes, and the Trust is
subject to the 10% limitation described herein on structured products.

                                                                               5

       filed on Form N-CSR. Van Kampen also delivers the semiannual and annual
       reports to trust shareholders, and makes these reports available on its
       public Web site, www.vankampen.com. In addition to the semiannual and
       annual reports that Van Kampen delivers to shareholders and makes
       available through the Van Kampen public Web site, each trust files a
       complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the trust's
       first and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q. Van Kampen does not deliver
       the reports for the first and third fiscal quarters to shareholders, nor
       are the reports posted to the Van Kampen public Web site. You may,
       however, obtain the Form N-Q filings (as well as the Form N-CSR and
       N-CSRS filings) by accessing the SEC's Web site, http://www.sec.gov. You
       may also review and copy them at the SEC's Public Reference Room in
       Washington, DC. Information on the operation of the SEC's Public
       Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330. You
       can also request copies of these materials, upon payment of a duplicating
       fee, by electronic request at the SEC's e-mail address
       (publicinfo@sec.gov) or by writing the Public Reference section of the
       SEC, Washington, DC 20549-0102.

NR--Not rated

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade.

    Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets applicable
    to common shares.

(a) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(b) A portion of this security is segregated in connection with unfunded
    commitments.

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(e) Non-income producing security as this stock or warrant currently does not
    declare dividends.

(f) Restricted Security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 0.04%
    of the net assets applicable to common shares of the Trust.

(g) Payment-in-kind security.

(h) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2006.

(i) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(j) The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

*   Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Trust's
    portfolio may be

    substantially less than the stated maturities shown. Although the Trust is
    unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining maturity of individual
    Senior Loans, the Trust estimates that the actual average maturity of the
    Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks and (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
    are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

(a)Total return based on common share market price assumes an investment at the
   common share market price at the beginning of the period indicated,
   reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
   Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the closing
   common share market price at the end of the period indicated.

(b)Calculation includes the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of
   senior loan interests.

(c)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   Borrowings) from the Trust's total assets and dividing by the total number of
   senior indebtedness units, where one unit equals $1,000 of senior
   indebtedness.

(d)As required, effective August 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   amortizing premium on fixed income securities. The effect of this change for
   the year ended July 31, 2002 was to decrease the ratio of net investment
   income to average net assets applicable to common shares by .01%. Net
   investment income per share and net realized and unrealized gains and losses
   per share were unaffected by the adjustments. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for the periods prior to July 31, 2002 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(e)Ratios do not reflect the effect of distributions to preferred shareholders.

(f)Ratios reflect the effect of distributions to preferred shareholders.

(g)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to seek
to provide a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a
portfolio of interests in floating or variable rate senior loans to
corporations, partnerships and other entities which operate in a variety of
industries and geographical regions. The Trust borrows money for investment
purposes which will create the opportunity for enhanced return, but also should
be considered a speculative technique and may increase the Trust's volatility.
The Trust commenced investment operations on June 24, 1998.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans are valued by the Trust following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Trust's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate, interest rate
redetermination period and maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the
current interest rate, the period until next interest rate redetermination and
the maturity of such Senior Loan. Consideration of comparable instruments may
include commercial paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term
variable rate securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior
Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and
approved by the Trust's Valuation Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED) continued

physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the
custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the underlying
security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees received are
treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note, or other
fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees
which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for
agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2005, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $211,408,105, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are to be distributed at least annually to common shareholders.
Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may include short term
capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

                                                                              39

                                                                $102,806,311

    As of July 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                                             <C>
Undistributed ordinary income...............................    $5,272,503
Long-term capital gain......................................       -0-
</Table>

    Net realized gains and losses may differ for financial and tax reporting
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions and other losses that were recognized for book purposes but
not tax purposes at the end of the fiscal year.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

    For the six months ended January 31, 2006, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $77,400 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, and Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO")
Employment agreements, the Adviser provides legal services and the CCO provides
compliance services to the Trust. The costs of these services are allocated to
each trust. For the six months ended January 31, 2006, the Trust recognized
expenses of approximately $81,100, representing Van Kampen Investment Inc.'s or
its affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of providing legal services to
the Trust, as well as, the salary, benefits and related costs of the CCO and
related support staff paid by Van Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the
Legal Services agreement are reported as part of "Legal" expenses on the
Statement of Operations. Services provided pursuant to the CCO Employment
agreement are reported as part of "Other" expenses on the Statement of
Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable for a ten-year period
and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust. The maximum
annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the costs of purchases and proceeds from investments sold and
repaid, excluding short-term investments, were $1,072,922,357 and
$1,070,577,444, respectively.

4. COMMITMENTS

Pursuant to the terms of certain Senior Loan agreements, the Trust had unfunded
loan commitments of approximately $156,876,500 as of January 31, 2006. The Trust
intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating cash,
liquid securities and liquid Senior Loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $2,504,560 as of January 31, 2006 is
reported as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

5. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Trust invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party
to the primary lending syndicate of a Variable Rate Senior Loan interest to
United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and other entities. When
the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Trust and the borrower.

                                                                              41

6. BORROWINGS

The Trust may utilize financial leverage to the maximum extent allowable under
the 1940 Act, as amended. Under the 1940 Act, as amended, a fund generally may
not (i) borrow money greater than 33 1/3% of the fund's total assets or (ii)
issue preferred shares greater than 50% of the fund's total assets. In using a
combination of borrowing money and issuing preferred shares, the maximum
allowable leverage is somewhere between 33 1/3% and 50% (but in no event more
that 50%) of the Fund's total assets based on the relative amounts borrowed or
preferred shares issued.

    The Trust has entered into a $700 million revolving credit and security
agreement. Annual commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of
the credit line. This revolving credit agreement is secured by the assets of the
Trust. For the six months ended January 31, 2006, the average daily balance of
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement was $562,005,435 with a weighted
average interest rate of 3.84%.

7. PREFERRED SHARES ISSUANCE

As of February 20, 2004 , the Trust issued 5,600 shares each of Series M, Series
T, Series W, Series TH and Series F Auction Preferred Shares ("APS"), $.01 Par
Value, $25,000 liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $700 million.
Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every seven
days through an auction process. The average rate in effect on January 31, 2006
was 4.198%. During the six months ended January 31, 2006, the rates ranged from
3.200% to 4.500%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of the "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

8. IDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of idemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.
