Nuveen Investments Municipal Closed-End Funds

Portfolio Manager's
          COMMENTS

PORTFOLIO MANAGER PAUL BRENNAN DISCUSSES U.S. ECONOMIC AND MUNICIPAL MARKET
CONDITIONS, KEY INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, AND THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE OF THESE SIX
INSURED FUNDS. WITH 17 YEARS OF INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING 15 YEARS AT
NUVEEN, PAUL ASSUMED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NQI, NIO, NIF, NPX,
NVG, AND NEA IN JULY 2006.

WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE ANNUAL
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2006?

In response to market concerns about oil prices, inflation, and the actions of
the Federal Reserve over the past 12 months, bond yields exhibited some
volatility during this reporting period, with longer-term rates hitting a peak
in June 2006 before falling sharply for the remainder of the period. For the
period as a whole, interest rates at the shorter end of the taxable yield curve
generally continued to rise, while longer rates ended the period close to where
they began it or even declined. As short-term rates approached and exceeded the
levels of long-term rates, the taxable yield curve became increasingly flat and
subsequently inverted. Consequently, bonds with longer durations 1 generally
outperformed those with shorter durations during this period.

Between November 1, 2005 and October 31, 2006, the Federal Reserve announced six
increases of 0.25% each in the fed funds rate before pausing to leave monetary
policy unchanged at the August-October 2006 sessions of its Open Market
Committee. The increases raised the short-term target by 150 basis points, from
3.75% to 5.25%, its highest level since March 2001. During this same period, the
yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose just four basis points to
end October 2006 at 4.60%. In contrast, in the municipal market, the yield on
the Bond Buyer 25 Revenue Bond Index, a widely followed measure of longer-term
municipal market rates, fell to 4.78% at the end of October 2006, a decline of
43 basis points from the end of October 2005.

Economic growth over the past year reflected the fluctuations in interest rates,
energy prices, and the effects of a softening housing market. After expanding at
a rate of 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2005, the U.S. gross domestic product
(GDP) rebounded sharply with a 5.6% gain in the first quarter of 2006 before
moderating to a pace of 2.6% in the second quarter of 2006 (all GDP numbers
annualized). In the third quarter of 2006, the rate of GDP growth slowed to
2.2%, largely as the result of an 18% slump in residential investment, the
largest decrease in 15 years. Despite the recent slowdown in economic

1     Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity as interest rates
      change, with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these
      changes than bonds with shorter durations.

growth, the markets continued to keep a close eye on inflation trends. While
declining energy prices contributed to a benign 1.3% year-over-year increase in
the Consumer Price Index as of October 2006, the core rate (which excludes food
and energy prices) rose 2.7% for the same period. In general, the jobs picture
remained positive, with national unemployment at 4.4% in October 2006, down from
4.9% in October 2005, the lowest level since May 2001.

Over the 12 months ended October 2006, municipal bond issuance nationwide
totaled $367.1 billion, down 8% from the previous 12 months. This total
reflected the general decrease in the supply of municipal paper during 2006.
After reaching record levels in calendar year 2005, municipal issuance declined
during the first 10 months of 2006, with $295.1 billion in new securities coming
to market, off 12.5% from the same period in 2005. A major factor in 2006's drop
was the sharp reduction in pre-refunding volume, which fell almost 50% from last
year's levels. Overall, demand for municipal bonds, especially those offering
higher yields, continued to be strong and broad-based, with retail investors,
institutional investors such as hedge funds and arbitragers, and foreign
participants all taking part in the market.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THIS REPORTING
PERIOD?

As the yield curve flattened over this 12-month period, we continued to
emphasize careful management of the Funds' underlying portfolios in line with
our established targets. This included pursuing a disciplined approach to
duration management and yield curve positioning throughout the period. As part
of this approach, we generally focused on purchasing bonds that we believed
provided attractive reward opportunities without excessive risk, emphasizing
attractively priced bonds with defensive coupons at or near the 20-year part of
the yield curve. For these Funds, our purchases of defensive coupon bonds
included bonds with premium coupons 2.

In recent months, we broadened our strategic scope in these six Funds to place
additional emphasis on income strategies by purchasing bonds that offered the
potential for more income such as zero coupon bonds, discount bonds and inverse
floaters. (Inverse floaters are bonds with coupons structured to move in the
opposite direction of short-term interest rates. For example, if short-term
market interest rates decline, the interest rate

2     Premium coupon bonds are credits that, at the time of purchase, are
      trading above their par values because their coupons are higher than
      current coupon levels. Historically, these bonds have held their value
      better than current coupon bonds when interest rates rise and bond values
      consequently fall.

                                                                               5

earned by the inverse floater will rise. An inverse floater increases the market
rate risk and duration of the investment.) Further, to help increase the Funds'
income-generating potential and better manage interest risk, we employed
additional tools such as interest rate swap agreements.

Although municipal bond issuance nationwide declined during this period, much of
the new paper was insured, so the reduction in supply did not have a major
impact on the implementation of this or other strategies we had planned for
these Funds, which invest entirely or predominantly in insured bonds. In
general, our new purchases centered on the essential services sectors, with an
emphasis on keeping the Funds well diversified geographically. The Funds also
continued to purchase paper issued in states such as California, New York and
Ohio. Because of the relatively higher income tax levels in specialty states,
municipal bonds issued in these states are generally in great demand by in-state
retail investors, which helps to support their value. These bonds also provide
additional liquidity, making it easier for us to execute trades as part of
implementing our strategies.

During this period, as part of our yield curve and income strategies, we were
also selling holdings with shorter durations, including pre-refunded bonds,
especially in NVG, as well as bonds with less attractive call features and
credits producing lower tax-exempt income streams. A portion of the proceeds
from these sales were reinvested out longer on the yield curve, which enabled us
to maintain the Funds' durations within our preferred strategic range and
contributed to their performance during this period.

At the beginning of this reporting period, NEA was using forward interest rate
swaps, a type of derivative financial instrument. As discussed in our last
shareholder report, we began using these swaps in late 2004 as part of our
duration management strategies in an effort to reduce some of the interest rate
risk in NEA. We believe this hedging strategy was effective in achieving the
intended goal of reducing the Funds' net asset value (NAV) volatility, and we
removed the hedges from NEA in September 2006.

HOW DID THE FUNDS PERFORM?

Individual results for these Funds, as well as relevant index and peer group
information, are presented in the accompanying table.

For the 12 months ended October 31, 2006, the total returns on NAV for all six
of the Funds in this report exceeded the return on the Lehman Brothers Insured
Municipal Bond Index. NVG and NEA outperformed the average return for the Funds'
insured Lipper peer group, while NIO performed in line with this return, and
NQI, NIF, and NPX trailed the peer group average for this period. For longer
periods, all the Funds outperformed the benchmark and the peer averages.

Factors that influenced the Funds' returns during this period included yield
curve positioning and duration management, implementation of income strategies,
the use of financial leverage, allocations to noninsured credits in NVG and NEA,
and advance refunding activity. 5

As longer-term municipal rates declined and the yield curve flattened over the
course of this period, yield curve and duration positioning played an important
role in the performance of these Funds. Overall, bonds with maturities between
one and four years were the most adversely impacted by changes in the interest
rate environment over this period, as interest rates in that part of the curve
rose. As a result, these shorter bonds generally underperformed longer bonds,
with the longest bonds (those with maturities of

      bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

4     The Lipper Insured Municipal Debt Funds category average is calculated
      using the returns of all closed-end funds in this category for each period
      as follows: 1 year, 26; 5 years, 21; and 10 years, 18. Fund and Lipper
      returns assume reinvestment of dividends.

5     Advance refundings, also known as pre-refundings or refinancings, occur
      when an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund principal and
      interest payments of older existing bonds. This process often results in
      lower borrowing costs for bond issuers.

                                                                               7

more than 22 years) achieving the best returns for the period. NIO, NVG, and NEA
had relatively more exposure to the longer part of the curve than NQI, NIF, and
NPX, which were hurt by their heavier exposure to the shorter end of the curve,
especially bonds with short call dates. We continued to work to strengthen the
yield curve positioning of all of these Funds.

As previously mentioned, in recent months we implemented additional income
strategies by adding zero coupon bonds, discount coupon bonds, and inverse
floaters to our portfolios, all of which had a positive impact on the Funds'
performances for this period. Zero coupon bonds, for example, typically have
very long durations and tend to be very sensitive to changes in interest rates.
With rates at the long end of the curve declining throughout much of this
12-month period, the zero coupon segment of the municipal market substantially
outperformed other similarly rated coupon bearing bonds.

Another factor in the annual performance of these Funds, especially relative to
that of the unleveraged Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index, was the
use of financial leverage. While leveraging can add volatility to a Fund's NAV
and share price, this strategy can also provide opportunities for additional
income and total return for common shareholders. Over this 12-month reporting
period, the Funds' performances were positively impacted by the leveraging
strategy, although not to the extent we have seen in past years. Over the long
term, we firmly believe that the use of financial leverage should continue to
work to the benefit of these Funds. This is demonstrated by the total return
performance of NQI, NIO, NIF, and NPX--both absolute and relative to the Lehman
Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index--over the 5-year and 10-year periods ended
October 31, 2006.

In addition, NEA, which can invest up to 20% of its portfolio in uninsured
investment-grade quality securities, benefited from allocations of lower-quality
credits during this period, as these bonds generally outperformed other credit
quality sectors. The performance of this sector was largely the result of
investor demand for the higher yields typically associated with lower-quality
bonds, which drove up their value and caused credit spreads (the difference in
interest rates of higher-quality and lower-quality bonds) to tighten. As of
October 31, 2006, NEA held 2% of its portfolio in bonds rated BBB and 3% in
bonds rated A. Among the lower-rated credits making contributions to NEA's total

8

return were several hospital holdings, as the health care sector ranked second
in terms of performance among the Lehman Brothers Insured Municipal Bond Index
revenue sectors for the period. NVG, which also can invest in uninsured
securities, did not hold any bonds rated below AA as of the end of this period.

We also continued to see positive contributions from advance refunding activity,
which benefited these Funds through price appreciation and enhanced credit
quality. While advance refundings generally enhanced performance for this
12-month period, the Funds' holdings of older, previously pre-refunded bonds
tended to underperform the general municipal market, due primarily to their
shorter effective maturities. During the first half of this period, NQI, NIF,
and NPX also experienced some calls affecting their holdings of higher-yielding
housing bonds, which impacted the income component of these Funds' total
returns.

HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
OCTOBER 31, 2006?

Maintaining strong credit quality remained an important requirement. As of
October 31, 2006, NQI, NIO, NIF, and NPX continued to be 100% invested in
insured and/or U.S. guaranteed securities, while NVG and NEA, which can invest
up to 20% of their portfolios in uninsured investment-grade quality securities,
had allocated 93% and 90% of their portfolios, respectively, to insured and U.S.
guaranteed bonds rated AAA.

At the end of October 2006, potential call exposure for the period November 2006
through the end of 2008 ranged from 2% in NIF, 4% in NEA, and 6% in NVG to 9% in
NQI, 10% in NPX, and 12% in NIO. The number of actual bond calls in all of these
Funds depends largely on future market interest rates.

                                                                               9

Dividend and Share Price
         INFORMATION

As previously noted, these six Funds use leverage to potentially enhance
opportunities for additional income for common shareholders. The benefits of
leveraging are tied in part to the short-term rates that leveraged Funds pay
their MuniPreferred(R) shareholders. During periods of low short-term rates,
these Funds generally pay lower dividends to their MuniPreferred shareholders,
which can leave more earnings to support common share dividends. Conversely,
when short-term interest rates rise, as they did during this reporting period,
the Funds' borrowing costs also rise, impacting their income streams and
reducing the extent of the benefits of leveraging. The Funds' income streams
were also impacted as the proceeds from older, higher-yielding bonds that
matured, were called or were sold were reinvested into bonds currently available
in the market, which generally offered lower yields. These factors resulted in
one monthly dividend reduction in NEA, two in NVG, three in NIO, NIF, and NPX,
and four in NQI over the 12-month period ended October 31, 2006.

Due to capital gains generated by normal portfolio activity such as the sale of
appreciated securities and bond calls, common shareholders of the following
Funds received capital gains and net ordinary income distributions at the end of
December 2005, as follows:

              LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS                           ORDINARY INCOME
                          (PER SHARE)                               (PER SHARE)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These distributions had a slight negative impact on the earning power per common
share of these three Funds and were a minor factor in the common share dividend
reductions noted above.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of

10

its net investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of October 31, 2006,
NQI, NIO, and NPX had positive UNII balances for both financial statement and
tax purposes, while NIF, NVG, and NEA had negative UNII balances for financial
statement purposes and positive UNII balances for tax purposes.

1     Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

                                                                              15

1     Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

1     Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment, in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

                                                                              17

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS/TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS
NUVEEN INSURED QUALITY MUNICIPAL FUND, INC.
NUVEEN INSURED MUNICIPAL OPPORTUNITY FUND, INC.
NUVEEN PREMIER INSURED MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND, INC.
NUVEEN INSURED PREMIUM INCOME MUNICIPAL FUND 2
NUVEEN INSURED DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND
NUVEEN INSURED TAX-FREE ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Premier Insured
Municipal Income Fund, Inc., Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2,
Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free
Advantage Municipal Fund (the "Funds") as of October 31, 2006, and the related
statements of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds' management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Insured Municipal
Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Premier Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Insured Premium Income Municipal Fund 2, Nuveen Insured Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund at
October 31, 2006, the results of their operations for the year then ended,
changes in their net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,
and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

        All of the bonds in the Portfolio of Investments, excluding temporary
        investments in short-term municipal securities, are either covered by
        Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio
        Insurance, or are backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient

        All of the bonds in the Portfolio of Investments, excluding temporary
        investments in short-term municipal securities, are either covered by
        Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio
        Insurance, or are backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient

        to Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities that are
        either covered by Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance
        or Portfolio Insurance which ensures the timely payment of principal and
        interest. Up to 20% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets
        attributable to Preferred shares) may be invested in municipal
        securities that are (i) either backed by an escrow or trust containing
        sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities (also
        ensuring the timely payment of principal and interest), or (ii) rated,
        at the time of investment, within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB or
        better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch) or unrated but judged to be of
        comparable quality by the Adviser.

</TABLE>

        At least 80% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets attributable
        to Preferred shares) are invested in municipal securities that are
        either covered by Original Issue Insurance, Secondary Market Insurance
        or Portfolio Insurance which ensures the timely payment of principal and
        interest. Up to 20% of the Fund's net assets (including net assets
        attributable to Preferred shares) may be invested in municipal
        securities that are (i) either backed by an escrow or trust containing
        sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities (also
        ensuring the timely payment of principal and interest), or (ii) rated,
        at the time of investment, within the four highest grades (Baa or BBB or
        better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch) or unrated but judged to be of
        comparable quality by the Adviser.

  (1)   All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are based on net
        assets applicable to Common shares unless otherwise noted.

  (2)   Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of independent
        registered public accounting firm): Dates (month and year) and prices of
        the earliest optional call or redemption. There may be other call
        provisions at varying prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed
        securities may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

  (3)   Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered public
        accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard & Poor's or Moody's
        rating. Ratings below BBB by Standard & Poor's Group or Baa by Moody's
        Investor Service, Inc. are considered to be below investment grade.

  (4)   Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or
        U.S. Government agency securities which ensure the timely payment of
        principal and interest. Such investments are normally considered to be
        equivalent to AAA rated securities.

(ETM)   Escrowed to maturity.

       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding Common
share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Insured Quality Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NQI), Nuveen Insured Municipal Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NIO), Nuveen Premier
Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (NIF), Nuveen Insured Premium Income
Municipal Fund 2 (NPX), Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NVG)
and Nuveen Insured Tax-Free Advantage Municipal Fund (NEA). Common shares of
Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange
while Common shares of Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free
Advantage (NEA) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end,
diversified management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income
tax, and in the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum
tax applicable to individuals, by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio
of municipal obligations issued by state and local government authorities or
certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

INVESTMENT VALUATION

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service establishes fair value based on
yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of forward swap contracts are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/ Trustees. If the
pricing service is unable to supply a price for a municipal bond or forward swap
contract, each Fund may use a market price or fair market value quote provided
by a major broker/dealer in such investments. If it is determined that the
market price or fair market value for an investment is unavailable or
inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee,
may establish a fair value for the investment. Temporary investments in
securities that have variable rate and demand features qualifying them as
short-term investments are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market
value.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis may have
extended settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2006, Insured
Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) and
Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) had outstanding when-issued/delayed delivery
purchase commitments of $6,434,647, $17,251,556, $11,061,616 and $4,087,131,
respectively. There were no such outstanding purchase commitments in either
Premier Insured Income (NIF) or Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) at October 31,
2006.

INVESTMENT INCOME

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all net investment income and net capital
gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, and in
the case of Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) the alternative minimum tax
applicable to individuals, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to
shareholders of the Funds. All monthly tax-exempt income dividends paid during
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, have been designated Exempt Interest
Dividends. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income distributions paid by
the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

<PAGE>


Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

PREFERRED SHARES

The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate paid by the Funds on each
Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process
overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end of each rate period.
The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each
Fund is as follows:

</TABLE>

INSURANCE

Insured Quality (NQI), Insured Opportunity (NIO), Premier Insured Income (NIF)
and Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) invest only in municipal securities which are
either covered by insurance or are backed by an escrow or trust account
containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both
of which ensure the timely payment of principal and interest.

Insured Dividend Advantage (NVG) and Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) invest at
least 80% of their net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred
shares) in municipal securities that are covered by insurance. Each Fund may
also invest up to 20% of its net assets (including net assets attributable to
Preferred shares) in municipal securities which are either (i) backed by an
escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S. Government or U.S. Government agency
securities, or (ii) rated, at the time of investment, within the four highest
grades (Baa or BBB or better by Moody's, S&P or Fitch) or unrated but judged to
be of comparable quality by the Adviser.

Each insured municipal security is covered by Original Issue Insurance,
Secondary Market Insurance or Portfolio Insurance. Such insurance does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' Common shares. Original Issue Insurance and Secondary Market Insurance
remain in effect as long as the municipal securities covered thereby remain
outstanding and the insurer remains in business, regardless of whether the Funds
ultimately dispose of such municipal securities. Consequently, the market value
of the municipal securities covered by Original Issue Insurance or Secondary
Market Insurance may reflect value attributable to the insurance. Portfolio
Insurance, in contrast, is effective only while the municipal securities are
held by the Funds. Accordingly, neither the prices used in determining the
market value of the underlying municipal securities nor the Common share net
asset value of the Funds include value, if any, attributable to the Portfolio
Insurance. Each policy of the Portfolio Insurance does, however, give the Funds
the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect to the municipal security
covered by the Portfolio Insurance policy at the time of its sale.

INVERSE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES

The Funds are authorized to invest in inverse floating rate securities. During
the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI), Insured
Opportunity (NIO), Insured Premium Income 2 (NPX) and Insured Dividend Advantage
(NVG) invested in inverse floating rate securities for the purpose of enhancing
portfolio yield. Inverse floating rate securities are identified in the
Portfolio of Investments and are valued daily. The interest rate of an inverse
floating rate security has an inverse relationship to the interest rate of a
short-term floating rate security. Consequently, as the interest rate of the
floating rate security rises, the interest rate on the inverse floating rate
security declines. Conversely, as the interest rate of the floating rate
security declines, the interest rate on the inverse floating rate security
rises. The price of an inverse floating rate security will be more volatile than
that of an otherwise comparable fixed rate security since the interest rate is
dependent on an underlying fixed coupon rate or the general level of long-term
interest rates as well as the short-term interest paid on the floating rate
security, and because the inverse floating rate security typically bears the
risk of loss of a greater face value of an underlying bond. There were no such
securities in either Premier Insured Income (NIF) or Insured Tax-Free Advantage
(NEA) during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006.

FORWARD SWAP TRANSACTIONS

The Funds are authorized to invest in certain derivative financial instruments.
The Funds' use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to help
the Fund manage its overall interest rate sensitivity, either shorter or longer,
generally to more closely align the Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that
of the broader municipal market. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve
each Fund's agreement with a counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or
variable rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a
variable or fixed rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a
specified date in the future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment
obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward swap contract and the
termination date of the swap (which is akin to a bond's maturity). The value of
the Fund's swap commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the
extent to which long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the
swap's termination date increases or decreases. The Funds may terminate a swap
contract prior to the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss is
recognized. When a forward

                                                                              75

<PAGE>


Notes to
       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not involve the delivery of securities or
other underlying assets or principal, but rather is settled in cash on a net
basis. Each Fund intends, but is not obligated, to terminate its forward swaps
before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the
swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to the credit risk associated
with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to
the Fund upon termination. To reduce such credit risk, all counterparties are
required to pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of each swap)
on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately equal to the amount of any
unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally, when any of the
Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Funds have instructed the
custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a value approximately
equal to the amount of the unrealized loss above a pre-determined threshold.
Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the swap
valuations fluctuate, either up or down, by at least the predetermined threshold
amount. At October 31, 2006, the Funds did not have any forward swap contracts
outstanding.

CUSTODIAN FEE CREDIT

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Directors/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

4. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to the treatment of paydown gains and losses, timing differences
in recognizing taxable market discount and timing differences in recognizing
certain gains and losses on investment transactions. To the extent that
differences arise that are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented
in the annual report, based on their Federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences
do not impact the net asset values of the Funds.

At October 31, 2006, the cost of investments was as follows:

5. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by Nuveen
Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen
Investments, Inc., ("Nuveen"), and a specific fund-level component, based only
on the amount of assets within each individual fund. This pricing structure
enables Nuveen fund shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within
each individual fund as well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets
managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares)
of each Fund as follows:

(1)   The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
      the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
      all types of leverage used by the Nuveen funds) of Nuveen-sponsored funds
      in the U.S.

(2)   With respect to the complex-wide Managed Assets over $91 billion, the fee
      rate or rates that will apply to such assets will be determined at a later
      date. In the unlikely event that complex-wide Managed Assets reach $91
      billion prior to a determination of the complex-level fee rate or rates to
      be applied to Managed Assets in excess of $91 billion, the complex-level
      fee rate for such complex-wide Managed Assets shall be .1400% until such
      time as a different rate or rates is determined.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Insured Dividend Advantage's (NVG) operations, the
Adviser has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net
assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares), for fees and
expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set forth below:

Notes to
       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The Adviser has not agreed to reimburse Insured Tax-Free Advantage (NEA) for any
portion of its fees and expenses beyond November 30, 2010.

As a result of certain trading errors that occurred during the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI) and Insured Opportunity (NIO) were
reimbursed $27,762 and $42,338, respectively, by the Adviser to offset losses
realized on the disposal of investments in violation of investment guidelines.

6. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD INTERPRETATION NO. 48

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48 ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES (FIN 48). FIN
48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied
to all open tax years as of the effective date. At this time, management is
evaluating the implications of FIN 48 and does not expect the adoption of FIN 48
will have a significant impact on the net assets or results of operations of the
Funds.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT ON FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
NO. 157

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement on Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements." This standard establishes a single authoritative definition of
fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires
additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to
fair value measurements already required or permitted by existing standards.
SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The changes to current generally accepted accounting principles from the
application of this standard relate to the definition of fair value, the methods
used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value
measurements. As of October 31, 2006, the Funds do not believe the adoption of
SFAS No. 157 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional
disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop the measurements
and the effect of certain of the measurements included within the Statement of
Operations for the period.

*     Total Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in the market
      price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. Total Return on Common Share Net
      Asset Value is the combination of changes in Common share net asset value,
      reinvested dividend income at net asset value and reinvested capital gains
      distributions at net asset value, if any. Total returns are not
      annualized.

**    After custodian fee credit and expense reimbursement, where applicable.

***   During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, Insured Quality (NQI) and
      Insured Opportunity (NIO) received payments from the Adviser of $27,762
      and $42,338, respectively, to offset losses realized on the disposal of
      investments purchased in violation of each Fund's investment restrictions.
      This reimbursement did not have an impact on the Funds' Total Return on
      Common Share Net Asset Value.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Preferred
      shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable
      to Preferred shares.

                  ANNUAL INVESTMENT
                  MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
                  APPROVAL PROCESS

The Board of Trustees is responsible for overseeing the performance of the
investment adviser to the Funds and determining whether to continue the advisory
arrangements. At a meeting held on May 23-25, 2006 (the "MAY MEETING"), the
Board of Trustees of the Funds, including the independent Trustees, unanimously
approved the continuance of the Investment Management Agreement between each
Fund and NAM (the "FUND ADVISER").

THE APPROVAL PROCESS

During the course of the year, the Board received a wide variety of materials
relating to the services provided by the Fund Adviser and the performance of
each Fund. To assist the Board in its evaluation of the advisory contract with
the Fund Adviser at the May Meeting, the independent Trustees received extensive
materials in advance of their meeting which outlined, among other things:

      o     the nature, extent and quality of services provided by the Fund
            Adviser;

      o     the organization and business operations of the Fund Adviser,
            including the responsibilities of various departments and key
            personnel;

      o     the Fund's past performance, the Fund's performance compared to
            funds of similar investment objectives compiled by an independent
            third party and to customized benchmarks;

      o     the profitability of the Fund Adviser and certain industry
            profitability analyses for unaffiliated advisers;

      o     the expenses of the Fund Adviser in providing the various services;

      o     the advisory fees (gross and net management fees) and total expense
            ratios of the Fund, including comparisons of such fees and expenses
            with those of comparable, unaffiliated funds based on information
            and data provided by Lipper (the "PEER UNIVERSE") as well as
            compared to a subset of funds within the Peer Universe (the "PEER
            GROUP") to the respective Fund (as applicable);

      o     the advisory fees the Fund Adviser assesses to other types of
            investment products or clients;

      o     the soft dollar practices of the Fund Adviser, if any; and

      o     from independent legal counsel, a legal memorandum describing, among
            other things, the duties of the Trustees under the Investment
            Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 ACT") as well as the general
            principles of relevant state law in reviewing and approving advisory
            contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; an
            adviser's fiduciary duty with respect to advisory agreements and
            compensation; the standards used by courts in determining whether
            investment company boards of directors have fulfilled their duties;
            and factors to be considered by the Board in voting on advisory
            agreements.

At the May Meeting, the Fund Adviser made a presentation to and responded to
questions from the Board. After the presentations and after reviewing the
written materials, the independent Trustees met privately with their legal
counsel to review the Board's duties in reviewing advisory contracts and
consider the renewal of the advisory contracts. It is with this background that
the Trustees considered the advisory contract with the Fund Adviser. The
independent Trustees, in consultation with independent counsel, reviewed the
factors set out in judicial decisions and SEC directives relating to the renewal
of advisory contracts. As outlined in more detail below, the Trustees considered
all factors they believed relevant with respect to each Fund, including the
following: (a) the nature, extent and quality of the services to be provided by
the Fund Adviser; (b) the investment performance of the Fund and the Fund
Adviser; (c) the costs of the services to be provided and profitability of the
Fund Adviser and its affiliates; (d) the extent to which economies of scale
would be realized as the Fund grows; and (e) whether fee levels reflect these
economies of scale for the benefit of Fund investors.

A. NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

In reviewing the Fund Adviser, the Trustees considered the nature, extent and
quality of the Fund Adviser's services. The Trustees reviewed materials
outlining, among other things, the Fund Adviser's organization and business; the
types of services that the Fund Adviser or its affiliates provide and are
expected to provide to the Funds; the performance record of the applicable Fund
(as described in further detail below); and any initiatives and enhancements
Nuveen has taken for its municipal fund product line. In connection with their
continued service as Trustees, the Trustees also have a good understanding of
the Fund Adviser's organization, operations and personnel. In this regard, the
Trustees are familiar with and have evaluated the professional experience,
qualifications and credentials of the Fund Adviser's personnel. The Trustees
further reviewed materials describing, among other things, the teams and

90

<PAGE>


personnel involved in the investment, research, risk-management and operational
processes involved in managing municipal funds and their respective functions.
Given the Trustees' experience with the Funds and Fund Adviser, the Trustees
recognized the demonstrated history of care and depth of experience of the
respective personnel in managing these Funds. In this regard, the Trustees
considered the continued quality of the Fund Adviser's investment process in
making portfolio management decisions as well as additional refinements and
improvements adopted to the portfolio management processes noted below. With
respect to the services provided to municipal funds, including the Funds, the
Trustees noted that the Fund Adviser continues to make refinements to its
portfolio management process including, among other things, the increased use of
derivatives to enhance management of risk, additional analytical software for
research staff and improved municipal pricing processes.

In addition to advisory services, the independent Trustees considered the
quality of any administrative or non-advisory services provided. The Fund
Adviser provides the Funds with such administrative and other services
(exclusive of, and in addition to, any such services provided by others for the
Funds) and officers and other personnel as are necessary for the operations of
the respective Fund. In connection with the review of the Investment Management
Agreement, the Trustees considered the extent and quality of these other
services which include, among other things, providing: product management (E.G.,
product positioning, performance benchmarking, risk management); fund
administration (E.G., daily net asset value pricing and reconciliation, tax
reporting, fulfilling regulatory filing requirements); oversight of third party
service providers; administration of board relations (E.G., organizing board
meetings and preparing related materials); compliance (E.G., monitoring
compliance with investment policies and guidelines and regulatory requirements);
and legal support (E.G., helping prepare and file registration statements,
amendments thereto, proxy statements and responding to regulatory requests
and/or inquiries). As the Funds operate in a highly regulated industry and given
the importance of compliance, the Trustees considered, in particular, the
additions of experienced personnel to the compliance teams and the enhancements
to technology and related systems to support the compliance activities for the
Funds (including a new reporting system for quarterly portfolio holdings).

In addition to the foregoing, the Trustees also noted the additional services
that the Fund Adviser or its affiliates provide to closed-end funds, including,
in particular, secondary market support activities. The Trustees recognized
Nuveen's continued commitment to supporting the secondary market for the common
shares of its closed-end funds through a variety of initiatives designed to
raise investor and analyst awareness and understanding of closed-end funds.
These efforts include providing advertising and other media relations programs,
continued contact with analysts, maintaining and enhancing its website for
closed-end funds, and targeted advisor communication programs. With respect to
funds that utilize leverage through the issuance of preferred shares, the
Trustees noted Nuveen's continued support for the preferred shares by
maintaining, among other things, an in-house preferred trading desk; designating
a product manager whose responsibilities include creating and disseminating
product information and managing relations in connection with the preferred
share auction; and maintaining systems necessary to test compliance with rating
agency requirements.

Based on their review, the Trustees found that, overall, the nature, extent and
quality of services provided (and expected to be provided) to the respective
Funds under the Investment Management Agreement were of a high level and were
satisfactory.

B. THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND AND FUND ADVISER

The Board considered the investment performance for each Fund, including the
Fund's historic performance as well as its performance compared to funds with
similar investment objectives identified by an independent third party (the
"PERFORMANCE PEER GROUP") and portfolio level performance against customized
benchmarks, as described below. In evaluating the performance information, in
certain instances, the Trustees noted that the closest Performance Peer Group
for a fund still may not adequately reflect such fund's investment objectives,
strategies and portfolio duration, thereby limiting the usefulness of the
comparisons of such fund's performance with that of the Performance Peer Group.
With respect to state specific municipal funds, the Trustees recognized that
certain state municipal funds do not have a corresponding state specific
Performance Peer Group in which case their performance is measured against a
more general municipal category for various states. The closed-end state
municipal funds that do not have corresponding state-specific Performance Peer
Groups are from Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, and Virginia. Further, due to a lack of
state-specific unleveraged categories, certain unleveraged state municipal funds
are included in their leveraged state category (such as, the Nuveen California
Select Tax-Free Income Fund, Nuveen California Municipal Value Fund, Nuveen New
York Select Tax-Free Income Fund and Nuveen New York Municipal Value Fund).

In reviewing performance, the Trustees reviewed performance information
including, among other things, total return information compared with the Fund's
Performance Peer Group for the one-, three- and five-year periods (as
applicable) ending December 31, 2005. The Trustees also reviewed the Fund's
portfolio level performance (which does not reflect fund level fees and
expenses) compared to customized portfolio-level benchmarks for the one- and
three-year periods ending December 31, 2005 (as applicable). This analysis is
designed to assess the efficacy of investment decisions against appropriate
measures of risk and total return, within specific market segments. This
information supplements the Fund performance information provided to the Board
at each of their quarterly meetings. Based on their review, the Trustees
determined that the respective Fund's absolute and relative investment
performance over time had been satisfactory.

C. FEES, EXPENSES AND PROFITABILITY

      1. FEES AND EXPENSES

      In evaluating the management fees and expenses of a Fund, the Board
      reviewed, among other things, the Fund's advisory fees (net and gross
      management fees) and total expense ratios (before and after expense
      reimbursements and/or waivers) in absolute terms as well as comparisons to
      the gross management fees (before waivers), net management fees (after
      waivers) and total expense ratios (before and after waivers) of comparable
      funds in the Peer Universe and the Peer Group. The Trustees reviewed data
      regarding the construction of Peer Groups as well as the methods of
      measurement for the fee and expense analysis and the performance analysis.
      In certain cases, due to the small number of peers in the Peer Universe,
      the Peer Universe and Peer Group

                                                                              91

<PAGE>


                  ANNUAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
                  AGREEMENT APPROVAL PROCESS (continued)

      may be the same. Further, the Trustees recognized that in certain cases
      the closest Peer Universe and/or Peer Group did not adequately reflect a
      fund's investment objectives and strategies limiting the usefulness of
      comparisons. In reviewing comparisons, the Trustees also considered the
      size of the Peer Universe and/or Peer Group, the composition of the Peer
      Group (including differences in the use of leverage and insurance) as well
      as differing levels of fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. In this
      regard, the Trustees considered the fund-level and complex-wide breakpoint
      schedules (described in further detail below) and any fee waivers and
      reimbursements provided by Nuveen (applicable, in particular, for certain
      funds launched since 1999). Based on their review of the fee and expense
      information provided, the Trustees determined that each Fund's net total
      expense ratio was within an acceptable range compared to peers.

      2. COMPARISONS WITH THE FEES OF OTHER CLIENTS

      The Trustees further reviewed data comparing the advisory fees of the Fund
      Adviser with fees the Fund Adviser charges to other clients, including
      municipal managed accounts. In general, the fees charged for separate
      accounts are somewhat lower than the fees assessed to the Funds. The
      Trustees recognized that the differences in fees are attributable to a
      variety of factors, including the differences in services provided,
      product distribution, portfolio investment policies, investor profiles,
      account sizes and regulatory requirements. The Trustees noted, in
      particular, that the range of services provided to the Funds is more
      extensive than that provided to managed separate accounts. As described in
      further detail above, such additional services include, but are not
      limited to, providing: product management, fund administration, oversight
      of third party service providers, administration of board relations, and
      legal support. Funds further operate in a highly regulated industry
      requiring extensive compliance functions compared to the other investment
      products. In addition to the costs of the additional services,
      administrative costs may also be greater for funds as the average account
      size for separate accounts is notably larger than the retail accounts of
      funds. Given the differences in the product structures, particularly the
      extensive services provided to closed-end municipal funds, the Trustees
      believe such facts justify the different levels of fees.

      3. PROFITABILITY OF FUND ADVISER

      In conjunction with its review of fees, the Trustees also considered the
      profitability of Nuveen Investments for advisory activities (which
      incorporated Nuveen's wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisers). The Trustees
      reviewed data comparing Nuveen's profitability with other fund sponsors
      prepared by three independent third party service providers as well as
      comparisons of the revenues, expenses and profits margins of various
      unaffiliated management firms with similar amounts of assets under
      management prepared by Nuveen. The Trustees further reviewed the 2005
      Annual Report for Nuveen Investments. In considering profitability, the
      Trustees recognized the inherent limitations in determining profitability
      as well as the difficulties in comparing the profitability of other
      unaffiliated advisers. Profitability may be affected by numerous factors,
      including the methodology for allocating expenses, the adviser's business
      mix, the types of funds managed, the adviser's capital structure and cost
      of capital. Further, individual fund or product line profitability of
      other sponsors is generally not publicly available. Accordingly, the
      profitability information that is publicly available from various
      investment advisory or management firms may not be representative of the
      industry.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in reviewing profitability, the Trustees reviewed
Nuveen's methodology and assumptions for allocating expenses across product
lines to determine profitability. In this regard, the methods of allocation used
appeared reasonable. The Trustees also, to the extent available, compared
Nuveen's profitability margins (including pre- and post-marketing profit
margins) with the profitability of various unaffiliated management firms. The
Trustees noted that Nuveen's profitability is enhanced due to its efficient
internal business model. The Trustees also recognized that while a number of
factors affect profitability, Nuveen's profitability may change as fee waivers
and/or expense reimbursement commitments of Nuveen to various funds in the
Nuveen complex expire. To keep apprised of profitability and developments that
may affect profitability, the Trustees have requested profitability analysis be
provided periodically during the year. Based on their review, the Trustees were
satisfied that the Fund Adviser's level of profitability was reasonable in light
of the services provided.

In evaluating the reasonableness of the compensation, the Trustees also
considered any other revenues paid to the Fund Adviser as well as any indirect
benefits (such as soft dollar arrangements, if any) the Fund Adviser and its
affiliates are expected to receive that are directly attributable to their
management of the Funds, if any. See Section E below for additional information.
Based on their review of the overall fee arrangements of the applicable Fund,
the Trustees determined that the advisory fees and expenses of the respective
Fund were reasonable.

D. ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT THESE ECONOMIES OF SCALE

With respect to economies of scale, the Trustees recognized the potential
benefits resulting from the costs of a fund being spread over a larger asset
base as a fund grows. To help ensure the shareholders share in these benefits,
the Trustees have reviewed and considered the breakpoints in the advisory fee
schedules that reduce advisory fees as the applicable Fund's assets grow. In
addition to advisory fee breakpoints as assets in a respective Fund rise, after
lengthy discussions with management, the Board also approved a complex-wide fee
arrangement that was introduced on August 1, 2004. Pursuant to the complex-wide
fee arrangement, the fees of the funds in the Nuveen complex, including the
Funds, are reduced as the assets in the fund complex reach certain levels. In
evaluating the complex-wide fee arrangement, the Trustees considered, among
other things, the historic and expected fee savings to shareholders as assets
grow, the amount of fee reductions at various asset levels, and that the
arrangement would extend to all funds in the Nuveen complex. The Trustees noted
that 2005 was the first full year to reflect the fee reductions from the complex
wide fee arrangement. The Trustees also considered the impact, if any, the
complex-wide fee arrangement may have on the level of services provided. Based
on their review, the Trustees concluded that the breakpoint schedule and
complex-wide fee arrangement currently was acceptable and desirable in providing
benefits from economies of scale to shareholders.

E. INDIRECT BENEFITS

In evaluating fees, the Trustees also considered any indirect benefits or
profits the Fund Adviser or its affiliates may receive as a result of its
relationship with each Fund. In this regard, the Trustees considered revenues
received by affiliates of the Fund Adviser for serving as agent at Nuveen's
preferred trading desk and for serving as a co-manager in the initial public
offering of new closed-end exchange traded funds.

In addition to the above, the Trustees considered whether the Fund Adviser
received any benefits from soft dollar arrangements. With respect to NAM, the
Trustees noted that NAM does not currently have any soft dollar arrangements and
does not pay excess brokerage commissions (or spreads on principal transactions)
in order to receive research services; however, the Fund Adviser may from time
to time receive and have access to research generally provided to institutional
clients.

F. APPROVAL

The Trustees did not identify any single factor discussed previously as
all-important or controlling. The Trustees, including a majority of independent
Trustees, concluded that the terms of the Investment Management Agreements were
fair and reasonable, that the Fund Adviser's fees are reasonable in light of the
services provided to each Fund, and that the renewal of the Investment
Management Agreements should be approved.

                                                                              93

Reinvest Automatically
      EASILY AND CONVENIENTLY

Sidebar text: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END FUNDS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive
a statement showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of
investment, the shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of
shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
the shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase
price per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting
in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable
brokerage commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan
participants. These commissions usually will be lower than those charged on
individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Automatic Dividend
      REINVESTMENT PLAN

NOTICE OF AMENDMENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS

These Funds are amending the terms and conditions of their Automatic Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") as further described below effective with the
close of business on February 1st, 2007. THESE CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO ENABLE
PLAN PARTICIPANTS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO REINVEST FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AT
A LOWER AGGREGATE COST THAN IS POSSIBLE UNDER THE EXISTING PLAN. Shareholders
who do not wish to continue as participants under the amended Plan may withdraw
from the Plan by notifying the Plan Agent prior to the effective date of the
amendments. Participants should refer to their Plan document for notification
instructions, or may simply call Nuveen at (800) 257-8787.

Fund shareholders who elect to participate in the Plan are able to have Fund
distributions consisting of income dividends, realized capital gains and returns
of capital automatically reinvested in additional Fund shares. Under the Plan's
existing terms, the Plan Agent purchases Fund shares in the open market if the
Fund's shares are trading at a discount to their net asset value on the payable
date for the distribution. If the Fund's shares are trading at or above their
net asset value on the payable date for the distribution, the Plan Agent
purchases newly-issued Fund shares directly from the Fund at a price equal to
the greater of the shares' net asset value or 95% of the shares' market value.

Under the Plan's amended terms, if the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares
on the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the
Fund's shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the
Plan Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease
open-market purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution
in newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value. This change will permit Plan
participants under these circumstances to reinvest Fund distributions at a lower
aggregate cost than is possible under the existing Plan.

                                                                              95

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal the
investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or market
price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if any) over the
time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

MODIFIED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period over which a
bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently is a measure of the
sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes when market interest
rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's duration, the more the
price of the bond or Fund will change as interest rates change.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated by
subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred shares
issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing
the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the registrant has adopted a
code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or
persons performing similar functions. There were no amendments to or waivers
from the Code during the period covered by this report. The registrant has
posted the code of ethics on its website at www.nuveen.com/etf. (To view the
code, click on the Investor Resources drop down menu box, click on Fund
Governance and then click on Code of Conduct.)

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees determined that the registrant
has at least one "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 3 of
Form N-CSR) serving on its Audit Committee. The registrant's audit committee
financial expert is Jack B. Evans, Chairman of the Audit Committee, who is
"independent" for purposes of Item 3 of Form N-CSR.

Mr. Evans was formerly President and Chief Operating Officer of SCI Financial
Group, Inc., a full service registered broker-dealer and registered investment
adviser ("SCI"). As part of his role as President and Chief Operating Officer,
Mr. Evans actively supervised the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO") and
actively supervised the CFO's preparation of financial statements and other
filings with various regulatory authorities. In such capacity, Mr. Evans was
actively involved in the preparation of SCI's financial statements and the
resolution of issues raised in connection therewith. Mr. Evans has also served
on the audit committee of various reporting companies. At such companies, Mr.
Evans was involved in the oversight of audits, audit plans, and the preparation
of financial statements. Mr. Evans also formerly chaired the audit committee of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

                Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund

The following tables show the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP, the Fund's
auditor, billed to the Fund during the Fund's last two full fiscal years. For
engagements with Ernst & Young LLP the Audit Committee approved in advance all
audit services and non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP provided to the
Fund, except for those non-audit services that were subject to the pre-approval
exception under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (the "pre-approval exception"). The
pre-approval exception for services provided directly to the Fund waives the
pre-approval requirement for services other than audit, review or attest
services if: (A) the aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes
no more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its
accountant during the fiscal year in which the services are provided; (B) the
Fund did not recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the
engagement; and (C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's
attention, and the Committee (or its delegate) approves the services before the
audit is completed.

The Audit Committee has delegated certain pre-approval responsibilities to its
Chairman (or, in his absence, any other member of the Audit Committee).

engagements directly related to the Fund's operations and financial reporting,
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years.

The tables also show the percentage of fees subject to the pre-approval
exception. The pre-approval exception for services provided to the Adviser and
any Affiliated Fund Service Provider (other than audit, review or attest
services) waives the pre-approval requirement if: (A) the aggregate amount of
all such services provided constitutes no more than 5% of the total amount of
revenues paid to Ernst & Young LLP by the Fund, the Adviser and Affiliated Fund
Service Providers during the fiscal year in which the services are provided that

recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the engagement; and
(C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's attention, and

(1)  The amounts reported for the Fund under the column heading "Tax Fees"
     represents amounts billed to the Adviser exclusively for the preparation

     the aggregate, for all Nuveen funds for which Ernst & Young LLP serves as
     independent registered public accounting firm, these fees amounted to
     $275,000 in 2006 and $282,575 in 2005.


                               NON-AUDIT SERVICES

The following table shows the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP billed
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years for non-audit services. The Audit
Committee is required to pre-approve non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP
provides to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Services Provider, if the
engagement related directly to the Fund's operations and financial reporting
(except for those subject to the de minimis exception described above). The
Audit Committee requested and received information from Ernst & Young LLP about
any non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP rendered during the Fund's last
fiscal year to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Service Provider. The
Committee considered this information in evaluating Ernst & Young LLP's
independence.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, the Audit
Committee must approve (i) all non-audit services to be performed for the Fund
by the Fund's independent accountants and (ii) all audit and non-audit services
to be performed by the Fund's independent accountants for the Affiliated Fund
Service Providers with respect to operations and financial reporting of the
Fund. Regarding tax and research projects conducted by the independent
accountants for the Fund and Affiliated Fund Service Providers (with respect to
operations and financial reports of the Fund) such engagements will be (i)
pre-approved by the Audit Committee if they are expected to be for amounts
greater than $10,000; (ii) reported to the Audit Committee chairman for his
verbal approval prior to engagement if they are expected to be for amounts under
$10,000 but greater than $5,000; and (iii) reported to the Audit Committee at
the next Audit Committee meeting if they are expected to be for an amount under
$5,000.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees has a separately designated
Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)). The
members of the audit committee are Robert P. Bremner, Lawrence H. Brown, Jack B.
Evans, William J. Schneider and Eugene S. Sunshine.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

See Portfolio of Investments in Item 1.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant invests its assets primarily in municipal bonds and cash
management securities. On rare occasions the registrant may acquire, directly or
through a special purpose vehicle, equity securities of a municipal bond issuer
whose bonds the registrant already owns when such bonds have deteriorated or are
expected shortly to deteriorate significantly in credit quality. The purpose of
acquiring equity securities generally will be to acquire control of the
municipal bond issuer and to seek to prevent the credit deterioration or
facilitate the liquidation or other workout of the distressed issuer's credit
problem. In the course of exercising control of a distressed municipal issuer,
NAM may pursue the registrant's interests in a variety of ways, which may entail
negotiating and executing consents, agreements and other arrangements, and
otherwise influencing the management of the issuer. NAM does not consider such
activities proxy voting for purposes of Rule 206(4)-6 under the 1940 Act, but
nevertheless provides reports to the registrant's Board of Trustees on its
control activities on a quarterly basis.

In the rare event that a municipal issuer were to issue a proxy or that the
registrant were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security, NAM
would either engage an independent third party to determine how the proxy should
be voted or vote the proxy with the consent, or based on the instructions, of
the registrant's Board of Trustees or its representative. A member of NAM's
legal department would oversee the administration of the voting, and ensure that
records were maintained in accordance with Rule 206(4)-6, reports were filed
with the SEC on Form N-PX, and the results provided to the registrant's Board of
Trustees and made available to shareholders as required by applicable rules.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER

The following individual has primary responsibility for the day-to-day
implementation of the registrant's investment strategies:

NAME               FUND
Paul Brennan       Nuveen Insured Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund

Other Accounts Managed. In addition to managing the registrant, the portfolio
manager is also primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management of
the following accounts:

                                                      NUMBER OF
PORTFOLIO MANAGER  TYPE OF ACCOUNT MANAGED            ACCOUNTS   ASSETS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Brennan       Registered Investment Company      14         $11.890 billion
                   Other Pooled Investment Vehicles    0         $0.00
                   Other Accounts                      1         $.6 million

*    Assets are as of October 31, 2006. None of the assets in these accounts are
     subject to an advisory fee based on performance.

Compensation. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of three basic
elements--base salary, cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation. The
compensation strategy is to annually compare overall compensation, including
these three elements, to the market in order to create a compensation structure
that is competitive and consistent with similar financial services companies. As
discussed below, several factors are considered in determining each portfolio
manager's total compensation. In any year these factors may include, among
others, the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended by the
portfolio manager's investment team, the investment performance of the accounts
managed by the portfolio manager, and the overall performance of Nuveen
Investments, Inc. (the parent company of NAM). Although investment performance
is a factor in determining the portfolio manager's compensation, it is not
necessarily a decisive factor. The portfolio manager's performance is evaluated
in part by comparing manager's performance against a specified investment
benchmark. This fund-specific benchmark is a customized subset (limited to bonds
in each Fund's specific state and with certain maturity parameters) of the
S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index, an index comprised of bonds held by
managed municipal bond fund customers of Standard & Poor's Securities Pricing,
Inc. that are priced daily and whose fund holdings aggregate at least $2
million. As of October 31, 2006, the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index was
comprised of 48,513 securities with an aggregate current market value of $
923,532 billion.

Base salary. Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary that is set at a level
determined by NAM in accordance with its overall compensation strategy discussed
above. NAM is not under any current contractual obligation to increase a
portfolio manager's base salary.

Cash bonus. Each portfolio manager is also eligible to receive an annual cash
bonus. The level of this bonus is based upon evaluations and determinations made
by each portfolio manager's supervisors, along with reviews submitted by his
peers. These reviews and evaluations often take into account a number of
factors, including the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended to
the NAM's investment team, the performance of the accounts for which he serves
as portfolio manager relative to any benchmarks established for those accounts,
his effectiveness in communicating investment performance to stockholders and
their representatives, and his contribution to the NAM's investment process and
to the execution of investment strategies. The cash bonus component is also
impacted by the overall performance of Nuveen Investments, Inc. in achieving its
business objectives.

Long-term incentive compensation. Each portfolio manager is eligible to receive
bonus compensation in the form of equity-based awards issued in securities
issued by Nuveen Investments, Inc. The amount of such compensation is dependent
upon the same factors articulated for cash bonus awards but also factors in his
long-term potential with the firm.

Material Conflicts of Interest. Each portfolio manager's simultaneous management
of the registrant and the other accounts noted above may present actual or
apparent conflicts of interest with respect to the allocation and aggregation of
securities orders placed on behalf of the Registrant and the other account. NAM,
however, believes that such potential conflicts are mitigated by the fact that
the NAM has adopted several policies that address potential conflicts of
interest, including best execution and trade allocation policies that are
designed to ensure (1) that portfolio management is seeking the best price for
portfolio securities under the circumstances, (2) fair and equitable allocation
of investment opportunities among accounts over time and (3) compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements. All accounts are to be treated in a
non-preferential manner, such that allocations are not based upon account
performance, fee structure or preference of the portfolio manager. In addition,
NAM has adopted a Code of Conduct that sets forth policies regarding conflicts
of interest.

Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of the October 31, 2006, the portfolio
manager beneficially owned the following dollar range of equity securities
issued by the Registrant and other Nuveen Funds managed by NAM's municipal
investment team.

     (a)  designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such

          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

     (b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

     (c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

          evaluation; and

     (d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

     5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
