                               SHAREHOLDER LETTER
                                  MAY 31, 2005

To My Fellow Shareholders in the Clough Global Allocation Fund:

The Fund began investing on July 29, 2004 and is about to complete its first
year of existence. We are pleased with its performance to date. Its closing
market price on May 31, 2005 was $22.59 per share, 12.95% above its $20.00
initial offering price. In addition, three cash distributions totaling $0.93 per
share have been paid, so the Fund's total return to shareholders based on market
price has been 18.24%. Meanwhile the Fund's underlying net asset value has
increased 8.74%, from $19.10 to $20.77 per share on May 31st. The Fund's market
price has consistently been at a premium to net asset value.

The Fund is first of all an asset allocation fund and we aggressively manage the
mix between our bond and stock holdings. In recent months a number of our equity
themes provided stocks at attractive prices so the Fund is currently
over-weighted in stocks. As of May 31, 2005 the fund had 70% of it total
investments invested in stocks and 27% in bonds. On the equity side, the Fund is
invested in what we believe to be the five or six most attractive investment
themes in the global financial markets. The remainder of this letter explains
our current themes.

Our largest exposure is in global energy, with primary focus on North American
gas exploration and production companies and companies which provide rigs and
services for deep-water drilling. Investors and policymakers are coming to
realize that the major oil and gas fields that provided the world's energy over
the past 50 years are obsolete or depleting, and the investment necessary to
replace those reserves has not been made. At current oil and gas prices, our
producing companies are rapidly building cash, in many instances to levels that
will exceed the firm's entire equity value in a few short years. High energy
prices will be with us for years into the future because entirely new oil and
gas fields must be developed to augment supplies, yet most of these fields lie
beneath 5,000 feet of water. The industry has been slow to build new rigs and
accelerate drilling activity. This reluctance to invest in new equipment has
substantially increased the value of existing rigs and our investments in
deep-water drillers.

The Fund has a global mandate and holds substantial investments in Japan.
Japanese stocks are still down 70% from their highs of over sixteen years ago,
yet both Japanese banks and companies have restructured and corporate
profitability has improved markedly. Several of the Japanese stocks owned in the
Fund are selling for little more than their cash holdings. Japan's economy has
been recovering since 2002, largely due to exports, but today employment and
incomes are improving, unemployment is declining and the strength of domestic
demand is becoming more pronounced. Domestic capital spending, largely by
smaller and mid-sized companies, has been rising at better than a 20% annual
rate, and we think Japan could become the world's fastest growing developed
economy. Our holdings are centered in companies that benefit from domestic
demand such as banks, real estate firms and retailers.

We have also invested in emerging Asian countries, largely through exchange
traded funds. China remains the world's premier growth story which is having an
effect throughout Asia. Asian markets tend to act as leading indicators of
global growth and some are moving higher once again. The Fund's holdings provide
exposure in Hong Kong, which is China's primary financial center, Taiwan and
Malaysia.

                                        1
<Page>

Much of the Fund's remaining equity exposure is to a number of industries whose
stocks offer both low price/earnings ratios and high cash flows. Two industries
which offer both are the utilities and the global property/casualty insurance
companies. We recently added to the Fund's utility holdings for several reasons.
Some companies with attractive nuclear assets are offering dividend yields in
excess of 4%, roughly in line with the yield on the ten year Treasury, and we
believe those dividends will grow in coming years. More importantly, a recent
PriceWaterhouseCoopers study estimated that $12.7 trillion will be invested in
the global electric power infrastructure over the next 25 years to meet an
expected doubling in electricity consumption. Much of the nation's transmission
grid is aging and needs replacement and blackouts will become more frequent. A
potential catalyst for attracting investment in the electric infrastructure is a
repeal of the Public Utilities Holding Company Act. Even Warren Buffet has
publicly announced he would invest $10-15 billion in electric utilities if the
act were repealed. Others have noted there are ten times more utility companies
than needed and the industry is highly fractionalized. The average utility stock
trades at slightly less than 8 times free cash flow (equivalent to a 13% free
cash flow return), and a 3.6% dividend yield. A wave of consolidation would
follow the Act's repeal, similar to the one which increased the value of banking
franchises in the 1990s.

We have also increased our holdings among global property/casualty insurers, one
of the only industries to our knowledge whose stocks sell at 7 times earnings.
We still think investors are too bearish about the downside of the underwriting
cycle, that AIG's difficulties indicate managements can no longer cover up poor
underwriting results with unauthorized accounting techniques and aggressive
investing strategies. As such, we believe that underwriting cycles will
moderate, and that cash flows will continue to build.

Long-term government yields have declined to new lows for the cycle in the face
of near universal belief that they were headed higher, and that could help
stabilize global economies. Many commentators insist on identifying growth with
inflation and convinced themselves price inflation was something the markets had
to deal with. We think otherwise. Outside of energy and a few selected
commodities, there is plenty of productive capacity and in most manufacturing
and consumer goods sectors, even outside of autos, capacity continues to rise.
Inflation measures are declining everywhere, even in China. We think the major
surprise will be how low inflation will be as the year unfolds. We believe
rising bond prices in the face of falling currencies in Europe are clearly
pointing to deflation. The danger, of course, is that if deflation returns to
certain sectors and companies lose pricing power, stock prices will weaken in
those sectors.

Our Fund strives to find the winners and losers in such a world. If investment
is excessive in most industries, we will endeavor to find the sectors where that
is not the case, because capital will be available to them at a very low cost.
That is the essence of the opportunities we see in the energy and emerging
market sectors. If companies have to be more careful with their capital and can
no longer invest for low returns, we will find those companies where cash is
building and where cash returns are high and ignored in the marketplace. That is
the essence of our investments in Japan and global insurance.

We were pleased to increase the Fund's quarterly cash distribution from $0.30 to
$0.33 in the most recent quarter and we will aim over time to increase the
payout to our shareholders in line with the increase in the Fund's net asset
value. We thank you for investing in the Clough Global Allocation Fund and
invite you to read the updates on our investment thinking on the Fund's website,
www.cloughglobal.com.


Sincerely,

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of
Clough Global Allocation Fund

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of the
Clough Global Allocation Fund (the "Fund"), including the statement of
investments, as of May 31, 2005, and the related statement of operations and
statement of changes in net assets for the period from July 28, 2004
(commencement of operations) to May 31, 2005, and the financial highlights for
the period presented. These financial statements and financial highlights are
the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers; where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Clough Global Allocation Fund as of May 31, 2005, the results of its operations
and changes in its net assets for the period from July 28, 2004 (commencement of
operations) to May 31, 2005, and the financial highlights for the period
presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

                                  MAY 31, 2005

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND OPERATING POLICIES
Clough Global Allocation Fund is a closed-end management investment company (the
"Fund") that was organized under the laws of the state of Delaware by an
Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated April 27, 2004. The Fund is a
non-diversified series with an investment objective to provide a high level of
total return. The Declaration of Trust provides that the Trustees may authorize
separate classes of shares of beneficial interest.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value per Share of the Fund is determined no
less frequently than daily, on each day that the American Stock Exchange (the
"Exchange") is open for trading, as of the close of regular trading on the
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. New York time). Trading may take place in foreign
issues held by the Fund at times when the Fund is not open for business. As a
result, the Fund's net asset value may change at times when it is not possible
to purchase or sell shares of the Fund. Securities held by the fund for which
exchange quotations are readily available are valued at the last sale price, or
if no sale price or if traded on the over-the-counter market, at the mean of the
bid and asked prices on such day. Over-the-counter securities traded on NASDAQ
are valued based upon the closing price. Debt securities for which the
over-the-counter market is the primary market are normally valued on the basis
of prices furnished by one or pricing services at the mean between the latest
available bid and asked prices. As authorized by the Trustees, debt securities
(other than short-term obligations) may be valued on the basis of valuations
furnished by a pricing service which determines valuations based upon market
transactions for normal, institutional-size trading units of securities.
Short-term obligations maturing within 60 days are valued at amortized cost,
which approximates value, unless the Trustees determine that under particular
circumstances such method does not result in fair value. Over-the-counter
options are valued at the mean between bid and asked prices provided by dealers.
Financial futures contracts listed on commodity exchanges and exchange-traded
options are valued at closing settlement prices. Securities for which there is
no such quotation or valuation and all other assets are valued at fair value in
good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

FOREIGN SECURITIES: The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in foreign
securities. In the event that the Fund executes a foreign security transaction,
the Fund will generally enter into a forward foreign currency contract to settle
the foreign security transaction. Foreign securities may carry more risk than
U.S. securities, such as political, market and currency risks.

The accounting records of the Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars. Prices of
securities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at
the closing rates of exchange at period end. Amounts related to the purchase and
sale of foreign securities and investment income are translated at the rates of
exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.

The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments is
included with the fluctuations arising from changes in market values of
securities held and reported with all other foreign currency gains and losses in
the Fund's Statement of Operations.

OPTIONS: The Fund may purchase or write (sell) put and call options. One of the
risks associated with purchasing an option among others, is that the Fund pays a
premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the Fund bears the
risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the counterparty not
perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are accounted for in
the same manner as portfolio securities. The cost of securities acquired through
the exercise of call options is

                                       16
<Page>

increased by premiums paid. The proceeds from securities sold through the
exercise of put options are decreased by the premiums paid.

When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the
Fund is recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current
value of the option written. Premiums received from writing options that expire
unexercised are treated by the Fund on the expiration date as realized gains
from investments. The difference between the premium and the amount paid on
effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is
also treated as a realized gain, or, if the premium is less than the amount paid
for the closing purchase transaction, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security or currency in determining whether the Fund has realized a gain or
loss. If a put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the
securities purchased by the Fund. The Fund, as writer of an option, bears the
market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the
written option. Written and purchased options are non- income producing
securities.

Written option activity as of May 31, 2005 was as follows:

</Table>

SHORT SALES: The Fund may sell a security it does not own in anticipation of a
decline in the fair value of that security. When the Fund sells a security
short, it must borrow the security sold short and deliver it to the
broker-dealer through which it made the short sale. A gain, limited to the price
at which the Fund sold the security short, or a loss, unlimited in size, will be
recognized upon the termination of the short sale.

INCOME TAXES: The Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all
of its taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund intends to make a level dividend
distribution each quarter to Common Shareholders after payment of interest on
any outstanding borrowings or dividends on any outstanding preferred shares. The
level dividend rate may be modified by the Board of Trustees from time to time.
Any net capital gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually to
the extent necessary to avoid federal income and excise taxes. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. The Fund has
applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an exemption from Section
19(b) of the 1940 Act and Rule 19b-1 thereunder permitting the Fund to make
periodic distributions of long-term capital gains, provided that the
distribution policy of the Fund with respect to its Common Shares calls for
periodic (e.g., quarterly/monthly) distributions in an amount equal to a fixed
percentage of the Fund's average net asset value over a specified period of time
or market price per common share at or about the time of distribution or pay-out
of a level dollar amount.

                                       17

SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment security transactions
are accounted for as of trade date. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income, which includes amortization of premium and
accretion of discount, is accrued as earned. Realized gains and losses from
securities transactions and unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
securities are determined using the highest cost basis for both financial
reporting and income tax purposes.

USE OF ESTIMATES: The Fund's financial statements are prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
This requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.  CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS
COMMON SHARES: There are an unlimited number of no par value common shares of
beneficial interest authorized. Of the 9,877,834 common shares outstanding on
May 31, 2005, ALPS Mutual Funds Services, Inc. owned 5,236 shares. The Fund
issued 8,750,000 common shares in its initial public offering on July 28, 2004.
These common shares were issued at $20.00 per share before the underwriting
discount of $0.90 per share. An additional 650,000 common shares and 270,000
common shares were issued on August 27,

                                       18
<Page>

2004 and September 15, 2004, respectively. These common shares were also issued
at $20.00 per share before the underwriting discount of $0.90 per share.
Offering costs of $386,800 (representing $.04 per common share) were offset
against proceeds of the offering and have been charged to paid-in capital of the
common shares. ALPS agreed to pay those offering costs of the Fund (other than
sales load, but inclusive of the reimbursement of the underwriter expenses of
$.0067 per common share) that exceed $.04 per common share.

Net investment income (loss) and net realized gain (loss) may differ from
financial statement and tax purposes. These differences are primarily due to the
treatment of certain investment securities and distribution allocations. These
permanent differences in the character of income and distributions between
financial statements and tax basis have been reclassified. During the year ended
May 31, 2005, $8,393,035 was reclassified from accumulated capital gains to
undistributed ordinary income. Net assets of the Fund were unaffected by the
reclassifications and the calculation of net investment income per share in the
Financial Highlights excludes these adjustments.

Transactions in common shares for the year ended May 31, 2005, were as follows:

PREFERRED SHARES: On September 15, 2004, the Fund's Board of Trustees authorized
the issuance of an unlimited number of no par value preferred shares, in
addition to the existing common shares, as part of the Fund's leverage strategy.
Preferred shares issued by the Fund have seniority over the common shares.
Offering costs associated with the issuance of preferred shares, estimated at
$300,000, and the underwriters' sales load totaling $950,000, have been borne by
the common shareolders as a direct reduction to paid in capital.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations and restrictions while preferred
shares are outstanding. Failure to comply with these limitations and
restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any dividends or
distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of Preferred Shares at their liquidation value.
Specifically, the Fund is required under the Investment Company Act of 1940 to
maintain an asset coverage with respect to the outstanding preferred shares of
200% or greater.

The Fund has one series of Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMPS"), W28. On
December 1, 2004, the Fund issued 3,800 shares of AMPS with a net asset and
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accrued dividends. Dividends on the
AMPS are cumulative and are paid based on an annual rate set through auction
procedures. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid
annually. As of May 31, 2005, the annualized dividend rate for the AMPS was
3.14%. The dividend rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected
to vary with short-term interest rates. The rate may vary in a manner unrelated
to the income received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
Common Shareholders.

                                       19

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with
the Common Shares but vote separately as a class to elect two Trustees and on
any matters affecting the rights of the Preferred Shares.

4.  PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term securities,
for the period ended May 31, 2005 aggregated $735,335,133 and $474,960,275,
respectively. Purchase and sales of U.S. government and agency securities, other
than short-term securities, for the period ended May 31, 2005 aggregated
$243,416,105 and $162,787,168, respectively.

5.  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENTS
Clough Capital Partners L.P. ("Clough") serves as the Fund's investment adviser
pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Fund. As compensation for
its services to the Fund, Clough receives an annual investment advisory fee of
0.70% based on the Fund's average daily total assets, computed daily and payable
monthly.

ALPS Mutual Funds Services, Inc. ("ALPS") serves as the Fund's administrator
pursuant to an Administration, Bookkeeping and Pricing Services Agreement with
the Fund. As compensation for its services to the Fund, ALPS receives an annual
administration fee of 0.285% based on the Fund's average daily total assets,
computed daily and payable monthly. ALPS will pay all expenses incurred by the
Fund, with the exception of advisory fees, trustees' fees, portfolio transaction
expenses, litigation expenses, taxes, cost of preferred shares, expenses of
conducting repurchase offers for the purpose of repurchasing fund shares, and
extraordinary expenses.

6. LINE OF CREDIT
On October 27, 2004, a Security Agreement between the Fund and The Bank of New
York ("BONY") was executed which allows the Fund to borrow against a secured
line of credit from BONY an aggregate amount of up to $87,500,000. The
borrowings under the BONY line of credit are secured by pledging the Fund's
portfolio securities as collateral. During the period ended May 31, 2005, the
average borrowing was $1,436,957 with an average rate on borrowings of 3.24%.

7.  OTHER
The Independent Trustees of the Fund receive a quarterly retainer of $3,500 and
an additional $1,500 for each meeting attended.

Unless the registered owner of Common Shares elects to receive cash by
contacting The Bank of New York (the "Plan Administrator" or "BONY"), all
dividends declared on Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by the Plan
Administrator for shareholders in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
"Plan"), in additional Common Shares. Shareholders who elect not to participate
in the Plan will receive all dividends and other distributions in cash paid by
check mailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the Common Shares are
held in street or other nominee name, then to such nominee) by BONY as dividend
disbursing agent. You may elect not to participate in the Plan and to receive
all dividends in cash by contacting BONY, as dividend disbursing

                            MAY 31, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

agent, at the address set forth below. Participation in the Plan is completely
voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by notice
if received and processed by the Plan Administrator prior to the dividend record
date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with respect to
any subsequently declared dividend or other distribution. Some brokers may
automatically elect to receive cash on your behalf and may re-invest that cash
in additional Common Shares for you. If you wish for all dividends declared on
your Common Shares to be automatically reinvested pursuant to the Plan, please
contact your broker.

 The Plan Administrator will open an account for each Common Shareholder under
the Plan in the same name in which such Common Shareholder's Common Shares are
registered. Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or other distribution
(together, a "Dividend") payable in cash, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in Common
Shares. The Common Shares will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for the
participants' accounts, depending upon the circumstances described below, either
(i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized Common Shares from the
Fund ("Newly Issued Common Shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding Common
Shares on the open market ("Open-Market Purchases") on the American Stock
Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the closing
market price plus estimated brokerage commissions per Common Share is equal to
or greater than the net asset value per Common Share, the Plan Administrator
will invest the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares on behalf of the
participants. The number of Newly Issued Common Shares to be credited to each
participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
Dividend by the net asset value per Common Share on the payment date; provided
that, if the net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the closing market
value on the payment date, the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by
95% of the closing market price per Common Share on the payment date. If, on the
payment date for any Dividend, the net asset value per Common Share is greater
than the closing market value plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Administrator will invest the Dividend amount in Common Shares acquired on
behalf of the participants in Open-Market Purchases. In the event of a market
discount on the payment date for any Dividend, the Plan Administrator will have
until the last business day before the next date on which the Common Shares
trade on an "ex-dividend" basis or 30 days after the payment date for such
Dividend, whichever is sooner (the "Last Purchase Date"), to invest the Dividend
amount in Common Shares acquired in Open-Market Purchases. If, before the Plan
Administrator has completed its Open-Market Purchases, the market price per
Common Share exceeds the net asset value per Common Share, the average per
Common Share purchase price paid by the Plan Administrator may exceed the net
asset value of the Common Shares, resulting in the acquisition of fewer Common
Shares than if the Dividend had been paid in Newly Issued Common Shares on the
Dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty with respect to
Open-Market Purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan Administrator is
unable to invest the full Dividend amount in Open-Market Purchases during the
purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a market premium during the
purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease making Open-Market Purchases
and may invest the uninvested portion of the Dividend amount in Newly Issued
Common Shares at the net asset value per Common Share at the close of business
on the Last

                                       21
<Page>

Purchase Date provided that, if the net asset value is less than or equal to 95%
of the then current market price per Common Share; the dollar amount of the
Dividend will be divided by 95% of the market price on the payment date.

The Plan Administrator maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including
information needed by shareholders for tax records. Common Shares in the account
of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator on behalf of the
Plan participant, and each shareholder proxy will include those shares purchased
or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Administrator will forward all proxy
solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held under
the Plan in accordance with the instructions of the participants. In the case of
Common Shareholders such as banks, brokers or nominees which hold shares for
others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan Administrator will administer the

(1)  Advisory fee based in part on performance of accounts.

(2)  Material Conflicts:

Material conflicts of interest may arise as a result of the fact that the
Portfolio Managers also have day-to-day management responsibilities with respect
to both the Fund and the various accounts listed above (collectively with the
Fund, the "Accounts"). These potential conflicts include:

         LIMITED RESOURCES. The Portfolio Managers cannot devote their full time
and attention to the management of each of the Accounts. Accordingly, the
Portfolio Managers may be limited in their ability to identify investment
opportunities for each of the Accounts that are as attractive as might be the
case if the Portfolio Managers were to devote substantially more attention to
the management of a single Account. The effects of this potential conflict may
be more pronounced where the Accounts have different investment strategies.

         LIMITED INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES. If the Portfolio Managers identify a
limited investment opportunity that may be appropriate for more than one
Account, the investment opportunity may be allocated among several Accounts.
This could limit any single Account's ability to take full advantage of an
investment opportunity that might not be limited if the Portfolio Managers did
not provide investment advice to other Accounts.

         DIFFERENT INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. The Accounts managed by the Portfolio
Managers have differing investment strategies. If the Portfolio Managers
determine that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only some of the
Accounts or decide that certain of the Accounts should take different positions
with respect to a particular security, the Portfolio Managers may effect
transactions for one or more Accounts which may affect the market price of the
security or the execution of the transaction, or both, to the detriment or
benefit of one or more other Accounts.

         VARIATION IN COMPENSATION. A conflict of interest may arise where
Clough or Clough Associates, LLC, as applicable, is compensated differently by
the Accounts that are managed by the Portfolio Managers. If certain Accounts pay
higher management fees or performance-based incentive fees, the Portfolio
Managers might be motivated to prefer certain Accounts over others. The
Portfolio Managers might also be motivated to favor Accounts in which they have
a greater ownership interest or Accounts that are more likely to enhance the
Portfolio Managers' performance record or to otherwise benefit the Portfolio
Managers.

         SELECTION OF BROKERS. The Portfolio Managers select the brokers that
execute securities transactions for the Accounts that they supervise. In
addition to executing trades, some brokers provide the Portfolio Managers with
research and other services which may require the payment of higher brokerage
fees than might otherwise be available. The Portfolio Managers' decision as to
the selection of brokers could yield disproportionate costs and benefits among
the Accounts that they manage, since the research and other services provided by
brokers may be more beneficial to some Accounts than to others.

(a)(3) Portfolio Manager Compensation as of May 31, 2005.

The Portfolio Managers each receive a fixed base salary from Clough. The base
salary for each Portfolio Manager is typically determined based on market
factors and the skill and experience of each Portfolio Manager. Additionally,
Clough distributes its annual net profits to the three Portfolio Managers, with
Mr. Clough receiving a majority share and the remainder being divided evenly
between Mr. Brock and Mr. Canty.

                                   security holder
                              -    Whether fund cast its vote on the matter
                              -    How the fund cast its vote
                                   (for/against/abstain)

<Page>

                              -    Whether fund cast its vote for or against the
                                   management position on the issue

                          This information is required to be filed with the SEC
                          electronically via Form N-PX for all registered
                          investment companies (mutual funds) no later than
                          August 31 for the most recent 12 month period ended
                          June 30. This will be done by the fund's
                          administrator, ALPS Mutual Fund Services, for the
                          mutual fund sponsored by Clough Capital, but ALPS will
                          need this information from Clough. The information
                          also needs to be sent to ALPS for posting to the
                          fund's website for access by shareholders.

                          4.0  CONTRADICTION TO PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

                          For the proxy issues outlined in the attached Proxy
                          Voting Guidelines, the Clough Capital voting position
                          will generally be as listed, unless an analyst,
                          trader, or partner of the firm believes that voting a
                          particular proxy in accordance with the stated
                          guideline would not be in the best economic interests
                          of a client account, in which case that person should
                          bring the matter to the attention of the Operations
                          Administrator. The Administrator will then refer the
                          matter to the Compliance Committee for resolution.
                          Votes in contradiction to the established Proxy Voting
                          Guidelines will be documented in an appropriate memo
                          to file.

                          4.1  VOTES ON ISSUES NOT LISTED IN THE PROXY VOTING
                          GUIDELINES

                          If a proxy vote is received and the Operations
                          Administrator cannot find the particular issue to be
                          voted on the Proxy Voting Guidelines, then the
                          Administrator must summarize the issue and then bring
                          it to the attention of the analyst covering that
                          industry and the relevant portfolio manager for
                          consideration. Once there has been determination made
                          as to how to vote the issue, the analyst should update
                          the Proxy Voting Guidelines for guidance on future,
                          similar issues.

                          5.0  RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS

                          Clough Capital must keep accurate books and records,
                          including those relating to proxy voting. The records
                          that must be maintained in accordance with the Record

                          site and 4 years offsite.

                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

For the following proxy issues, the Clough Capital voting position will
generally be as listed, unless an analyst, trader, or partner of the firm
believes that voting a particular proxy in accordance with the stated guideline
would not be in the best economic interests of a client account, in which case
that person should bring the matter to the attention of the Operations
Administrator. The Administrator will then refer the matter to the Compliance
Committee for resolution as outlined in the Proxy Voting Procedures.

                          CLOUGH GLOBAL ALLOCATION FUND

          CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.       PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         The Clough Global Allocation Fund (the "Fund") code of ethics (this
"Code") is intended to serve as the code of ethics described in Section 406 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Item 2 of Form N-CSR. This Code shall be the
sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes of Section 406 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable to registered investment
companies thereunder. Insofar as other policies or procedures of the Fund, the
Fund's adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers govern or
purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers, as defined
herein, who are subject to this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the
extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. The
Fund's and its investment adviser's, and principal underwriter's codes of ethics
pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")
are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of this Code.

         All Covered Officers must become familiar and fully comply with this
Code. Because this Code cannot and does not cover every applicable law or
provide answers to all questions that might arise, all Covered Officers are
expected to use common sense about what is right and wrong, including a sense of
when it is proper to seek guidance from others on the appropriate course of
conduct.

         The purpose of this Code is to set standards for the Covered Officers
that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote:

         -     honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
               actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
               professional relationships;

         -     full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in
               reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to,
               the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and in any
               other public communications by the Fund;

         -     compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and
               regulations;

         -     the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to the
               appropriate persons as set forth in the Code; and

         -     accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.      COVERED PERSONS

                                        3
<Page>

         This Code applies to the Fund's Principal Executive Officers and
Principal Financial Officers, or any persons performing similar functions on
behalf of the Fund (the "Covered Officers"). Each Covered Person should adhere
to a high standard of business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that
may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Covered
Officers are expected to act in accordance with the standards set forth in this
Code.

2.       HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT

         A.    HONESTY, DILIGENCE AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY

         Covered Officers are expected to observe both the form and the spirit
of the ethical principles contained in this Code. Covered Officers must perform
their duties and responsibilities for the Fund:

         -     with honesty, diligence, and a commitment to professional and
               ethical responsibility;

         -     carefully, thoroughly and in a timely manner; and

         -     in conformity with applicable professional and technical
               standards.

         Covered Officers who are certified public accountants are expected to
carry out their duties and responsibilities in a manner consistent with the
principles governing the accounting profession, including any guidelines or
principles issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants from time to time.

         B.    OBJECTIVITY/AVOIDANCE OF UNDISCLOSED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         Covered Officers are expected to maintain objectivity and avoid
undisclosed conflicts of interest. In the performance of their duties and
responsibilities for the Fund, Covered Officers must not subordinate their
judgment to personal gain and advantage, or be unduly influenced by their own
interests or by the interests of others. Covered Officers must avoid
participation in any activity or relationship that constitutes a conflict of
interest unless that conflict has been completely disclosed to affected parties
and waived by the Trustees on behalf of the Fund. Further, Covered Officers
should avoid participation in any activity or relationship that could create the
appearance of a conflict of interest.

         A conflict of interest would generally arise if, for instance, a
Covered Officer directly or indirectly participates in any investment, interest,
association, activity or relationship that may impair or appear to impair the
Covered Officer's objectivity or interfere with the interests of, or the Covered
Officer's service to, the Fund.

         Any Covered Officer who may be involved in a situation or activity that
might be a conflict of interest or give the appearance of a conflict of interest
must report such situation or activity using the reporting procedures set forth
in Section VI of this Code.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

                                        4
<Page>

- -        use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly
         to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
         whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
         of the Fund;

- -        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take actions, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit of the Fund; or

- -        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
         contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
         personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

         Each Covered Officer is responsible for his or her compliance with this
conflict of interest policy.

         C.    PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

         Covered Officers must not knowingly make any misrepresentations
regarding the Fund's financial statements or any facts in the preparation of the
Fund's financial statements, and must comply with all applicable laws,
standards, principles, guidelines, rules and regulations in the preparation of
the Fund's financial statements. This section is intended to prohibit:

         -     making, or permitting or directing another to make, materially
               false or misleading entries in the Fund's financial statements or
               records;

         -     failing to correct the Fund's financial statements or records
               that are materially false or misleading when he or she has the
               authority to record an entry; and

         -     signing, or permitting or directing another to sign, a document
               containing materially false or misleading financial information.

         Covered Officers must be scrupulous in their application of generally
accepted accounting principles. No Covered Officer may (i) express an opinion or
state affirmatively that the financial statements or other financial data of the
Fund are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
or (ii) state that he or she is not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to such statements or data in order for them to be in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles, if such statements or data
contain any departure from generally accepted accounting principles then in
effect in the United States.

         Covered Officers must follow the laws, standards, principles,
guidelines, rules and regulations established by all applicable governmental
bodies, commissions or other regulatory agencies in the preparation of financial
statements, records and related information. If a Covered Officer prepares
financial statements, records or related information for purposes of reporting
to such bodies, commissions or regulatory agencies, the Covered Officer must
follow the requirements of such organizations in addition to generally accepted
accounting principles.

         If a Covered Officer and his or her supervisor have a disagreement or
dispute relating to the preparation of financial statements or the recording of
transactions, the Covered Officer should take the following steps to ensure that
the situation does not constitute an impermissible subordination of judgment:

                                        5
<Page>

         -     The Covered Officer should consider whether (i) the entry or the
               failure to record a transaction in the records, or (ii) the
               financial statement presentation or the nature or omission of
               disclosure in the financial statements, as proposed by the
               supervisor, represents the use of an acceptable alternative and
               does not materially misrepresent the facts or result in an
               omission of a material fact. If, after appropriate research or
               consultation, the Covered Officer concludes that the matter has
               authoritative support and/or does not result in a material
               misrepresentation, the Covered Officer need do nothing further.

         -     If the Covered Officer concludes that the financial statements or
               records could be materially misstated as a result of the
               supervisor's determination, the Covered Officer should follow the
               reporting procedures set forth in Section VI of this Code.

         D.    OBLIGATIONS TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR OF THE FUND

         In dealing with the Fund's independent auditor, Covered Officers must
be candid and not knowingly misrepresent facts or knowingly fail to disclose
material facts, and must respond to specific inquiries and requests by the
Fund's independent auditor.

         Covered Officers must not take any action, or direct any person to take
any action, to fraudulently influence, coerce, manipulate or mislead the Fund's
independent auditor in the performance of an audit of the Fund's financial
statements for the purpose of rendering such financial statements materially
misleading.

3.       FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY AND UNDERSTANDABLE DISCLOSURE

         It is the Fund's policy to provide full, fair, accurate, timely, and
understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Fund files with, or
submits to, the SEC and in any other public communications by the Fund. The Fund
has designed and implemented Disclosure Controls and Procedures to carry out
this policy.

         Covered Officers are expected to familiarize themselves with the
disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund, and to use their best
efforts to promote, facilitate, and prepare full, fair, accurate, timely, and
understandable disclosure in all reports and documents that the Fund files with,
or submits to, the SEC and in any other public communications by the Fund.

         Covered Officers must review the Fund's Disclosure Controls and
Procedures to ensure they are aware of and carry out their duties and
responsibilities in accordance with the Disclosure Controls and Procedures and
the disclosure obligations of the Fund. Covered Officers are responsible for
monitoring the integrity and effectiveness of the Fund's Disclosure Controls and
Procedures.

4.       COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

         Covered Officers are expected to know, respect and comply with all
laws, rules and regulations applicable to the conduct of the Fund's business. If
a Covered Officer is in doubt about the legality or propriety of an action,
business practice or policy, the Covered Officer should seek advice from the
Covered Officer's supervisor or the Fund's legal counsel.

                                        6
<Page>

         In the performance of their work, Covered Officers must not knowingly
be a party to any illegal activity or engage in acts that are discreditable to
the Fund.

         Covered Officers are expected to promote the Fund's compliance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations. To promote such compliance, Covered
Officers may establish and maintain mechanisms to educate employees carrying out
the finance and compliance functions of the Fund about any applicable laws,
rules or regulations that affect the operation of the finance and compliance
functions and the Fund generally.

5.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         All Covered Officers will be held accountable for adherence to this
Code. Each Covered Officer must, upon the Fund's adoption of this Code (or
thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to
the Board that he/she has received, read, and understands this Code by signing
the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Appendix A. Thereafter, each Covered
Officer, on an annual basis, must affirm to the Board that he/she has complied
with the requirements of this Code.

         Covered Officers may not retaliate against any other Covered Officer of
the Fund or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
are made in good faith.

         The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         A.    Any Covered Officer who knows of any violation of this Code or
               who questions whether a situation, activity or practice is
               acceptable must immediately report such practice to the Fund's
               Audit Committee. The Audit Committee shall take appropriate
               action to investigate any reported potential violations. If,
               after such investigation, the Audit Committee believes that no
               violation has occurred, the Audit Committee is not required to
               take any further action. Any matter that the Audit Committee
               believes is a violation will be reported to the Chairman of the
               Board of Trustees. The Audit Committee shall respond to the
               Covered Officer within a reasonable period of time.

         B.    If the Covered Officer is not satisfied with the response of the
               Audit Committee, the Covered Officer shall report the matter to
               the Chairman of the Board of Trustees. If the Chairman is
               unavailable, the Covered Officer may report the matter to any
               other member of the Board of Trustees. The person receiving the
               report shall consider the matter, refer it to the full Board of
               Trustees if he or she deems appropriate, and respond to the
               Covered Officer within a reasonable amount of time. If the Board
               of Trustees concurs that a violation has occurred, it will
               consider appropriate action, which may include review of and
               appropriate modifications to applicable policies and procedures
               or notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
               adviser or its board.

         C.    If the Board of Trustees determines that a Covered Officer
               violated this Code, failed to report a known or suspected
               violation of this Code, or provided intentionally false or
               malicious information in connection with an alleged violation of
               this Code, the Board of Trustees may take disciplinary action
               against any such Covered Officer to the extent the Board of
               Trustees deems appropriate. No Covered Officer will be
               disciplined for reporting a concern in good faith.

                                        7
<Page>

         To the extent possible and as allowed by law, reports will be treated
as confidential. The Fund may report violations of the law to the appropriate
authorities.

6.       DISCLOSURE OF THIS CODE

         This Code shall be disclosed to the public by at least one of the
following methods in the manner prescribed by the SEC, unless otherwise required
by law:

         -     Filing a copy of this Code as an exhibit to the Fund's annual
               report on Form N-CSR;

         -     Posting the text of this Code on the Fund's Internet website and
               disclosing, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet
               address and the fact that it has posted this Code on its Internet
               website; or

         -     Providing an undertaking in the Fund's most recent report on Form
               N-CSR to provide a copy of this Code to any person without charge
               upon request, and explaining the manner in which such a request
               may be made.

7.       WAIVERS

         Any waiver of this Code, including an implicit waiver, granted to a
Covered Officer may be made only by the Board of Trustees or a committee of the
Board to which such responsibility has been delegated, and must be disclosed by
the Fund in the manner prescribed by law and as set forth above in Section VII

I, Edmund J. Burke, President and Principal Executive Officer of the Clough
Global Allocation Fund, certify that:

 1.  I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of the Clough Global Allocation
     Fund;

 2.  Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

 3.  Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
     information included in this report, fairly present in all material
     respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in net
     assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required to include
     a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
     presented in this report;

 4.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) and internal
     control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940) for the Registrant and have:

      a.  Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
          disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
          supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

      b.  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

      c.  Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

      d.  Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably

                                       10
<Page>

          likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
          financial reporting; and

 5.  The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions);

      a.  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      b.  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
