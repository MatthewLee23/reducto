NOT FDIC INSURED
MAY LOSE VALUE
NO BANK GUARANTEE


BlackRock Enhanced Capital and Income Fund, Inc. seeks to provide shareholders
with current income and capital appreciation. The Fund seeks to achieve its
investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of equity and debt
securities of U.S. and foreign issuers.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to
shareholders of BlackRock Enhanced Capital and Income Fund, Inc. for their
information. It is not a prospectus. The Fund leverages its Common Stock to
provide Common Stock shareholders with a potentially higher rate of return.
Leverage creates risk for Common Stock shareholders, including the likelihood
of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of Common Stock
shares, and the risk that fluctuations in short-term interest rates may reduce
the Common Stock's yield. Past performance results shown in this report should
not be considered a representation of future performance. Statements and other
information herein are as dated and are subject to change.

A description of the policies and procedures that the Fund uses to determine
how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available (1)
without charge, upon request, by calling toll-free 1-800-441-7762; (2) at
www.blackrock.com; and (3) on the Securities and Exchange Commission's Web
site at http://www.sec.gov. Information about how the Fund voted proxies
relating to securities held in the Fund's portfolio during the most recent
12-month period ended June 30 is available (1) at www.blackrock.com and (2) on

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging


BlackRock Capital and Income Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leveraging through
borrowings or issuance of short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred
Stock. The concept of leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of
assets to be obtained from leverage will be based on short-term interest or
dividend rates, which normally will be lower than the income earned by the
Fund on its longer-term portfolio investments. To the extent that the total
assets of the Fund (including the assets obtained from leverage) are invested
in higher-yielding portfolio investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders
are the beneficiaries of the incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend
rates on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue the Preferred Stock)
may reduce the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value
and market price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets
received from leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income
will be greater than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income
from the securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage,
the Fund's net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and
therefore the amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders
will be reduced.

A Letter to Shareholders


Dear Shareholder

At the mid-point of 2007, investor sentiment appeared quite buoyant,
notwithstanding some undertones of caution. For equity markets, positive
momentum as the year began was interrupted by a notable but transitory
set-back at the end of February. Markets resumed their ascent through May,
but entered a trading range in June as investors began to question the
sustainability of the rally. For the most part, equities found support in
robust merger-and-acquisition activity, healthy global economies, tame
inflation, relatively low interest rates, still-positive earnings growth and
attractive valuations. These tailwinds prevailed over such headwinds as a
weakening U.S. economy, slowing housing market, credit-related lending
problems, escalating geopolitical concerns and high energy prices, leading
the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index to a new record high in May.

Meanwhile, turmoil in the subprime mortgage market and generally mixed
economic signals weighed on bonds. In June, bond prices dropped precipitously
as long-term yields rose to their highest levels in five years. The 10-year
Treasury yield, which began 2007 at 4.68%, reached nearly 5.30% in mid-June
before retracing to 5.03% by month's end. Notably, this year has brought some
re-steepening of the yield curve, which had been flat to inverted throughout
2006. Still, at the end of June, yields along the curve remained below the
federal funds rate of 5.25%, the level at which the Federal Reserve Board (the
Fed) has left it since first pausing in August 2006. While first-quarter gross
domestic product growth of 0.7% represented the slowest rate of expansion
since 2002, the Fed reiterated that inflation, not a slowing economy, remains
its primary concern. Many observers interpreted the Fed's reaction to mean
that the economy has hit its low and is bound for renewed strength, thereby
reducing the likelihood of an interest rate cut in the near future.

Against this backdrop, the major equity market indexes posted strong returns
for the annual and semi-annual periods ended June 30, 2007, while fixed income
assets were more mixed:

you navigate the uncertainties, we encourage you to review your investment
goals with your financial professional and to make portfolio changes, as
needed. For more market insight, we invite you to view "What's Ahead in 2007:

BLACKROCK ENHANCED CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND, INC.                  JUNE 30, 2007



Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)


1. Significant Accounting Policies:
BlackRock Enhanced Capital and Income Fund, Inc. (formerly BlackRock Capital
and Income Strategies Fund, Inc.), (the "Fund") is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end
management investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may
require the use of management accruals and estimates. Actual results may
differ from these estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all
adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a
fair statement of the results for the interim period. All such adjustments are
of a normal, recurring nature. The Fund determines and makes available for
publication the net asset value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The
Fund's Common Stock shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
under the symbol CII. The following is a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Fund.

(a) Valuation of investments--Debt securities are traded primarily in the
over-the-counter ("OTC") markets and are valued at the last available bid price
in the OTC markets or on the basis of values as obtained by a pricing service.
Pricing services use valuation matrixes that incorporate both dealer-supplied
valuations and valuation models. The procedures of the pricing service and its
valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the general
direction of the Board of Directors. Such valuations and procedures will be
reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Financial futures
contracts and options thereon, which are traded on exchanges, are valued at
their closing prices as of the close of such exchanges. Options written or
purchased are valued at the last sale price in the case of exchange-traded
options. Options traded in the OTC market are valued at the last asked price
(options written) or the last bid price (options purchased). Swap agreements
are valued based upon quoted fair valuations received daily by the Fund from a
pricing service or counterparty. Repurchase agreements are valued at cost plus
accrued interest. The Fund employs pricing services to provide certain
securities prices for the Fund. Securities and assets for which market
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in
good faith by or under the direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund,
including valuations furnished by the pricing services retained by the Fund,
which may utilize a matrix system for valuations.

Equity securities held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the
NASDAQ Global Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price
on the exchange, as of the close of business on the day the securities are
being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last available bid price for long
positions, and at the last available asked price for short positions. In cases
where equity securities are traded on more than one exchange, the securities
are valued on the exchange designated as the primary market by or under the
authority of the Board of Directors of the Fund. Long positions traded in the
OTC markets, NASDAQ Capital Market or Bulletin Board are valued at the last
available bid price or yield equivalent obtained from one or more dealers or
pricing services approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund. Short
positions traded in the OTC markets are valued at the last available asked
price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in the OTC markets and on a
stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. government
securities, money market instruments and certain fixed income securities, is
substantially completed each day at various times prior to the close of
business on the NYSE. The values of such securities used in computing the net
asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of such times. Foreign
currency exchange rates will generally be determined as of the close of
business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the values of such
securities and such exchange rates may occur between the times at which they
are determined and the close of business on the NYSE that may not be reflected
in the computation of the Fund's net asset value. If events (for example, a
company announcement, market volatility or a natural disaster) occur during
such periods that are expected to materially affect the value of such
securities, those securities will be valued at their fair value as determined
in good faith by the Fund's Board of Directors or by BlackRock Advisors, LLC
(the "Manager"), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc.,
using a pricing service and/or procedures approved by the Fund's Board of
Directors.

(b) Derivative financial instruments--The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the
securities markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the
contract resulting from an unfavorable price change in the underlying security
or index, or if the counterparty does not perform under the contract. The
counterparty for certain instruments may pledge cash or securities as
collateral.



BLACKROCK ENHANCED CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND, INC.                  JUNE 30, 2007



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


* Options--The Fund may write and purchase call and put options. When the Fund
writes an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Fund is
reflected as an asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability
is subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the
option written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted from)
the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to) the proceeds
of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund enters into a
closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on the option to the
extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the extent the
cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid or received).

Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

* Financial futures contracts--The Fund may purchase or sell financial futures
contracts and options on such financial futures contracts. Financial futures
contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific
future date and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract,
the Fund deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required
by the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount of
cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such receipts or
payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the Fund as
unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was closed.

* Swaps--The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are OTC contracts in
which the Fund and a counterparty agree to make periodic net payments on a
specified notional amount. The net payments can be made for a set period of
time or may be triggered by a predetermined credit event. The net periodic
payments may be based on a fixed or variable interest rate; the change in
market value of a specified security, basket of securities, or index; or the
return generated by a security. These periodic payments received or made by
the Fund are recorded in the accompanying Statement of Operations as realized
gains or losses, respectively. Gains or losses are realized upon termination
of the swap agreements. Swaps are marked-to-market and changes in value are
recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Risks include changes in
the returns of the underlying instruments, failure of the counterparties to
perform under the contracts' terms and the possible lack of liquidity with
respect to the swap agreements.

(c) Income taxes--It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

(d) Security transactions and investment income--Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the trans-actions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.
Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(e) Dividends and distributions--Dividends are declared and paid quarterly.
Distribution of capital gains are recorded on the ex-dividend dates. If the
total dividends and distributions made in any tax year exceeds net investment
income and accumulated realized capital gains, a portion of the total
distribution may be treated as a tax return of capital.



BLACKROCK ENHANCED CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND, INC.                  JUNE 30, 2007



Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


(f) Securities lending--The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at
least 100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market
value of the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the
Fund and any additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the
next business day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the
loaned securities, it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically
receives the income on the loaned securities but does not receive the income
on the collateral. Where the Fund receives cash collateral it may invest such
collateral and retain the amount earned on such investment, net of any amount
rebated to the borrower. Loans of securities are terminable at any time and
the borrower, after notice, is required to return the borrowed securities
within five business days. The Fund may pay reasonable finder's, lending
agent, administrative and custodial fees in connection with its loans. In the
event that the borrower defaults on its obligation to return borrowed
securities because of insolvency or for any other reason, the Fund could
experience delays and costs in gaining access to the collateral. The Fund also
could suffer a loss where the value of the collateral falls below the market
value of the borrowed securities, in the event of borrower default or in the
event of losses on investments made with cash collateral.

(g) Bank overdraft--The Fund recorded a bank overdraft which resulted from
management estimates of available cash.

(h) Recent accounting pronouncements--Effective June 29, 2007, the Fund
implemented Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation
No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of
FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 prescribes the minimum recognition
threshold a tax position must meet in connection with accounting for
uncertainties in income tax positions taken or expected to be taken by an
entity, including investment companies, before being measured and recognized
in the financial statements. Management has evaluated the application of FIN
48 to the Fund, and has determined that the adoption of FIN 48 does not have
a material impact on the Fund's financial statements. The Fund files U.S. and
various state tax returns. No income tax returns are currently under
examination. The statute of limitations on the Fund's tax returns remains
open for the years ended December 31, 2003 through December 31, 2006.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair
Value Measurements" ("FAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. At this time, management is evaluating the implications of FAS
157 and its impact on the Fund's financial statements, if any, has not been
determined.

In addition, in February 2007, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities"
("FAS 159"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal
year that begins on or before November 15, 2007, provided the entity also
elects to apply the provisions of FAS 157. FAS 159 permits entities to choose
to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value
that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. FAS 159 also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate
comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for
similar types of assets and liabilities. At this time, management is
evaluating the implications of FAS 159 and its impact on the Fund's financial
statements, if any, has not been determined.


2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:
The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with the Manager.
Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("Merrill Lynch") and The PNC Financial Services
Group, Inc. are the principal owners of BlackRock, Inc.

The Manager is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and
provides the necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other
services necessary to the operations of the Fund. For such services, the Fund
pays a monthly fee at an annual rate of .85% of the Fund's average daily net
assets, including the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for
leverage. In addition, the Manager has entered into sub-advisory agreements
with BlackRock Investment Management, LLC ("BIM") and BlackRock Financial
Management, Inc., both affiliates of the Manager, under which the Manager pays
BIM for services it provides a fee that is a percentage of the management fee
paid by the Fund to the Manager.



BLACKROCK ENHANCED CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND, INC.                  JUNE 30, 2007



Notes to Financial Statements (concluded)


The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S"), a wholly owned subsidiary
of Merrill Lynch, or its affiliates. Pursuant to that order, the Fund has
retained BIM as the securities lending agent for a fee based on a share of
the returns on investment of cash collateral. BIM may, on behalf of the Fund,
invest cash, collateral received by the Fund for such loans, among other
things, in a private investment company managed by the Manager or in
registered money market funds advised by the Manager or its affiliates.

In addition, MLPF&S received $12,942 in commissions on the execution of
portfolio security transactions for the Fund for the six months ended
June 30, 2007.

For the six months ended June 30, 2007, the Fund reimbursed the Manager
$2,383 for certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors
of BlackRock, Inc. or its affiliates.


3. Investments:
Purchases and sales (including paydowns) of investments, excluding short-term
securities, for the six months ended June 30, 2007 were $102,572,348 and

4. Capital Share Transactions:
The Fund is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of capital stock, par value
$.10 per share, all of which were initially classified as Common Stock. The
Board of Directors is authorized, however, to reclassify any unissued shares
of stock without approval of holders of Common Stock.


Common Stock

Shares issued and outstanding during the six months ended June 30, 2007
remained constant and for the year ended December 31, 2006 decreased by
641,500 as a result of a share repurchase offer.


5. Short-Term Borrowings:
On May 18, 2007, the Fund renewed its revolving credit and security agreement
funded by a commercial paper asset securitization program with Citicorp North
America, Inc. ("Citicorp") as Agent, certain secondary backstop lenders, and
certain asset securitization conduits as lenders (the "Lenders"). The
agreement was renewed for one year and has a maximum limit of $135,000,000.
Under the Citicorp program, the conduits will fund advances to the Fund
through the issuance of highly rated commercial paper. As security for its
obligations to the Lenders under the revolving securitization facility, the
Fund has granted a security interest in substantially all of its assets to and
in favor of the Lenders. The interest rate on the Fund's borrowings is based
on the interest rate carried by the commercial paper plus a program fee. The
Fund pays additional borrowing costs including asset securitization fees and a
backstop commitment fee.

For the six months ended June 30, 2007, the average amount borrowed was
approximately $78,220,000 and the daily weighted average interest rate was
5.61%.



BLACKROCK ENHANCED CAPITAL AND INCOME FUND, INC.                  JUNE 30, 2007



Managed Distribution Policy


The Fund has adopted a policy of paying regular distributions on its Common
Stock (the "Managed Distribution Policy"). The Fund's Board of Directors has
initially determined to pay quarterly distributions at an annualized rate of
6% of the initial public offering price per share ($.30 per share, per
quarter). The Fund's Board of Directors has determined to pay additional
distributions on an annual basis equal to any income earned by the Fund in
excess of the quarterly distributions as may be necessary to distribute
substantially all of the Fund's net investment company taxable income for that
year.

The Fund generally is not permitted to distribute net realized long-term
capital gains more than once per year without exemptive relief from the
Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, the Fund has applied for an
exemptive order that will permit the Fund to make periodic distributions of
realized long-term capital gains to its shareholders. Until such time, if any,
as the exemptive relief is granted, the Fund intends to make distributions
from its net investment income on a quarterly basis and from its net realized
long-term capital gains, if any, on an annual basis. If such exemptive relief
is granted, the Fund intends to make distributions from its net investment
income and its realized long-term capital gains, if any, on a quarterly basis.

If the total distributions paid by the Fund to its shareholders for any
calendar year exceed the Fund's net investment company taxable income and net
realized capital gain for that year, the excess will generally be treated as a
tax-free return of capital up to the amount of a shareholder's tax basis in
his or her stock. Any distributions that constitute tax-free return of capital
will reduce a shareholder's tax basis in his or her stock. In effect, a return
of capital is the return of a shareholder's investment in the Fund and will
result in a corresponding decline in the Fund's net asset value. Return of
capital distributions also may have the effect of increasing the Fund's
operating expense ratio. Any amounts distributed to a shareholder in excess of
such shareholder's tax basis in his or her stock will generally be taxable to
the shareholder as capital gain.

The Fund currently expects that the amount of distributions made under the
Managed Distribution Policy generally will be independent of, and not
contingent upon, the Fund's performance in any of the first three quarters of
the Fund's fiscal year. Distribution rates under the Managed Distribution
Policy may be increased in the Fund's fourth fiscal quarter in light of the
Fund's performance for the fiscal year and to enable the Fund to comply with
the distribution requirements applicable to regulated investment companies.
It also is currently expected that the Fund's investment portfolio initially
will not produce sufficient dividend and interest income to fully fund
distributions under the Managed Distribution Policy. Consequently, if the Fund
does not realize sufficient short-term capital gains and long-term capital
gains to make up any shortfall, distributions to the Fund's Common Stock
shareholders will include returns of capital. Prior to receipt of the above-
referenced exemptive order, long-term capital gains will be available to make
up any shortfall in funding distributions only on an annual basis, thereby
increasing the likelihood that distributions will include returns of capital
to shareholders. The Fund is not required to maintain the Managed Distribution
Policy and such policy (including the amount of the quarterly distribution)
may be modified or terminated at any time without notice. Any such modification
or termination of the Managed Distribution Policy may have an adverse effect
on the market price of the Fund's Common Stock.

           (iv) Potential Material Conflicts of Interest
</TABLE>


           BlackRock has built a professional working environment, firm-wide
           compliance culture and compliance procedures and systems designed to
           protect against potential incentives that may favor one account over
           another. BlackRock has adopted policies and procedures that address
           the allocation of investment opportunities, execution of portfolio
           transactions, personal trading by employees and other potential
           conflicts of interest that are designed to ensure that all client
           accounts are treated equitably over time. Nevertheless, BlackRock
           furnishes investment management and advisory services to numerous
           clients in addition to the Fund, and BlackRock may, consistent with
           applicable law, make investment recommendations to other clients or
           accounts (including accounts which are hedge funds or have
           performance or higher fees paid to BlackRock, or in which portfolio
           managers have a personal interest in the receipt of such fees),
           which may be the same as or different from those made to the Fund.
           In addition, BlackRock, its affiliates and any officer, director,
           stockholder or employee may or may not have an interest in the
           securities whose purchase and sale BlackRock recommends to the Fund.
           BlackRock, or any of its affiliates, or any officer, director,
           stockholder, employee or any member of their families may take
           different actions than those recommended to the Fund by BlackRock
           with respect to the same securities. Moreover, BlackRock may refrain
           from rendering any advice or services concerning securities of
           companies of which any of BlackRock's (or its affiliates') officers,
           directors or employees are directors or officers, or companies as to
           which BlackRock or any of its affiliates or the officers, directors
           and employees of any of them has any substantial economic interest
           or possesses material non-public information. Each portfolio manager
           also may manage accounts whose investment strategies may at times be
           opposed to the strategy utilized for the Fund. In this connection,
           it should be noted that certain portfolio managers currently manage
           certain accounts that are subject to performance fees. In addition,
           certain portfolio managers assist in managing certain hedge funds
           and may be entitled to receive a portion of any incentive fees
           earned on such funds and a portion of such incentive fees may be
           voluntarily or involuntarily deferred. Additional portfolio managers
           may in the future manage other such accounts or funds and may be
           entitled to receive incentive fees.

           As a fiduciary, BlackRock owes a duty of loyalty to its clients and
           must treat each client fairly. When BlackRock purchases or sells
           securities for more than one account, the trades must be allocated
           in a manner consistent with its fiduciary duties. BlackRock attempts
           to allocate investments in a fair and equitable manner among client
           accounts, with no account receiving preferential treatment. To this
           end, BlackRock has adopted a policy that is intended to ensure that
           investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among
           client accounts over time. This policy also seeks to achieve
           reasonable efficiency in client transactions and provide BlackRock
           with sufficient flexibility to allocate investments in a manner that
           is consistent with the particular investment discipline and client
           base.

           (a)(3) As of June 30, 2007:

           Portfolio Manager Compensation

                  Compensation Program
                  The elements of total compensation for portfolio managers on
           BlackRock's Quantitative Investments team include a fixed base
           salary, annual performance-based cash and stock compensation (cash
           and stock bonus) and other benefits. BlackRock has balanced these
           components of pay to provide these portfolio managers with a
           powerful incentive to achieve consistently superior investment
           performance. By design, compensation levels for these portfolio
           managers fluctuate--both up and down--with the relative investment
           performance of the portfolios that they manage.

                  Base compensation
                  Like that of many asset management firms, base salaries
           represent a relatively small portion of a portfolio manager's total
           compensation. This approach serves to enhance the motivational value
           of the performance-based (and therefore variable) compensation
           elements of the compensation program.

                  Performance-Based Compensation
                  BlackRock believes that the best interests of investors are
           served by recruiting and retaining exceptional asset management
           talent and managing their compensation within a consistent and
           disciplined framework that emphasizes pay for performance in the
           context of an intensely competitive market for talent. To that end,
           BlackRock and its affiliates portfolio manager incentive
           compensation is based on a formulaic compensation program.
           BlackRock's formulaic portfolio manager compensation program
           includes: investment performance over 1-, 3- and 5-year performance
           periods and a measure of operational efficiency. Portfolio managers
           are compensated based on the pre-tax performance of the products
           they manage. If a portfolio manager's tenure is less than 5 years,
           performance periods will reflect time in position. Portfolio
           managers are compensated based on products they manage. A
           discretionary element of portfolio manager compensation may include
           consideration of: financial results, expense control, profit
           margins, strategic planning and implementation, quality of client
           service, market share, corporate reputation, capital allocation,
           compliance and risk control, leadership, workforce diversity,
           supervision, technology and innovation. All factors are considered
           collectively by BlackRock management.

                  Long-Term Retention and Incentive Plan (LTIP)
                  The LTIP is a long-term incentive plan that seeks to reward
           certain key employees. The plan provides for the grant of awards
           that are expressed as an amount of cash that, if properly vested and
           subject to the attainment of certain performance goals, will be
           settled in cash and/or in BlackRock, Inc. common stock.

                  Cash Bonus
                  Performance-based compensation is distributed to portfolio
           managers in a combination of cash and stock. Typically, the cash
           bonus, when combined with base salary, represents more than 60% of
           total compensation for portfolio managers.

                  Stock Bonus
                  A portion of the dollar value of the total annual
           performance-based bonus is paid in restricted shares of BlackRock
           stock. Paying a portion of annual bonuses in stock puts compensation
           earned by a portfolio manager for a given year "at risk" based on
           the company's ability to sustain and improve its performance over
           future periods. The ultimate value of stock bonuses is dependent on
           future BlackRock stock price performance. As such, the stock bonus
           aligns each portfolio manager's financial interests with those of
           the BlackRock shareholders and encourages a balance between short-
           term goals and long-term strategic objectives. Management strongly
           believes that providing a significant portion of competitive
           performance-based compensation in stock is in the best interests of
           investors and shareholders. This approach ensures that portfolio
           managers participate as shareholders in both the "downside risk" and
           "upside opportunity" of the company's performance. Portfolio
           managers therefore have a direct incentive to protect BlackRock's
           reputation for integrity.

                  Other Compensation Programs
                  Portfolio managers who meet relative investment performance
           and financial management objectives during a performance year are
           eligible to participate in a deferred cash program. Awards under
           this program are in the form of deferred cash that may be
           benchmarked to a menu of BlackRock mutual funds (including their own
           fund) during a five-year vesting period. The deferred cash program
           aligns the interests of participating portfolio managers with the
           investment results of BlackRock products and promotes continuity of
           successful portfolio management teams.

                  Other Benefits
                  Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in broad-
           based plans offered generally to employees of BlackRock and its
           affiliates, including broad-based retirement, 401(k), health, and
           other employee benefit plans.
