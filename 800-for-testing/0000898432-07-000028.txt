CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to present to you this annual report for Neuberger Berman Real
Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006.
The report includes portfolio commentary, a listing of the Fund's investments,
and its audited financial statements for the reporting period.

The Fund seeks to provide high current income with capital appreciation as a
secondary objective. To pursue both, we have assembled a portfolio with a broad
mix of equity securities of real estate investment trusts and other real estate
companies.

Portfolio Manager Steven Brown's investment approach combines analysis of
security fundamentals and real estate with property sector diversification. His
disciplined valuation methodology seeks real estate company securities that are
attractively priced relative to both their historical growth rates and the
valuation of other property sectors.

We believe our conservative investment philosophy and disciplined investment
process will benefit you with superior returns over the long term.

Thank you for your confidence in Neuberger Berman. We will continue to do our
best to earn it.

Sincerely,


/s/ Peter Sundman

REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY

Improving commercial real estate fundamentals, increased merger and acquisition
activity, and a strong flow of funds from institutional and retail investors
translated into excellent gains for the real estate investment trust (REIT)
market in the 12 months ended October 31, 2006. REITs once again substantially
outperformed the broad equity markets, with the FTSE NAREIT Equity REITs Index
returning 36.36% versus the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 18.47%, the S&P 500's
16.33%, and the NASDAQ Composite's 11.62% respective gains. On a net asset value
(NAV) basis, Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (AMEX:
NRO) slightly outperformed the FTSE NAREIT benchmark for the fiscal year.

Office, Apartment, Diversified, and Health Care sector investments had an
especially positive impact on portfolio total return. Driven by job growth,
office REIT fundamentals continue to improve, with supply/demand dynamics
showing particular strength in coastal cities including New York, Washington, DC
and Los Angeles. Office occupancy rates have already trended higher,
foreshadowing higher lease prices in 2007. High home prices and higher mortgage
rates have finally undermined the new housing market, turning more potential
buyers into renters and improving the outlook for apartment REITs. We believe
this trend will remain intact until the housing market stabilizes.

Although an underweight compared to the benchmark, the relatively weak Regional
Mall sector made only a slightly positive contribution to portfolio total
return. We believe "retail" REITs (the Shopping Center and Regional Mall
sectors) may be vulnerable if ongoing weakness in the housing market undermines
consumer confidence and still high energy prices pinch consumer cash flows.

Commercial real estate fundamentals remain healthy. Rising demand and restrained
supply growth resulting from an estimated 10% to 20% increase in development
costs have translated into higher occupancy rates, increasing rental and lease
prices, and above average REIT earnings growth in most property sectors. With
REITs currently trading at 19 times earnings versus a historical average P/E of
12.2, strong earnings growth in the year ahead is at least partially discounted
in REIT valuations. Also, REITs' 4% average yield is well below the roughly 7%
historical average. However, it is important to remember that because REITs must
distribute at least 90% of earnings to shareholders, rising earnings translate
into dividend increases.

REITs have become more fully valued relative to historic average price/earnings
ratios and yield. Relative to net asset value (NAV), they are trading at their
historical average premium of 107%. This year alone, we have seen more than a
dozen publicly traded REITs taken over (in dollar volume, in excess of $25
billion), mostly by well-funded real estate opportunity funds. On average, these
deals are being done at a 10% to 15% premium to published NAVs--an indication
that NAVs should be revised upward to more accurately reflect "real world"
economic value. We expect institutional money to continue to flow into
alternative investment pools including real estate opportunity funds.
Consequently, we expect further consolidation in the REIT market to continue to
surface value.

Historically, REITs have delivered average annual percentage returns in the low
teens, with approximately 60% of the return coming from dividends and 40% from
price appreciation. In the year ahead, we believe that REITs are capable of
matching this historical return average with earnings- and deal activity-driven
price appreciation playing a bigger role in the total return equation.

REIT preferred stock yields are now in the 7.5% to 8% range, materially higher
than the yield on preferred shares in other stock market sectors and still
attractive relative to the current 4.6% yield on the 10-year Treasury note. If
the economy appears to be heading for a harder than anticipated landing and the
Federal Reserve begins to ease monetary policy in 2007, the capital appreciation
potential of REIT preferred stocks should improve.

Sincerely,


/s/ Steven R. Brown

NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

+    Investments in equity securities by Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities
     Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund") are valued at the latest sale price where
     that price is readily available; securities for which no sales were
     reported, unless otherwise noted, are valued at the last available bid
     price. Securities traded primarily on the NASDAQ Stock Market are normally
     valued by the Fund at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") provided
     by NASDAQ each business day. The NOCP is the most recently reported price
     as of 4:00:02 p.m., Eastern time, unless that price is outside the range of
     the "inside" bid and asked prices (i.e., the bid and asked prices that
     dealers quote to each other when trading for their own accounts); in that
     case, NASDAQ will adjust the price to equal the inside bid or asked price,
     whichever is closer. Because of delays in reporting trades, the NOCP may
     not be based on the price of the last trade to occur before the market
     closes. The Fund values all other securities, including securities for
     which the necessary last sale, asked and/or bid prices are not readily
     available, by methods the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") has
     approved on the belief that they reflect fair value. Numerous factors may
     be considered when determining the fair value of a security, including
     available analyst, media or other reports, trading in futures or ADRs and
     whether the issuer of the security being fair valued has other securities
     outstanding. Foreign security prices are furnished by independent quotation
     services and expressed in local currency values. Foreign security prices
     are currently translated from the local currency into U.S. dollars using
     the exchange rate as of 4:00 p.m., Eastern time. The Board has approved the
     use of FT Interactive Data Corporation ("FT Interactive") to assist in
     determining the fair value of the Fund's foreign equity securities when
     changes in the value of a certain index suggest that the closing prices on
     the foreign exchanges may no longer represent the amount that the Fund
     could expect to receive for those securities. In this event, FT Interactive
     will provide adjusted prices for certain foreign equity securities using a
     statistical analysis of historical correlations of multiple factors. In the
     absence of precise information about the market values of these foreign
     securities as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board has
     determined on the basis of available data that prices adjusted in this way
     are likely to be closer to the prices the Fund could realize on a current
     sale than are the prices of those securities established at the close of
     the foreign markets in which the securities primarily trade. However, fair
     value prices are necessarily estimates, and there is no assurance that such
     a price will be at or close to the price at which the security next trades.
     Short-term debt securities with less than 60 days until maturity may be
     valued at cost which, when combined with interest earned, approximates
     market value.

#    At cost, which approximates market value.

##   At October 31, 2006, the cost of investments for U.S. federal income tax
     purposes was $793,520,000. Gross unrealized appreciation of investments was
     $224,011,000 and gross unrealized depreciation of investments was $676,000,
     resulting in net unrealized appreciation of $223,335,000, based on cost for
     U.S. federal income tax purposes.

@    Neuberger Berman Prime Money Fund ("Prime Money") is also managed by
     Neuberger Berman Management Inc. (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements) and may be considered an affiliate since it has the same
     officers, Board members, and investment manager as the Fund and because, at
     times, the Fund may own 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of
     Prime Money.

@@   All or a portion of this security is on loan (see Note A of Notes to
     Financial Statements).

+++  Managed by an affiliate of Neuberger Berman Management Inc. and could be
     deemed an affiliate of the Fund (see Notes A & E of Notes to Financial
     Statements).

**   Restricted security subject to restrictions on resale under federal
     securities laws. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A
     and have been deemed by the investment manager to be liquid. At October 31,
     2006, these securities amounted to $1,272,000 or 0.2% of net assets
     applicable to common shareholders.

^^   All or a portion of this security is segregated as collateral for interest
     rate swap contracts.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC.

     NOTE A--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

1    GENERAL: Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the
     "Fund") was organized as a Maryland corporation on August 28, 2003 as a
     non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under the
     Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Board of
     Directors of the Fund (the "Board") may classify or re-classify any
     unissued shares of capital stock into one or more classes of preferred
     stock without the approval of shareholders.

     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
     accepted accounting principles requires Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
     ("Management") to make estimates and assumptions at the date of the
     financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

2    PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Investment securities are valued as indicated in the
     notes following the Schedule of Investments.

3    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Securities transactions are
     recorded on trade date for financial reporting purposes. Dividend income is
     recorded on the ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends included in dividend
     income, if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the securities
     received. Interest income, including accretion of original issue discount,
     where applicable, and accretion of discount on short-term investments, if
     any, is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses from
     securities transactions and foreign currency transactions, if any, are
     recorded on the basis of identified cost and stated separately in the
     Statement of Operations.

4    INCOME TAX INFORMATION: It is the policy of the Fund to continue to qualify
     as a regulated investment company by complying with the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
     investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its earnings to
     its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax provision is
     required.

     Income distributions and capital gain distributions are determined in
     accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily
     due to differing treatments of income and gains on various investment
     securities held by the Fund, timing differences and differing
     characterization of distributions made by the Fund as a whole.

     As determined on October 31, 2006, permanent differences resulting
     primarily from different book and tax accounting for distributions in
     excess of earnings and income recognized on interest rate swaps were
     reclassified at fiscal year-end. These reclassifications had no effect on
     net income, net asset value applicable to common shareholders or net asset
     value per common share of the Fund.

     The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October 31,
     2006 and October 31, 2005 was as follows:

                                               NEUBERGER BERMAN OCTOBER 31, 2006

     As of October 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings
     (accumulated losses) on a U.S. federal income tax basis were as follows:

UNDISTRIBUTED   UNDISTRIBUTED     UNREALIZED          LOSS
   ORDINARY       LONG-TERM      APPRECIATION    CARRYFORWARDS
    INCOME          GAIN        (DEPRECIATION)   AND DEFERRALS       TOTAL
     $--         $16,374,700     $229,040,155         $--        $245,414,855

     The difference between book and tax basis distributable earnings is
     attributable primarily to timing differences of distribution payments and
     income recognized on interest rate swaps.

5    DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: The Fund earns income, net of expenses,
     daily on its investments. It is the policy of the Fund to declare quarterly
     and pay monthly distributions to common shareholders. The Fund has adopted
     a policy to pay common shareholders a stable monthly distribution. The
     Fund's ability to satisfy its policy will depend on a number of factors,
     including the stability of income received from its investments, the
     availability of capital gains, distributions paid on preferred shares and
     the level of expenses. In an effort to maintain a stable distribution
     amount, the Fund may pay distributions consisting of net investment income,
     realized gains and paid-in capital. There is no assurance that the Fund
     will always be able to pay distributions of a particular size, or that
     distributions will consist solely of net investment income and realized
     capital gains. The composition of the Fund's distributions for the calendar
     year 2006 will be reported to Fund shareholders on IRS Form 1099DIV. The
     Fund may pay distributions in excess of those required by its stable
     distribution policy to avoid excise tax or to satisfy the requirements of
     Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code. Distributions to common
     shareholders are recorded on the ex-date. Net realized capital gains, if
     any, will be offset to the extent of any available capital loss
     carryforwards. Any such offset will not reduce the level of the stable
     distribution paid by the Fund. Distributions to preferred shareholders are
     accrued and determined as described in Note A-7.

     The Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities issued
     by real estate companies, including real estate investment trusts
     ("REITs"). The distributions the Fund receives from REITs are generally
     comprised of income, capital gains, and return of capital, but the REITs do
     not report this information to the Fund until the following calendar year.
     At October 31, 2006, the Fund estimated these amounts within the financial
     statements since the information is not available from the REITs until
     after the Fund's fiscal year-end. For the year ended October 31, 2006, the
     character of distributions paid to shareholders is disclosed within the
     Statement of Changes and is also based on these estimates. All estimates
     are based upon REIT information sources available to the Fund together with
     actual IRS Forms 1099DIV received to date. Based on past experience it is
     probable that a portion of the Fund's distributions during the current
     fiscal year will be considered tax return of capital but the actual amount
     of tax return of capital, if any, is not determinable until after the
     Fund's fiscal year end. After calendar year-end, when the Fund learns the
     nature of the distributions paid by REITs during that year, distributions
     previously identified as income are often recharacterized as return of
     capital and/or capital gain. After all applicable REITs have informed the
     Fund of the actual breakdown of distributions paid to the Fund during its
     fiscal year, estimates previously recorded are adjusted on the books of the
     Fund to reflect actual results. As a result, the composition of the Fund's
     distributions as reported herein may differ from the final composition
     determined after calendar year-end and reported to Fund shareholders on IRS
     Form 1099DIV.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. CONT'D

     On September 28, 2006, the Fund declared two monthly distributions to
     common shareholders in the amount of $0.10 per share per month, payable
     after the close of the reporting period, on November 30, 2006 and December
     29, 2006, to shareholders of record on November 15, 2006 and December 15,
     2006, respectively, with ex-dates of November 13, 2006 and December 13,
     2006, respectively.

6    EXPENSE ALLOCATION: Certain expenses are applicable to multiple funds.
     Expenses directly attributable to the Fund are charged to the Fund.
     Expenses borne by the complex of related investment companies, which
     includes open-end and closed-end investment companies for which Management
     serves as investment manager, that are not directly attributed to the Fund
     are allocated among the Fund and the other investment companies in the
     complex or series thereof on the basis of relative net assets, except where
     a more appropriate allocation of expenses to each investment company in the
     complex or series thereof can otherwise be made fairly.

7    REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SHARES: On December 10, 2003, the Fund re-classified
     12,000 unissued shares of capital stock as Series A Auction Market
     Preferred Shares, Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares, Series C
     Auction Market Preferred Shares and Series D Auction Market Preferred
     Shares ("AMPS"). On January 27, 2004, the Fund issued 2,450 Series A AMPS,
     2,450 Series B AMPS, 2,450 Series C AMPS and 2,450 Series D AMPS. All AMPS
     have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share plus any accumulated
     unpaid distributions, whether or not earned or declared by the Fund, but
     excluding interest thereon ("Liquidation Value").

     Except when the Fund has declared a special rate period, distributions to
     preferred shareholders, which are cumulative, are accrued daily and paid
     every 7 days for Series A and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C
     and Series D AMPS. Distribution rates are reset every 7 days for Series A
     and Series B AMPS and every 28 days for Series C and Series D AMPS based on
     the results of an auction, except during special rate periods. For the year
     ended October 31, 2006, distribution rates ranged from 3.90% to 5.15% for
     Series A, 3.73% to 5.15% for Series B, 3.90% to 5.35% for Series C and
     3.75% to 5.25% for Series D AMPS. The Fund declared distributions to
     preferred shareholders for the period November 1, 2006 to November 30, 2006
     of ($252,137, $255,542, $265,542 and $264,051) for Series A, Series B,
     Series C and Series D AMPS, respectively.

     The Fund may redeem AMPS, in whole or in part, on the second business day
     preceding any distribution payment date at Liquidation Value. The Fund is
     also subject to certain restrictions relating to the AMPS. Failure to
     comply with these restrictions could preclude the Fund from declaring any
     distributions to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or
     could trigger the mandatory redemption of AMPS at Liquidation Value. The
     holders of AMPS are entitled to one vote per share and will vote with
     holders of common shares as a single class, except that the AMPS will vote
     separately as a class on certain matters, as required by law or the Fund's
     charter. The holders of the AMPS, voting as a separate class, are entitled
     at all times to elect two Directors of the Fund, and to elect a majority of
     the Directors of the Fund if the Fund fails to pay distributions on AMPS
     for two consecutive years.

8    INTEREST RATE SWAPS: The Fund may enter into interest rate swap
     transactions, with institutions that Management has determined are
     creditworthy, to reduce the risk that an increase in short-term interest
     rates could reduce common share net earnings as a result of leverage. Under
     the terms of the interest rate swap contracts, the Fund agrees to pay the
     swap counter party a fixed-rate payment in exchange for the counter party's
     paying the Fund a variable-rate payment that is intended to approximate all
     or a portion of the Fund's variable-rate payment obligation on the Fund's
     AMPS. The fixed-rate and variable-rate payment flows are netted against
     each other, with the difference being paid by one party to the other on a
     monthly basis. The Fund segregates cash or liquid securities having a value
     at least equal to the Fund's net payment obligations under any swap
     transaction, marked to market daily.

     Risks may arise if the counter party to a swap contract fails to comply
     with the terms of its contract. The loss incurred by the failure of a
     counter party is generally limited to the net interest payment to be
     received by the Fund and/or the termination value at the end of the
     contract. Additionally, risks may arise from movements in interest rates
     unanticipated by Management.

     Periodic expected interim net interest payments or receipts on the swaps
     are recorded as an adjustment to unrealized gains/losses, along with the
     fair value of the future periodic payment streams on the swaps. The
     unrealized gains/losses associated with the periodic interim net interest
     payments are reclassified to realized gains/losses in conjunction with the
     actual net receipt or payment of such amounts. The reclassifications do not
     impact the Fund's total net assets applicable to common shareholders or its
     total net increase (decrease) in net assets applicable to common
     shareholders resulting from operations. At October 31, 2006, the Fund had
     outstanding interest rate swap contracts as follows:

9    SECURITY LENDING: Since 2005, a third party, eSecLending has assisted the
     Fund in conducting a bidding process to identify agents/principals that
     would pay a guaranteed amount to the Fund in consideration of the Fund
     entering into an exclusive securities lending arrangement.

     From October 4, 2005 to October 3, 2006, the Fund lent its securities to a
     single principal borrower that was selected through the bidding process.
     Through another bidding process in August 2006, and pursuant to an
     Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Fund
     selected Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger"), an affiliate of the Fund, to
     be its exclusive lending agent for a specified period. Under the agreement
     entered into between the Fund and Neuberger, Neuberger pays a guaranteed
     amount to the Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. CONT'D

     Under the securities lending arrangements arranged through eSecLending, the
     Fund receives cash collateral at the beginning of each transaction equal to
     at least 102% of the prior day's market value of the loaned securities
     (105% in the case of international securities). The Fund may invest all the
     cash collateral in Neuberger Berman Securities Lending Quality Fund, LLC
     ("Quality Fund"), a fund managed by Lehman Brothers Asset Management LLC,
     an affiliate of Management, as approved by the Board.

     Net income from the applicable lending program represents the guaranteed
     amount plus income earned on the cash collateral invested in Quality Fund
     or in other investments, less cash collateral fees and other expenses
     associated with the loans. For the year ended October 31, 2006, the Fund
     received net income under the securities lending arrangements of
     approximately $264,000, which is reflected in the Statement of Operations
     under the caption "Income from securities loaned-net." For the year ended
     October 31, 2006, "Income from securities loaned-net" consisted of
     approximately $2,226,000 in income earned on cash collateral and guaranteed
     amounts (including approximately $1,840,000 of interest income earned from
     the Quality Fund and $8,000 in guaranteed amounts received from Neuberger),
     less fees and expenses paid of approximately $1,962,000 (including
     approximately $6,000 retained by Neuberger).

10   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
     institutions that Management has determined are creditworthy. Each
     repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The Fund requires that the
     securities purchased in a repurchase agreement be transferred to the
     custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the Fund to assert a perfected
     security interest in those securities in the event of a default under the
     repurchase agreement. The Fund monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the
     securities transferred to ensure that their value, including accrued
     interest, is greater than amounts owed to the Fund under each such
     repurchase agreement.

11   TRANSACTIONS WITH OTHER FUNDS MANAGED BY NEUBERGER BERMAN MANAGEMENT INC.:
     Pursuant to an Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange
     Commission, the Fund may invest in a money market fund managed by
     Management or an affiliate. The Fund invests in Neuberger Berman Prime
     Money Fund ("Prime Money"), as approved by the Board. Prime Money seeks to
     provide the highest available current income consistent with safety and
     liquidity. For any cash that the Fund invests in Prime Money, Management
     waives a portion of its management fee equal to the management fee it
     receives from Prime Money on those assets (the "Arrangement"). For the year
     ended October 31, 2006, management fees waived under this Arrangement
     amounted to $4,821 and are reflected in the Statement of Operations under
     the caption "Investment management fees waived." For the year ended October
     31, 2006, income earned under this Arrangement amounted to $273,783 and is
     reflected in the Statement of Operations under the caption "Income from
     investments in affiliated issuers."

12   CONCENTRATION OF RISK: Under normal market conditions, the Fund's
     investments will be concentrated in income-producing common equity
     securities, preferred securities, convertible securities and
     non-convertible debt securities issued by companies deriving the majority
     of their revenue from the ownership, construction, financing, management
     and/or sale of commercial, industrial, and/or residential real estate. The
     value of the Fund's shares may fluctuate more due to economic, legal,
     cultural, geopolitical or technological developments affecting the United
     States real estate industry, or a segment of the United States real estate
     industry in which the Fund owns a substantial position, than would the
     shares of a fund not concentrated in the real estate industry.

13   INDEMNIFICATIONS: Like many other companies, the Fund's organizational
     documents provide that its officers and directors are indemnified against
     certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the
     Fund. In addition, both in some of its principal service contracts and in
     the normal course of its business, the Fund enters into contracts that
     provide indemnifications to other parties for certain types of losses or
     liabilities. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
     unknown as this could involve future claims against the Fund.

     NOTE B--MANAGEMENT FEES, ADMINISTRATION FEES, AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
     AFFILIATES:

     The Fund retains Management as its investment manager under a Management
     Agreement. For such investment management services, the Fund pays
     Management a fee at the annual rate of 0.60% of its average daily Managed
     Assets. Managed Assets equal the total assets of the Fund, less liabilities
     other than the aggregate indebtedness entered into for purposes of
     leverage. For purposes of calculating Managed Assets, the Liquidation Value
     of any AMPS outstanding is not considered a liability.

     Management has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management
     fees it is entitled to receive from the Fund at the following annual rates:

     YEAR ENDED       % OF AVERAGE
     OCTOBER 31,   DAILY MANAGED ASSETS
     ----------------------------------
     2006 - 2008       0.25
     2009              0.19
     2010              0.13
     2011              0.07

     Management has not contractually agreed to waive any portion of its fees
     beyond October 31, 2011.

     For the year ended October 31, 2006, such waived fees amounted to
     $2,139,412.

     The Fund retains Management as its administrator under an Administration
     Agreement. The Fund pays Management an administration fee at the annual
     rate of 0.25% of its average daily Managed Assets under this agreement.
     Additionally, Management retains State Street Bank and Trust Company
     ("State Street") as its sub-administrator under a Sub-Administration
     Agreement. Management pays State Street a fee for all services received
     under the agreement.

     Management and Neuberger, a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange and
     sub-adviser to the Fund, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers
     Holdings Inc. ("Lehman"), a publicly-owned holding company. Neuberger is
     retained by Management to furnish it with investment recommendations and
     research information without added cost to the Fund. Several individuals
     who are officers and/or Directors of the Fund are also employees of
     Neuberger and/or Management.

     The Fund has entered into a commission recapture program, which enables it
     to pay some of its operational expenses by recouping a portion of the
     commissions it pays to a broker that is not a related party of the Fund.
     Expenses paid through this program may include costs of custodial, transfer
     agency or accounting services. For the year ended October 31, 2006, the
     impact of this arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $20,136.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REAL ESTATE SECURITIES INCOME FUND INC. CONT'D

     The Fund has an expense offset arrangement in connection with its custodian
     contract. For the year ended October 31, 2006, the impact of this
     arrangement was a reduction of expenses of $5,938.

     In connection with the settlement of each AMPS auction, the Fund pays,
     through the auction agent, a service fee to each participating
     broker-dealer based upon the aggregate liquidation preference of the AMPS
     held by the broker-dealer's customers. For any auction preceding a rate
     period of less than one year, the service fee is paid at the annual rate of
     1/4 of 1%; for any auction preceding a rate period of one year or more, the
     service fee is paid at a rate agreed to by the Fund and the broker-dealer.

     In order to satisfy rating agencies' requirements, the Fund is required to
     provide each rating agency a report on a monthly basis verifying that the
     Fund is maintaining eligible assets having a discounted value equal to or
     greater than the Preferred Shares Basic Maintenance Amount, which is a
     minimum level set by each rating agency as one of the conditions to
     maintain the AAA/Aaa rating on the AMPS. "Discounted value" refers to the
     fact that the rating agencies require the Fund, in performing this
     calculation, to discount portfolio securities below their face value, at
     rates determined by the rating agencies. The Fund pays a fee to State
     Street for the preparation of this report, which is reflected in the
     Statement of Operations under the caption "Basic maintenance expense."

     NOTE C--SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS:

     During the year ended October 31, 2006, there were purchase and sale
     transactions (excluding short-term securities and interest rate swap
     contracts) of $118,966,692 and $91,276,242, respectively.

     During the year ended October 31, 2006, brokerage commissions on securities
     transactions amounted to $366,314, of which Neuberger received $14, Lehman
     Brothers Inc. received $58,709, and other brokers received $307,591.

*    Affiliated issuers, as defined in the 1940 Act.

**   Prime Money is also managed by Management and may be considered an
     affiliate since it has the same officers, Board members, and investment
     manager as the Fund and because, at times, the Fund may own 5% or more of
     the outstanding voting securities of Prime Money.

***  The Quality Fund, a fund managed by Lehman Brothers Asset Management LLC,
     an affiliate of Management, is used to invest cash the Fund receives as
     collateral for securities loans as approved by the Board. Because all
     shares of the Quality Fund are held by funds in the related investment
     management complex, the Quality Fund may be considered an affiliate of the
     Fund.

     NOTE F--RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:

     On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
     released FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
     Taxes" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions
     should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial
     statements. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by
     prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to
     meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
     that a "more-likely-than-not" threshold be met before the benefit of a tax
     position may be recognized in the financial statements and prescribes how
     such benefit should be measured. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal
     years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open
     tax years as of the effective date. At this time, Management is evaluating
     the implications of FIN 48 and its impact in the financial statements has
     not yet been determined.

     In September 2006, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 157, "Fair Value
     Measurement" ("SFAS 157"), which defines fair value, establishes a
     framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair
     value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
     November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
     Management believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material
     impact on the Fund's financial positions or results of operations.

+    Total return based on per share net asset value reflects the effects of
     changes in net asset value on the performance of the Fund during each
     fiscal period. Total return based on per share market value assumes the
     purchase of common shares at the market price on the first day and sales of
     common shares at the market price on the last day of the period indicated.
     Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed to be reinvested at prices
     obtained under the Fund's distribution reinvestment plan. Results represent
     past performance and do not guarantee future results. Current returns may
     be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment returns may
     fluctuate and shares when sold may be worth more or less than original
     cost. Total return would have been lower if Management had not waived a
     portion of the investment management fee.

     consideration any expense reductions related to expense offset
     arrangements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. (the "Fund"), including
the schedule of investments, as of October 31, 2006, and the related statement
of operations for the year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the periods indicated therein. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2006, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. at October 31, 2006,
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and its financial
highlights for each of the periods indicated therein, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Bank of New York ("Plan Agent") will act as Plan Agent for shareholders who
have not elected in writing to receive dividends and distributions in cash (each
a "Participant"), will open an account for each Participant under the
Distribution Reinvestment Plan ("Plan") in the same name as their then current
Shares are registered, and will put the Plan into effect for each Participant as
of the first record date for a dividend or capital gains distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or distribution with respect to the common
stock of the Fund ("Shares"), each Participant will receive such dividends and
distributions in additional Shares, including fractional Shares acquired by the
Plan Agent and credited to each Participant's account. If on the payment date
for a cash dividend or distribution, the net asset value is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan
Agent shall automatically receive such Shares, including fractions, for each
Participant's account. Except in the circumstances described in the next
paragraph, the number of additional Shares to be credited to each Participant's
account shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend or
distribution payable on their Shares by the greater of the net asset value per
Share determined as of the date of purchase or 95% of the then current market
price per Share on the payment date.

Should the net asset value per Share exceed the market price per Share plus
estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date for a cash dividend or
distribution, the Plan Agent or a broker-dealer selected by the Plan Agent shall
endeavor, for a purchase period lasting until the last business day before the
next date on which the Shares trade on an "ex-dividend" basis, but in no event,
except as provided below, more than 30 days after the payment date, to apply the
amount of such dividend or distribution on each Participant's Shares (less their
PRO RATA share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open-market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of such
dividend or distribution) to purchase Shares on the open market for each
Participant's account. No such purchases may be made more than 30 days after the
payment date for such dividend or distribution except where temporary
curtailment or suspension of purchase is necessary to comply with applicable
provisions of federal securities laws. If, at the close of business on any day
during the purchase period the net asset value per Share equals or is less than
the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Plan Agent
will not make any further open-market purchases in connection with the
reinvestment of such dividend or distribution. If the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full dividend or distribution amount through open-market purchases
during the purchase period, the Plan Agent shall request that, with respect to
the uninvested portion of such dividend or distribution amount, the Fund issue
new Shares at the close of business on the earlier of the last day of the
purchase period or the first day during the purchase period on which the net
asset value per Share equals or is less than the market price per Share, plus
estimated brokerage commissions, such Shares to be issued in accordance with the
terms specified in the third paragraph hereof. These newly issued Shares will be
valued at the then-current market price per Share at the time such Shares are to
be issued.

For purposes of making the reinvestment purchase comparison under the Plan, (a)
the market price of the Shares on a particular date shall be the last sales
price on the New York Stock Exchange (or if the Shares are not listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, such other exchange on which the Shares are principally
traded) on that date, or, if there is no sale on such Exchange (or if not so
listed, in the over-the-counter market) on that date, then the mean between the
closing bid and asked quotations for such Shares on such Exchange on such date
and (b) the net asset value per Share on a particular date shall be the net
asset value per Share most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund. All
dividends, distributions and other payments (whether made in cash or Shares)
shall be made net of any applicable withholding tax.

Open-market purchases provided for above may be made on any securities exchange
where the Fund's Shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Plan Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested funds
held by the Plan Agent will not bear interest, and it is understood that, in any
event, the Plan Agent shall have no liability in connection with any inability
to purchase Shares within 30 days after the initial date of such purchase as
herein provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Plan Agent
shall have no responsibility as to the value of the Shares acquired for each
Participant's account. For the purpose of cash investments, the Plan Agent may
commingle each Participant's funds with those of other shareholders of the Fund
for whom the Plan Agent similarly acts as agent, and the average price
(including brokerage commissions) of all Shares purchased by the Plan Agent as
Plan Agent shall be the price per Share allocable to each Participant in
connection therewith.

DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT PLAN CONT'D

The Plan Agent may hold each Participant's Shares acquired pursuant to the Plan
together with the Shares of other shareholders of the Fund acquired pursuant to
the Plan in noncertificated form in the Plan Agent's name or that of the Plan
Agent's nominee. The Plan Agent will forward to each Participant any proxy
solicitation material and will vote any Shares so held for each Participant only
in accordance with the instructions set forth on proxies returned by the
Participant to the Fund.

The Plan Agent will confirm to each Participant each acquisition made for their
account as soon as practicable but not later than 60 days after the date
thereof. Although each Participant may from time to time have an undivided
fractional interest (computed to three decimal places) in a Share, no
certificates for a fractional Share will be issued. However, dividends and
distributions on fractional Shares will be credited to each Participant's
account. In the event of termination of a Participant's account under the Plan,
the Plan Agent will adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at
the market value of the Shares at the time of termination, less the PRO RATA
expense of any sale required to make such an adjustment.

Any Share dividends or split Shares distributed by the Fund on Shares held by
the Plan Agent for Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event
that the Fund makes available to its shareholders rights to purchase additional
Shares or other securities, the Shares held for each Participant under the Plan
will be added to other Shares held by the Participant in calculating the number
of rights to be issued to each Participant.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling capital gains distributions or income
dividends will be paid by the Fund. Participants will be charged their PRO RATA
share of brokerage commissions on all open-market purchases.

Each Participant may terminate their account under the Plan by notifying the
Plan Agent in writing. Such termination will be effective immediately if the
Participant's notice is received by the Plan Agent not less than ten days prior
to any dividend or distribution record date, otherwise such termination will be
effective the first trading day after the payment date for such dividend or
distribution with respect to any subsequent dividend or distribution. The Plan
may be terminated by the Plan Agent or the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
each Participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of
any dividend or distribution by the Fund.

These terms and conditions may be amended or supplemented by the Plan Agent or
the Fund at any time or times but, except when necessary or appropriate to
comply with applicable law or the rules or policies of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each
Participant appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective
date thereof. The amendment or supplement shall be deemed to be accepted by each
Participant unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Plan Agent receives
written notice of the termination of their account under the Plan. Any such
amendment may include an appointment by the Plan Agent in its place and stead of
a successor Plan Agent under these terms and conditions, with full power and
authority to perform all or any of the acts to be performed by the Plan Agent
under these terms and conditions. Upon any such appointment of any Plan Agent
for the purpose of receiving dividends and distributions, the Fund will be
authorized to pay to such successor Plan Agent, for each Participant's account,
all dividends and distributions payable on Shares held in their name or under
the Plan for retention or application by such successor Plan Agent as provided
in these terms and conditions.

The Plan Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agrees to use its best
efforts within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services
performed under this Agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no
responsibility and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless
such error is caused by the Plan Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or that of its employees.

These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

MARYLAND ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES

By resolution of the Board of Directors, the Fund has opted into the Maryland
Control Share Acquisition Act and the Maryland Business Combination Act. In
general, the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that "control
shares" of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition may
not be voted except to the extent approved by shareholders at a special meeting
by a vote of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter
(excluding shares owned by the acquiror and by officers or directors who are
employees of the corporation). "Control shares" are voting shares of stock
which, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned by the acquiror or in
respect of which the acquiror is able to exercise or direct the exercise of
voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle the
acquiror to exercise voting power in electing directors within certain
statutorily-defined ranges (one-tenth but less than one-third, one-third but
less than a majority, and more than a majority of the voting power). In general,
the Maryland Business Combination Act prohibits an interested shareholder (a
shareholder that holds 10% or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock
of the corporation) of a Maryland corporation from engaging in a business
combination (generally defined to include a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, sale of a substantial amount of assets, a transfer of the
corporation's securities and similar transactions to or with the interested
shareholder or an entity affiliated with the interested shareholder) with the
corporation for a period of five years after the most recent date on which the
interested shareholder became an interested shareholder. The Fund is not aware
of any shareholder that holds control shares or that is an interested
shareholder under the statutes.

BOARD CONSIDERATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS

At a meeting held on September 27, 2006, the Board of Directors ("Board") of
Neuberger Berman Real Estate Securities Income Fund Inc. ("Fund"), including the
Directors who are not "interested persons" of the Fund ("Independent Fund
Directors"), approved continuance of the Management and Sub-Advisory Agreements
("Agreements") for the Fund.

In evaluating the Agreements, the Board, including the Independent Fund
Directors, reviewed materials furnished by Neuberger Berman Management Inc.
("Management") and Neuberger Berman, LLC ("Neuberger") in response to questions
submitted by counsel to the Independent Fund Directors, and met with senior
representatives of Management and Neuberger regarding their personnel and
operations. The Independent Fund Directors were advised by counsel that is
experienced in Investment Company Act of 1940 matters and that is independent of
Management and Neuberger. The Independent Fund Directors received a memorandum
from independent counsel discussing the legal standards for their consideration
of the proposed continuance of the Agreements. They met with such counsel
separately from representatives of Management to discuss the annual contract
review. The annual contract review extends over two regular meetings of the
Board to ensure that Management and Neuberger have time to respond to any
questions the Independent Fund Directors may have on their initial review of the
report and that the Independent Fund Directors have time to consider those
responses. In addition, during this process, the Board held a separate meeting
devoted to reviewing and discussing Fund performance.

The Board considered the following factors, among others, in connection with its
approval of the continuance of the Agreements: (1) the nature, extent, and
quality of the services provided by Management and Neuberger; (2) the
performance of the Fund compared to relevant market indices and a peer group of
investment companies; (3) the costs of the services provided and profits
historically realized by Management and its affiliates from the relationship
with the Fund; (4) the extent to which economies of scale might be realized as
the Fund grows; and (5) whether fee levels reflect those potential economies of
scale for the benefit of investors in the Fund. In their deliberations, the
Board members did not identify any particular information that was all-important
or controlling, and each Director may have attributed different weights to the
various factors.

The Board evaluated the terms of the Agreements and whether the Agreements were
in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The Board considered the
nature, extent and quality of the services provided under the Agreements and the
overall fairness of the Agreements to the Fund.

With respect to the nature, extent and quality of the services provided, the
Board considered the performance of the Fund and the degree of risk undertaken
by the portfolio manager. The Board considered the experience and staffing of
portfolio management and the investment research personnel of Management and
Neuberger dedicated to performing services for the Fund. The Board noted that
Management also provides certain administrative services, including fund
accounting and compliance oversight. The Board also considered Management's and
Neuberger's policies and practices regarding brokerage and allocation of
portfolio transactions for the Fund. The Board considered the quality of
brokerage execution provided by Management and its affiliates. The Board's
Portfolio Transactions and Pricing Committee from time to time reviews the
quality of the brokerage services that Neuberger and Lehman Brothers Inc.
provide, and has reviewed studies by an independent firm engaged to review and
evaluate the quality of brokerage execution received by the Fund. The Board also
reviewed whether Management and Neuberger used brokers to execute Fund
transactions that provide research and other services to Management and
Neuberger, and the types of benefits potentially derived by Management,
Neuberger, the Fund and by other clients of Management and Neuberger from such
services. In addition, the Board noted the positive compliance history of
Management and Neuberger, as each firm has been free of significant compliance
problems.

With respect to the performance of the Fund, the Board considered the
performance of the Fund on both a market return and net asset value basis
relative to its benchmark and a peer group of investment companies pursuing
broadly similar strategies. The Board also considered the performance in
relation to the degree of risk undertaken by the portfolio manager. The Board
noted the difficulty of constructing an appropriate peer group. The Board
discussed the Fund's performance with Management and discussed steps that
Management had taken, or intended to take, to improve the Fund's performance.
The Board also considered Management's resources and responsiveness with respect
to the Fund.

BOARD CONSIDERATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS CONT'D

With respect to the overall fairness of the Agreements, the Board considered the
fee structure of the Agreements as compared to a peer group of comparable funds
and any fall-out benefits likely to accrue to Management or Neuberger or their
affiliates. The Board also considered the profitability of Management and its
affiliates from their association with the Fund.

The Board reviewed a comparison of the Fund's management fee and overall expense
ratio to a peer group of comparable funds. The Board considered the mean and
median of the management fees and expense ratios of the peer group. With regard
to the sub-advisory fee paid to Neuberger, the Board noted that this fee is
reflective of an "at cost" basis and there is no profit to Neuberger with regard
to these fees. The Board considered the Fund's overall expenses in relation to
the overall expenses of the peer group mean and median. In addition, the Board
considered the contractual waiver of a portion of the management fee undertaken
by Management.

The Board considered whether there were other funds that were sub-advised by
Management or its affiliates or separate accounts managed by Management with
similar investment objectives, policies and strategies as the Fund. The Board
compared the fees charged to a comparable sub-advised fund and comparable
separate accounts to the fees charged to the Fund. The Board considered the
appropriateness and reasonableness of the differences between the fees charged
between the Fund and the comparable sub-advised fund and comparable separate
accounts and determined that the differences in fees were consistent with the
management and other services provided.

The Board also evaluated any actual or anticipated economies of scale in
relation to the services Management provides to the Fund. The Board considered
that the Fund was a closed-end fund that is not continuously offering shares and
that, without daily inflows and outflows of capital, there were not at this time
significant economies of scale to be realized by Management in managing the
Fund's assets.

In concluding that the benefits accruing to Management and its affiliates by
virtue of their relationship to the Fund were reasonable in comparison with the
costs of providing the investment advisory services and the benefits accruing to
the Fund, the Board reviewed specific data as to Management's profit on the Fund
for a recent period and the trend in profit or loss over time. The Board also
carefully examined Management's cost allocation methodology and had an
independent consultant review the methodology. It also reviewed an analysis from
an independent data service on investment management profitability margins. The
Board recognized that Management should be entitled to earn a reasonable level
of profits for services it provides to the Fund and, based on its review,
concluded it was satisfied that Management's level of profitability from its
relationship with the Fund was not excessive.

CONCLUSIONS

In approving the Agreements, the Board concluded that the terms of each
Agreement are fair and reasonable and that approval of the Agreements is in the
best interest of the Fund and its shareholders. In reaching this determination,
the Board considered that Management and Neuberger could be expected to provide
a high level of service to the Fund; that it retained confidence in Management's
and Neuberger's capabilities to manage the Fund; that the Fund's fee structure
appeared to the Board to be reasonable given the nature and quality of services
expected to be provided; and that the benefits accruing to Management and its
affiliates by virtue of their relationship to the Fund were reasonable in
comparison with the costs of providing the investment advisory services and the
benefits accruing to the Fund.

responsibility   to  vote  proxies   related  to  the  securities  held  in  the
Registrant's  portfolio.  Under this authority,  Neuberger Berman is required by
the Board to vote proxies related to portfolio  securities in the best interests
of the Registrant and its  stockholders.  The Board permits  Neuberger Berman to
contract  with a third  party to  obtain  proxy  voting  and  related  services,
including research of current issues.

Neuberger  Berman has  implemented  written Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
("Proxy  Voting  Policy") that are designed to reasonably  ensure that Neuberger
Berman votes proxies  prudently and in the best interest of its advisory clients
for whom Neuberger Berman has voting  authority,  including the Registrant.  The
Proxy Voting Policy also describes how Neuberger  Berman addresses any conflicts
that may arise  between its  interests  and those of its clients with respect to
proxy voting.

Neuberger  Berman's Proxy Committee is responsible for developing,  authorizing,
implementing  and updating the Proxy Voting Policy,  overseeing the proxy voting
process and engaging  and  overseeing  any  independent  third-party  vendors as
voting  delegate to review,  monitor and/or vote proxies.  In order to apply the
Proxy Voting  Policy noted above in a timely and  consistent  manner,  Neuberger
Berman utilizes Institutional  Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS") to vote proxies
in accordance with Neuberger Berman's voting guidelines.

Neuberger Berman's guidelines adopt the voting recommendations of ISS. Neuberger
Berman retains final  authority and fiduciary  responsibility  for proxy voting.
Neuberger  Berman  believes that this process is reasonably  designed to address
material  conflicts of interest  that may arise between  Neuberger  Berman and a
client as to how proxies are voted.

<PAGE>

In the event that an investment  professional at Neuberger  Berman believes that
it is in the best  interests  of a client or clients to vote proxies in a manner
inconsistent  with  Neuberger  Berman's  proxy voting  guidelines or in a manner
inconsistent  with  ISS   recommendations,   the  Proxy  Committee  will  review
information submitted by the investment  professional to determine that there is
no material  conflict of interest  between  Neuberger Berman and the client with
respect to the voting of the proxy in that manner.

If the Proxy  Committee  determines that the voting of a proxy as recommended by
the investment  professional  presents a material  conflict of interest  between
Neuberger  Berman and the client or  clients  with  respect to the voting of the
proxy, the Proxy Committee shall: (i) take no further action,  in which case ISS
shall vote such proxy in accordance  with the proxy voting  guidelines or as ISS
recommends;  (ii)  disclose  such  conflict  to the client or clients and obtain
written  direction  from the client as to how to vote the proxy;  (iii)  suggest
that the client or clients  engage  another  party to determine  how to vote the
proxy; or (iv) engage another  independent  third party to determine how to vote
the proxy.

Conflicts of Interest
- ---------------------

Actual or apparent  conflicts of interest may arise when a Portfolio Manager has
day-to-day  management  responsibilities  with  respect to more than one fund or
other  account.  The  management  of  multiple  funds  and  accounts  (including
proprietary  accounts)  may give rise to potential  conflicts of interest if the
funds and  accounts  have  different  or similar  objectives,  benchmarks,  time
horizons,  and  fees  as the  Portfolio  Manager  must  allocate  his  time  and
investment ideas across multiple funds and accounts.  The Portfolio  Manager may

<PAGE>

execute  transactions  for another fund or account that may adversely impact the
value of securities held by the  Registrant.  Moreover,  if a Portfolio  Manager
identifies a limited  investment  opportunity that may be suitable for more than
one fund or other account, the Registrant may not be able to take full advantage
of that  opportunity.  Securities  selected for funds or accounts other than the
Registrant  may  outperform  the  securities  selected  for the  Registrant.  NB
Management,  Neuberger Berman and the Registrant have adopted certain compliance
procedures  which are  designed to address  these types of  conflicts.  However,
there is no guarantee that such  procedures will detect each and every situation
in which a conflict arises.

(a)(3) Compensation (as of October 31, 2006)
       -------------------------------------

A portion of the  compensation  paid to the  Portfolio  Manager is determined by
comparisons to pre-determined peer groups and benchmarks, as opposed to a system
dependent on a percent of management fees. The Portfolio  Manager is paid a base
salary that is not dependent on  performance.  The Portfolio  Manager also has a
"target  bonus," which is set each year and can be increased or decreased  prior
to payment based in part on performance measured against the relevant peer group
and benchmark.  Performance is measured on a three-year rolling average in order
to emphasize  longer-term  performance.  There is also a subjective component to
determining  the  bonus,  which  consists  of the  following  factors:  (i)  the
individual's  willingness to work with the marketing and sales groups;  (ii) his
or her effectiveness in building a franchise; and (iii) client servicing. Senior
management  determines this component in appropriate cases. There are additional
components  that  comprise  the  Portfolio  Manager's   compensation   packages,
including:  (i) whether the manager was a partner/principal  of Neuberger Berman
prior to Neuberger Berman Inc.'s initial public  offering;  (ii) for more recent
hires,  incentives  that  may have  been  negotiated  at the time the  Portfolio
Manager  joined the  Neuberger  Berman  complex;  and (iii) the total  amount of
assets for which the Portfolio Manager is responsible.


NB Management's Portfolio Managers have always had a degree of independence that
they would not get at other firms that have, for example, investment committees.
NB Management believes that its Portfolio Managers are retained not only through
compensation  and  opportunities  for  advancement,  but also by a collegial and
stable money management environment.


In addition, there are additional stock and option award programs available.


NB Management  believes the  measurement  versus the peer groups on a three-year
rolling average basis creates a meaningful disincentive to try and beat the peer
group  and  benchmark  in any  given  year by taking  undue  risks in  portfolio
management.  The incentive is to be a solid performer over the longer-term,  not
necessarily to be a short-term winner in any given year.

(a)(4) Ownership of Securities
       -----------------------

the Portfolio Manager in the Registrant as of October 31, 2006.

There were no changes to the  procedures  by which  shareholders  may  recommend

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)    Based on an  evaluation of the  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as
       defined in rule  30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940, as
       amended  (the  "Act")) as of a date  within 90 days of the filing date of
       this document,  the Chief  Executive  Officer and Treasurer and Principal
       Financial and Accounting  Officer of the  Registrant  have concluded that
       such  disclosure  controls and  procedures  are  effectively  designed to
       ensure that  information  required to be disclosed by the  Registrant  on
       Form  N-CSR  and  Form  N-Q  is  accumulated  and   communicated  to  the
       Registrant's  management  to allow timely  decisions  regarding  required
       disclosure.

(b)    There were no significant  changes in the Registrant's  internal controls
       over financial reporting (as defined in rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that
       occurred  during the  Registrant's  second  fiscal  quarter of the period
       covered by this report that have  materially affected, or are  reasonably
       likely to  materially  affect,  the  Registrant's  internal  control over
       financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS

(a)(1) A copy of the Code of Ethics is incorporated by reference to Registrant's
       Form N-CSR,  Investment Company Act file number 811-21421 (filed July 10,

(a)(2) The  certifications  required by Rule 30a-2(a) of the Act and Section 302
       of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of  2002  ("Sarbanes-Oxley  Act")  are filed
       herewith.

(a)(3) Not applicable to the Registrant.

(b)    The  certifications  required by Rule 30a-2(b) of the Act and Section 906
       of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are filed herewith.

The certifications provided pursuant to Rule 30a-2(b) of the Act and Section 906
of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act are not deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of
the Exchange Act, or otherwise  subject to the  liability of that section.  Such
certifications  will not be  deemed to be  incorporated  by  reference  into any
filing  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 or the  Exchange  Act,  except to the
extent that the Registrant specifically incorporates them by reference.
