President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

The U.S. economy is moving forward on a slow path to recovery. We believe the
theme for the economy in 2011 may be modest but positive growth. The private
sector is showing signs of slow but steady improvement, led by higher capital
investment, solid exports, improved consumption, and gradually rising demand
for consumer auto loans and commercial loans. At the same time, the risks to a
steady recovery remain substantial, including the continued delays in the
housing sector's recovery, rising oil prices, and the fiscal drag of U.S.
federal and state budget cuts. We are concerned about the long-term risk of
inflation in an environment of accommodative Fed policy, continued low nominal
and "real" interest rates and rising commodity prices.

The recovery process may occur more slowly than many would like, and will
almost certainly be accompanied by short-term market swings. But our investment
professionals are finding good opportunities to invest. Through the first
quarter of 2011, although bonds remained popular with investors, we believed
there was value in the equity market. In both equity and bond markets, we are
finding good opportunities to invest using the same disciplined approach we
have used at Pioneer since 1928, which is to focus on identifying undervalued
individual securities with the greatest potential for success, carefully
weighing risk against reward. Our teams of investment professionals continually
monitor and analyze the relative valuations of different sectors and securities
globally to help build portfolios that we believe can help you achieve your
investment goals.

At Pioneer, we have long advocated the benefits of staying diversified and
investing for the long term. The strategy has generally performed well for many
investors. For instance, bond markets certainly rewarded investors for most of
2010, even though equity valuations seemed quite reasonable and were
inexpensive relative to bonds and compared with historic levels -- conditions
which represented potentially good value for long-term investors.

Our advice, as always, is to work closely with a trusted financial advisor to
discuss your goals and work together to develop an investment strategy that
meets your individual needs. There is no single best strategy that works for
every investor.

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/11

Floating-rate securities delivered strong returns during the six months ended
May 31, 2011, as new money entering the market drove up prices of floating-rate
loans. In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey, vice president and
portfolio manager at Pioneer, discusses the factors that affected the
performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during the six months ended May 31,
2011. Mr. Sharkey, a member of Pioneer's fixed-income team, is responsible for
the daily management of the Trust.

Q  How did the Trust perform over the six months ended May 31, 2011?

A  For the six-month period ended May 31, 2011, Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
   returned 10.50% at net asset value and 11.57% at market price, while the
   Trust's benchmark, the Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index (the
   Barclays Index), returned 4.49 %. Unlike the Trust, the benchmark is not
   leveraged. Over the same six-month period ended May 31, 2011, the average
   return (at market price) of the 29 closed end funds in Lipper's Closed-End
   Loan Participation Funds (Leveraged) category was 6.30%.

   As of May 31, 2011, the Trust was selling at a premium of market price to
   net asset value of 6.3%. Unlike open-ended funds, the market prices of
   closed end funds go up and down based on supply and demand, irrespective of
   a closed end fund's net asset value per share. It is not unusual to find
   closed-end funds trading at a discount or premium to their net asset value.
   In May 2011, the Trust increased the dividend rate 6.9%. The Trust was able
   to raise the dividend rate because the default rate on loans declined and
   because a number of lower-yielding loans in the portfolio were replaced
   with higher-yielding loans.

   On May 31, 2011, the Trust's 30-day SEC yield was 8.98%.

Q  What was the investment environment like during the six-month period ended
   May 31, 2011?

A  Early in the period, amid reports of a strengthening economy and rising
   corporate profits, yield-conscious investors gained confidence in credit
   risk and the possibility of higher interest rates and poured record amounts
   of new money into the bank-loan market. In December 2010, a new record for
   money inflows into the market was set, with investors putting nearly $3
   billion worth of new funds into bank loans. The record did not stand for
   very long, however, as about $6 billion of new money came into the market
   in January 2011 and another $8 billion was invested in February. The large
   volume of the new money drove up prices in the secondary market. At the
   same time, new issues were offered to investors. Eventually, companies that


4   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11
<PAGE>

   had obtained bank loans to finance their businesses began to refinance
   their debt to take advantage of the strong demand and to obtain new loans
   at lower interest rates, with more favorable terms. Between March and May
   2011, the bank-loan market became slightly more volatile. In March,
   concerns about Europe's sovereign debt problems and uncertainty regarding
   the effects of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan on the global economy
   resulted in a slight pullback in bank loans, but the pullback quickly
   abated. The bank-loan market rallied again in April. In May, unease about
   Europe's debt problems, concerns about the potential for a softer U.S.
   economic recovery and surging loan supply caused the bank-loan market once
   again to moderate. In addition, slower inflows into high-yield funds and
   tighter loan spreads reduced the appetite for loans among high-yield
   investors who cross over and invest in loans. In general, during the six
   months ended May 31, 2011, the average price on bank loans rose and spreads
   compressed as the "risk-on" demand from both loan and high-yield funds
   resulted in outperformance by lower-quality loans over higher-quality
   loans.

Q  How did you manage the Trust in that environment over the six months ended
   May 31, 2011?

A  We employed a barbell strategy in managing the Trust during the period,
   hedging more volatile investments in commodity companies with investments
   in more defensive securities, such as those in the health care and consumer
   staples industries. We reduced the Trust's exposure to broadcasting and
   increased its investments in finance and insurance companies, which
   included floating-rate catastrophe bonds. The Trust's position in CCC-rated
   securities declined during the six-month period as a result of
   refinancings, restructurings and upgrades.

Q  What factors most affected the Trust's performance over the six months ended
   May 31, 2011?

A  The average credit quality of the Trust's portfolio was in line with that of
   its benchmark the Barclays Index, but the Trust's heavier concentration in
   lower-quality securities provided the strongest results over the period.
   Investments in collateral loan obligations (CLOs) also helped boost the
   Trust's performance. Among individual securities, Infor Global, a software
   company, aided the Trust's return as the company refinanced portions of its
   outstanding loans and pursued a new acquisition. Spirit Finance, a
   diversified strip mall real estate investment trust (REIT), was a
   noteworthy contributor, as the firm's potential for an IPO increased in an
   improving commercial real estate market. Fenwal, a health care supply
   company, also figured prominently in the Trust's return, as did SMG H5, an
   Australian broadcasting company that made prepayments on its loans with
   proceeds from the addition of new equity holders. The effect of leverage
   also was instrumental in the Trust's outperformance relative to the
   Barclays Index.


                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11  5
<PAGE>

   There were some disappointments in the Trust's portfolio during the six
   months ended May 31, 2011. Muteki's floating-rate catastrophe bonds lost
   value in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. In health care,
   CCS Medical and TCD Pharma fared poorly. Broadstripe LLC, a regional cable
   company that remains in bankruptcy, saw its value diminish over the period
   as it became clear that potential suitors may offer a lower price than
   originally expected. In general, most of the Trust's holdings that declined
   during the six-month period ended May 31, 2011, were loans that had traded
   at a premium and were refinanced without call protection.

Q  Could you describe how leverage is used in managing the Trust?

A  Leverage is used in an effort to increase the yield of the Trust. Leverage
   was provided through the issuance of auction-rate preferred shares. The
   proceeds from the issuance of auction-rate preferred shares were used to
   increase the amount of assets available to be invested in additional
   portfolio securities. To the extent that dividend rates payable on
   auction-rate preferred shares are generally lower than the returns produced
   by investing in additional portfolio securities, the Trust's yield will be
   greater than what it would have been had the Trust's portfolio not been
   leveraged.

Q  How did the level of leverage employed by the Trust change over the six
   months ended May 31, 2011?

A  At the end of the Trust's fiscal year on May 31, 2011, 35.7% of the Trust's
   total managed assets were financed by leverage, compared with 37.3% of the
   Trust's total managed assets being financed by leverage at the start of the
   Trust's fiscal year (December 1, 2010).

Q  Did the Trust invest in any derivative securities over the six months ended
   May 31, 2011, and if so, did they have a material impact on the Trust's
   performance?

A  The Trust did not invest in any derivative securities over the six months
   ended May 31, 2011. However, on occasion, in times of currency volatility,
   the Trust may enter into foreign exchange derivatives (swaps) to mitigate
   foreign exchange risk for any future interest payments from an offshore
   borrower.

Q  What is your investment outlook?

A  We are two years into the economic recovery; and in May 2011, the default
   rate on floating-rate bank loans fell to a 38-month low. As the economy
   continues to recover, even though at a slower rate than originally thought,
   the default rate on bank loans should remain low. That scenario should
   provide a measure of net asset value (NAV) stability in the asset class. We
   believe the soft patch we have been experiencing with mixed economic
   indicators may push out any interest-rate increases by the U.S. Federal
   Reserve


6   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11
<PAGE>

   System. Over the past 18 months in a low-interest-rate environment, dollar
   prices on loans have risen, fueling strong returns. We do not believe that
   investors should expect those types of returns in the future. While bank
   loans may provide some capital appreciation, we think the bulk of returns
   are likely to be generated by higher short-term interest rates, which would
   lift yields offered by floating-rate loans. Such a development could be a
   positive for the Trust.

   Note to Shareowners: Effective March 1, 2011, the Trust's benchmark was
   changed from the Credit Suisse (CS) Leveraged Loan Index to the Barclays
   Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index, because the Trust's adviser believes
   that the Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield Loans Index is a more appropriate
   floating-rate bank-loan index for the Trust. For comparison purposes,
   Pioneer will continue to report performance for the Trust's former
   benchmark, the CS Leveraged Loan Index, over a 1-year period (two reporting
   cycles), including this semiannual report and the Trust's November 30,
   2011, annual report.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 12-37 for a full listing
of Trust securities.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when the
Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally
more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be
difficult to value, and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust currently uses leverage through the issuance of preferred shares. The
Trust also is authorized to borrow from banks and to issue debt securities,
which are other forms of leverage. Leverage creates significant risks,
including the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be
sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the return
for the holders of common shares. Since February of 2008, regularly scheduled
auctions for the Trust's preferred shares have failed and preferred shareowners
have not been able to sell their shares at auction. The Board of Trustees of
the Trust has considered, and continues to consider, this issue.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.


                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11  7
<PAGE>

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and rating agency asset
coverage requirements in connection with its outstanding preferred shares. In
order to maintain required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to
alter the composition of its investment portfolio or take other actions, such
as redeeming preferred shares with the proceeds from portfolio transactions, at
what might be inopportune times in the market. Such actions could reduce the
net earnings or returns to holders of the Trust's common shares over time.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee
that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic trends
or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of the opinion of the Trust's adviser as of the date of this report.
These statements should not be relied upon for any other purposes.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are
sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices
lower than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total
liabilities, which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of common
shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends
are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the Trust's dividend
reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.

The CS Leveraged Loan Index is a representative index of tradeable, senior,
secured U.S. dollar-denominated loans. The index began in January 1992.
Comparisons for this index begin in 2004. The Barclays Capital U.S. High Yield
Loans Index measures the performance of high-yield loans. Comparisons for this
index begin in 2006. Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment
of dividends and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or
sales charges. The indices do not employ leverage. You cannot invest directly
in an index.

These inputs are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

Highest priority is given to Level 1 inputs and lowest priority is given to
Level 3.

  Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
  Level 2 -- other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
             similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk,
             etc.)
  Level 3 -- significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
             assumptions in determining fair value of investments)

Generally, equity securities are categorized as Level 1, fixed income
securities and senior loans are categorized as Level 2 and securities valued
using fair value methods (See Note 1A) are categorized as Level 3.

Notes to Financial Statements | 5/31/11 (unaudited)

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a
diversified fund. The investment objective of the Trust is to provide a high
level of current income. The Trust will, as a secondary objective, also seek
preservation of capital to the extent consistent with its primary objective of
high current income.

Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
original offering prospectus with additional information included in the
Trust's shareowner reports issued from time to time. Please refer to those
documents when considering the Trust's principal risks. At times, the Trust's
investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated
or have common risks, making the Trust more susceptible to any economic,
political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries
and sectors.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, investment grade fixed-income debt securities and
high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below
investment grade securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly
referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These securities involve
greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less
liquid, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
that are in default or that are in bankruptcy. Additionally, the Trust may
invest in "event-linked" bonds, which sometimes are referred to as
"insurance-linked" or "catastrophe" bonds. The return of principal and the
payment of interest on event-linked bonds are contingent on the non-occurrence
of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a
specific magnitude. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked
bonds may expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
(credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
adverse tax consequences.

The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited or
developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a


                   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11  43
<PAGE>

developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency
exchange restrictions.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities
may be difficult to dispose of at a price reflective of their value at the
times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price
is generally more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid
securities are also more difficult to value and investment of the Trust's
assets in illiquid securities may restrict the Trust's ability to take
advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those policies generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A. Security Valuation

   Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Senior floating rate
   loan interests (Senior Loans) are valued in accordance with guidelines
   established by the Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available
   bid and asked prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from
   Loan Pricing Corporation. Senior loans for which no reliable price quotes are
   available will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
   pricing matrices to determine valuations. Fixed-income securities with
   remaining maturity of more than sixty days are valued at prices supplied by
   independent pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices,
   market events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
   maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by dealers and other
   sources, as required. Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are
   valued at the last sale price on the principal exchange where they are
   traded. Equity securities that have not traded on the date of valuation or
   securities for which sale prices are not available, generally are valued
   using the mean between the last bid and asked prices. Equity securities or
   loan interests for which independent pricing services are unable to supply
   prices or for which market prices and/or quotations are not readily available
   or are considered to be unreliable are valued using fair value methods
   pursuant to procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees.


44   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11
<PAGE>

   Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at various
   times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of such securities used in
   computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are determined as of such
   times.

   The Trust may use fair value methods if it is determined that a significant
   event has occurred after the close of the exchange or market on which the
   security trades and prior to the determination of the Trust's net asset
   value. Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may differ from exchange
   prices.

   At May 31, 2011, twenty-six securities were valued using fair value methods
   (in addition to securities valued using prices supplied by independent
   pricing services) representing 3.4% of net assets applicable to common
   shareowners. Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security
   may include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
   market conditions and comparable securities. Short-term fixed income
   securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less generally are
   valued at amortized cost. Money market mutual funds are valued at net asset
   value.

   Discounts and premiums on debt securities are accreted or amortized,
   respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective yield to maturity
   basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost basis of the
   security. Interest income, including income on interest bearing cash
   accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign taxes
   withheld at the applicable country rates.

   Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
   dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed
   are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend data in
   the exercise of reasonable diligence.

   Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
   cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B. Foreign Currency Translation

   The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
   denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
   current exchange rates.

   Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
   represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
   currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
   between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
   Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
   investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
   effects of changes in market prices of those securities but are included with
   the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.


                   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11  45
<PAGE>

C. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

   The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts) for
   the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a
   future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the applicable
   exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized gains or losses are recorded in
   the Trust's financial statements. The Trust records realized gains and losses
   at the time a portfolio hedge is offset by entry into a closing transaction
   or extinguished by delivery of the currency. Risks may arise upon entering
   into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to meet
   the terms of the contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value of
   foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 5).

D. Federal Income Taxes

   It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
   Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
   all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
   shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Tax
   returns for the prior three fiscal years remain subject to examination by tax
   authorities.

   The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
   financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal income
   tax rules. Therefore, the sources of the Trust's distributions may be shown
   in the accompanying financial statements as from or in excess of net
   investment income or as from net realized gain (loss) on investments and
   foreign currency transactions, or as from paid-in capital, depending on the
   type of book/tax differences that may exist.

   The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and preferred
   shareowners will be determined at the end of the fiscal year. Distributions
   paid during the year ended November 30, 2010 was as follows:

   =============================================================================
</TABLE>

   The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
   primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
   methods for premiums and discounts on fixed-income securities, book/tax
   differences in the accrual of income on securities in default and the
   realization of unrealized gain on investments in passive foreign investment
   companies.

E. Repurchase Agreements

   With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value of
   the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest, is
   required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price. The collateral
   for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
   account of the Trust's custodian or a subcustodian of the Trust. The Trust's
   investment adviser, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM), is responsible
   for determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to
   the repurchase price.

F. Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

   All common shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
   automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
   Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
   distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional common shares
   of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
   Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
   capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely
   voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by
   notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for shareowners
   in administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to any dividend
   record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with
   respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

   If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
   other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
   the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
   the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A firm
   or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividend in common shares of the
   Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the plan.


                   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11  47
<PAGE>

   Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
   participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
   acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued
   but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
   outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on
   the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common share is
   equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
   trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount
   in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common shares to be
   credited to each account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of
   the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the date the shares
   are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then current market
   price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the
   payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share is
   greater than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent will invest
   the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market purchases. There
   are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued common shares. However,
   each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
   with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the
   Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes
   which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding
   Plan shares in a brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to
   another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.


2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit),
manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's
Advisory Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of
the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the total
assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b) all
accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which shall
not include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage
obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation,
borrowing through a credit facility of the issuance of debt securities), (ii)
the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference securities, and/or
(iii) any other means. For the six months ended May 31, 2011, the net
management fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets, which was
equivalent to 1.10% of the Trust's average daily net assets attributable to the
common shareowners.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At May
31, 2011, $573,789 was payable to PIM related to management costs,


48   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/11
<PAGE>

administrative costs and certain other reimbursements and is included in "Due
to affiliates" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

Effective September 1, 2010, PIM has retained State Street Bank and Trust
Company (State Street) to provide certain administrative and accounting
services to the Trust on its behalf. For such services, PIM pays State Street a
monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the Trust's average daily managed
assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed assets in excess
of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly fee of $10,000. Previously, PIM
had retained Princeton Administrators, LLC (Princeton) to provide such
services. PIM paid Princeton a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.07% of the
Trust's average daily managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average
daily managed assets in excess of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly
fee of $10,000. Neither State Street nor Princeton received compensation
directly from the Trust for providing such services.

3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement
with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all
transfer agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at
negotiated rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) is the
transfer agent, registrar, dividend paying agent and auction agent with respect
to the Trust's Auction Market Preferred Shares (AMPS). The Trust pays Deutsche
Bank an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust and Deutsche
Bank, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimburses PIMSS for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
PIMSS related to shareowner communications activities such as proxy and
statement mailings and outgoing phone calls.

4. Expense Offset Arrangement

The Trust has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion
of the Trust's custodian expenses. For the six months ended May 31, 2011, the
Trust expenses were not reduced under such arrangement.

5. Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

The Trust may enter into any forward foreign currency contracts that obligate
the Trust to deliver or take delivery of currencies at specified future
maturity dates. Alternatively, prior to the settlement date of a forward
foreign currency contract, the Trust may close out such contract by entering
into an offsetting contract.

There were no open portfolio hedges on May 31, 2011.

</TABLE>

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of beneficial interest
into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As of May
31, 2011, there were 7,298 AMPS as follows: Series M7-2,434, Series W7-2,432
and Series TH7-2,432.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is to be reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. An auction
fails if there are more AMPS offered for sale than there are buyers. When an
auction fails, the dividend rate for the period will be the maximum rate on the
auction dates described in the prospectus for the AMPS. Preferred shareowners
are not able to sell their AMPS at an auction if the auction fails. Since
February 2008, the Trust's auctions related to the AMPS have failed. The
maximum rate for each series is the greater of 125% of the one week LIBOR rate
or the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.25%. Dividend rates on AMPS ranged from
1.413% to 1.505% during the six months ended May 31, 2011.

<PAGE>

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, the Trust does not comply with the asset coverage
ratios described in the prospectus for the AMPS.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Statement of
Preferences are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. Holders of AMPS are also entitled to elect two
of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might otherwise
be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any outstanding
preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to (a) adopt
any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred shares and
(b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders, including, among
other things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.

8. Pending Litigation

The Trust is currently involved in litigation matters relating to Trust
investments. The Trust believes these claims are without merit and is defending
them vigorously. At May 31, 2011, it is reasonably possible that adverse
outcomes may result. Currently, the amount of either judgment cannot be
reasonably estimated.

9. Subsequent Events

The Board of Trustees of the Trust declared on June 3, 2011 a dividend from
undistributed net investment income of $0.08 per common share payable June 30,
2011 to common shareowners of record on June 15, 2011.

Subsequent to May 31, 2011, dividends declared and paid on preferred shares
totaled $333,850 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share series
through July 22, 2011.

In preparing these financials statements, PIM has evaluated the impact of all
events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure, and has
determined that other than disclosed above, there were no subsequent events
requiring recognition or disclosure in the financials statements.

functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the
registrant or a third party, and that relates to any element of the code of
ethics definition enumerated in paragraph (b) of this Item. The registrant must

        report on this Form N-CSR;

        (2) Post the text of such code of ethics on its Internet website and

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                 firm, the scope of the Audit
