President's Letter

Dear Shareowner,

Stock and bond markets around the globe have begun to recover over the past
year from one of their most tumultuous periods in history. This is a welcome
relief, and we are generally optimistic about the prospects for the economy
going forward. Still, challenges remain. Unemployment is high; consumer demand
and loan growth are weak; and housing has not returned to normal.

At Pioneer, we have long advocated the benefits of investing for the long term.
This strategy has generally performed well for many investors. Those who
remained invested in the market during the downturn have most likely seen their
portfolios start to recover over the past year, as the Dow Jones Industrial
Average climbed back from the depressed levels we saw in early 2009. Many bond
investors have similarly seen a strong rebound, with a broad-based recovery
occurring across many different fixed-income asset classes. The riskiest asset
classes, such as high-yield bonds, outperformed other fixed-income asset
classes during most of 2009.

At Pioneer, we are not changing the approach to investing that we have used for
more than 80 years. We remain focused on company fundamentals and risk
management. Our investment process is based on careful research into individual
companies, quantitative analysis, and active portfolio management. This
three-pillared process, which we apply to each of our portfolios, is supported
by an integrated team approach and is designed to carefully balance risk and
reward. While we see potential opportunities for making money in many corners
of the markets around the globe, it takes research and experience to separate
solid investment opportunities from speculation.

Following this difficult period, many investors are rethinking their approach
to investing and risk management. Some are questioning whether the basic
investment principles they were taught in the past are still useful in today's
markets. Complicating matters is that financial markets remain unpredictable.
Our advice, as always, is to work closely with a trusted financial advisor to
discuss your goals and work together to develop an investment strategy that
meets your individual needs. There is no single best strategy that works for
every investor.

investing by consulting with your financial advisor or visiting us online at

you for investing with Pioneer.

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/10

Floating-rate loans produced relatively strong results during the six months
ended May 31, 2010, as defaults declined and the market returned to more normal
conditions after the turmoil of 2008 and 2009. In the following interview,
Jonathan Sharkey discusses the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
during the six months ended May 31, 2010. Mr. Sharkey, a member of Pioneer's
Fixed-Income Department, is responsible for the daily management of the Trust.

Q  How did the Trust perform over the six months ended May 31, 2010?

A  For the six-month period ended May 31, 2010, Pioneer Floating Rate Trust
   returned 9.70% at net asset value and 9.27% at market price. The Trust's
   benchmark, the Credit Suisse (CS) Leveraged Loan Index (the Credit Suisse
   Index), returned 6.28% over the same period. Unlike the Trust, the Credit
   Suisse Index does not employ leverage. On May 31, 2010, the Trust's SEC
   yield was 10.69% at market price.

   On May 31, 2010, the Trust's common shares were selling at a premium of
   market price-to-net asset value of 0.83%. Unlike open-ended funds, the
   market prices of closed-end fund shares go up and down based on supply and
   demand, irrespective of a closed-end fund's net asset value per share. It
   is not unusual to find closed-end fund shares trading at a discount or
   premium to their net asset value. In May 2010, we reduced the Trust's
   dividend rate, as the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) remained
   relatively stable and some of the riskier loans and bonds with higher
   yields in the Trust's portfolio were paid off with refinancing due to
   stronger credit markets and as a result were replenished with somewhat
   lower yielding loans. These loans were, in general, lower yielding but of
   higher quality leading to an improvement in the overall quality in the
   portfolio. The Trust's default rate was greater than the Credit Suisse
   Index, but it continues to decline.

Q  What was the investment environment like during the six-month period ended
   May 31, 2010?

A  During the first five months of the period (December 2009 through April
   2010), floating-rate bank loans, along with other credit-sensitive
   investments, performed well, as investors poured money into the market.
   Prices of bank loans were also supported by the heavy new issuance of
   high-yield bonds, many of which were used to retire existing bank loans.
   Issuance of bank loans also increased, with newer issues generally offering
   better yields compared to more seasoned loans with similar ratings. In the
   floating-rate loan market, lower-rated loans appreciated more than
   higher-quality, less

4   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/10
<PAGE>

   risky investments, as we continued to see buying of more distressed names
   by high-yield and hedge fund investors.

   In May, however, the floating-rate loan market, as measured by the Credit
   Suisse (CS) Leveraged Loan Index, declined by 2.06%. This represents the
   first monthly decline since December 2008. Several factors contributed to
   the downturn in floating-rate loans, including: debt problems in Europe; a
   decline in new issuance of high-yield debt, which reduced bond-for-loan
   take-out activity; and relatively weak investor demand for bank loans by
   high-yield investors and hedge funds, as high-yield securities became cheap
   relative to bank loans.

Q  Can you comment on the use of leverage in the Trust's portfolio?

A  We believe the use of leverage for investment purposes can increase
   investment opportunity, as well as investment risk. The Trust uses
   financial leverage primarily in an effort to increase the dividend yield to
   common shareowners. The Trust uses auction-rate preferred shares to provide
   leverage. Over the six months ended May 31, 2010, leverage was a
   contributor to the Trust's performance relative to the benchmark Credit
   Suisse Index.

Q  How did you manage the Trust during the six-month period ended May 31, 2010?

A  We increased the Trust's diversification, adding higher-quality names. We
   favored investments in areas that we believe are poised to benefit from an
   improved economy. To that end, we lightened-up the Trust's holdings in the
   more defensive sectors of health care, utilities and energy, and added
   holdings in technology and transportation, where we saw improving trends.
   The largest position in the Trust's portfolio was in loans to consumer
   companies, which represented 25.2% of the Trust's total investment
   portfolio at the end of the period. The consumer sector has a wide reach
   and includes food suppliers, service companies, consumer staples companies,
   specialty retailers, gaming, building products and auto parts suppliers.

   We kept the Trust's total investment portfolio fully invested during the
   period. At May 31, 2010, 94% of the Trust's total investment portfolio was
   invested in loans rated "B" or higher, while 5% was invested in
   lower-quality obligations rated "CCC" or lower(1). This was less than the
   Credit Suisse (CS) Leveraged Loan Index which had 10.2% rated CCC or lower.
   Our average blended (better of S&P or Moody's) was BB -- versus the index
   which had a B average rating.

1  Source: Moody's and S&P. If the ratings provided by Moody's and S&P for a
   security differ, the higher of the two ratings is used.

<PAGE>

Q  What were some of the individual investments that affected the Trust's
   performance during the six months ended May 31, 2010?

A  Airline investments contributed to the Trust's performance during the period,
   as did several holdings in the industrials sector, including Manitowoc, a
   farm and construction machinery company, and Chemtura, a chemical company.
   Among the Trust's technology investments, Flextronics, an electronics
   manufacturing services company, and Intersil, a semiconductor manufacturer,
   were notable contributors. Other individual contributors included: Reynolds
   and Reynolds, a provider of services to automobile dealers; Young
   Broadcasting, a media company that emerged from bankruptcy; Spirit Finance,
   a diversified real estate investment trust that is recovering from problems
   in the commercial real estate sector; and LifeCare Solutions, a health care
   management company.

   The Trust's poorer-performing investments during the period included
   Molecular Insight, a pharmaceutical company that is falling behind the
   plan; MGM, an entertainment giant which is seeking a buyer; and BroadStripe
   (formerly Millennium Digital Media), which remains in bankruptcy.

Q  What is your investment outlook?

A  While the floating-rate loan market experienced significant market volatility
   in May 2010, it was nowhere near the level of volatility that characterized
   the credit markets in 2008 and 2009. We believe the severe market
   volatility of 2008 and 2009 is abating and that the investment environment
   will return to conditions more closely resembling long-term historical
   trends. We think the Trust, which has shown solid relative performance on a
   longer-term basis, should be well positioned as market trends evolve and
   normalize.

   We believe bank loans should perform well relative to other asset classes
   on a risk-adjusted basis. The default rate on bank loans continues to
   decline; as a result, we believe the asset class is poised to do well.
   Despite continued high unemployment, we expect that the Federal Reserve
   Board will raise interest rates, although at a somewhat later date than we
   originally thought. Floating-rate loans have a distinct advantage over most
   other yield-oriented investments in that they have the potential to
   increase income to investors as interest rates rise. In the current
   environment, bank loans are selling at discounts; as a result, appropriate
   investors may also have an opportunity for capital appreciation.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 12-35 for a full listing
of Trust securities.

Information regarding the Trust's principal investment risks is contained in
the Trust's original offering prospectus and shareowner reports from time to
time. Please refer to these documents when considering the Trust's risks.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in floating-rate senior loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid.
Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when the
Trust believes it is desirable to do so and their market price is generally
more volatile than that of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be
difficult to value, and investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities
may restrict the Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust currently uses leverage through the issuance of preferred shares. The
Trust also is authorized to borrow from banks and to issue debt securities,
which are other forms of leverage. Leverage creates significant risks,
including the risk that the Trust's income or capital appreciation will not be
sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely affect the return
for the holders of common shares. Since February of 2008, regularly scheduled
auctions for the Trust's preferred shares have failed and preferred shareowners
have not been able to sell their shares at auction. The Board of Trustees of
the Trust has considered, and continues to consider, this issue.

The Trust is not diversified, which means that it can invest a higher
percentage of its assets in the securities of any one issuer than a diversified
fund. Being non-diversified may magnify the Trust's losses from adverse events
affecting a particular issuer.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and rating agency asset
coverage requirements in connection with its outstanding preferred shares. In
order to maintain required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to
alter the composition of its investment portfolio or take other actions, such
as redeeming preferred shares with the proceeds from portfolio transactions, at
what might be inopportune times in the market. Such actions could reduce the
net earnings or returns to holders of the Trust's common shares over time.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results, and there is no guarantee
that market forecasts discussed will be realized.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit pioneerinvestments.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below Net Asset Value (NAV), due to such factors as
interest rate changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for common shares of the Trust.

Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is
a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are
sold in the open market through a stock exchange and frequently trade at prices
lower than their NAV. NAV per common share is total assets less total
liabilities, which includes preferred shares, divided by the number of common
shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher than market
price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions.

Index comparison begins on 12/31/04. The CS Leveraged Loan Index is a
representative index of tradeable, senior, secured U.S. dollar-denominated
loans. The index began in January 1992. Index returns are calculated monthly,
assume reinvestment of dividends and, unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any
fees, expenses or sales charges. The index is not leveraged. You cannot invest
directly in an index.

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The investment objective
of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income. The Trust will, as a
secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital to the extent consistent
with its primary objective of high current income.

Information regarding the Trust's principal risks is contained in the Trust's
original offering prospectus with additional information included in the
Trust's shareowner reports from time to time. Please refer to those documents
when considering the Trust's risks. At times, the Trust's investments may
represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common
risks, making it more susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory
developments or other risks affecting those industries and sectors.

The Trust invests primarily in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). The
Trust may also invest in other floating and variable rate instruments,
including second lien loans, investment grade fixed-income debt securities and
high yield, high risk corporate bonds. The Trust may also invest in below
investment grade securities. Below investment grade securities are commonly
referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. These securities involve
greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and are less
liquid, especially during periods of economic uncertainty or change, than
higher rated debt securities. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers
that are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

The Trust's investments in certain foreign markets or countries with limited
developing markets may subject the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a
developed market. These risks include disruptive political or economic
conditions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency
exchange restrictions.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in Senior Loans and other securities deemed to be illiquid. Illiquid securities
may be difficult to sell at a fair price at times when the Trust believes it is
desirable to do so and their market price is generally more volatile than that
of more liquid securities. Illiquid securities also may be more difficult to
value and

                   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/10  41
<PAGE>

investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the
Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles that require the management of the
Trust to, among other things, make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gains and losses on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in preparation of its financial statements, which are consistent with
those generally accepted in the investment company industry:

A. Security Valuation

   Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. The net asset value of
   the Trust is computed once daily, on each day the New York Stock Exchange
   (NYSE) is open, as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE. Senior Loans
   are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the Board of Trustees
   at the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or more
   brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the limited
   number of Senior Loans for which no reliable price quotes are available, such
   Senior Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
   pricing matrices to determine valuations. Fixed-income securities with
   remaining maturities of more than sixty days are valued at prices supplied by
   independent pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices,
   market events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
   maturities and ratings. Valuations may be supplemented by dealers and other
   sources, as required. Equity securities are valued at the last sale price on
   the principal exchange where they are traded. Securities or loans for which
   market prices and/or quotations are not readily available or are considered
   to be unreliable are valued using fair value methods pursuant to procedures
   adopted by the Board of Trustees.

   Trading in foreign securities is substantially completed each day at various
   times prior to the close of the NYSE. The values of such securities used in
   computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are determined as of such
   times.

   The Trust may use fair value methods if it is determined that a significant
   event has occurred after the close of the exchange or market on which the
   security trades and prior to the determination of the Trust's net asset
   value. Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may differ from exchange
   prices. At May 31, 2010, 21 securities were valued using fair value methods
   (other than securities valued using prices supplied by independent pricing
   services)

42   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/10
<PAGE>

   representing 4.2% of net assets applicable to common shareowners. Inputs used
   in the valuation of a security using fair value methods include credit
   ratings, the financial condition of the company, current market conditions
   and comparable securities. Short-term fixed income securities with remaining
   maturities of sixty days or less generally are valued at amortized cost.

   Discounts and premiums on debt securities are accreted or amortized,
   respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective yield to maturity
   basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the cost basis of the
   security. Interest income, including income on interest bearing cash
   accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis, net of unrecoverable foreign taxes
   withheld at the applicable country rates.

   Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
   dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have passed
   are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend data in
   the exercise of reasonable diligence.

   Gains and losses on sales of investments are calculated on the identified
   cost method for both financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

B. Foreign Currency Translation

   The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
   denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
   current exchange rates.

   Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
   represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on foreign
   currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the difference
   between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars actually received.
   Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on
   investments are not segregated in the Statement of Operations from the
   effects of changes in market prices of those securities but are included with
   the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments.

C. Federal Income Taxes

   It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
   Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
   all of its taxable income and net realized capital gains, if any, to its
   shareowners. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Tax
   returns for the prior three fiscal years remain subject to examination by tax
   authorities.

   The amounts and characterizations of distributions to shareowners for
   financial reporting purposes are determined in accordance with federal income
   tax rules. Therefore, the sources of the Trust's distributions may be shown
   in the accompanying financial statements as from or in excess of net
   investment income or net realized gain (loss) on investments and foreign

                   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/10  43
<PAGE>

   currency transactions, or as from paid-in capital, depending on the type of
   book/tax differences that may exist.

   The tax character of current year distributions paid to common and preferred
   shareowners will be determined at the end of the fiscal year. Distributions
   paid during the year ended November 30, 2009 were as follows:

   =========================================================================
</TABLE>

   The difference between book-basis and tax-basis unrealized depreciation is
   primarily attributable to the difference between book and tax amortization
   methods for premiums and discounts on fixed-income securities, book/tax
   differences in the accrual of income on securities in default and the
   realization of unrealized gain on investments in passive foreign investment
   companies.

D. Repurchase Agreements

   With respect to repurchase agreements entered into by the Trust, the value of
   the underlying securities (collateral), including accrued interest, is
   required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price. The collateral
   for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the customer-only
   account of the Trust's custodian or a sub custodian of the Trust. The Trust's
   investment adviser, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (PIM), is responsible
   for determining that the value of the collateral remains at least equal to
   the repurchase price.

E. Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

   All common shareowners, whose shares are registered in their own names,
   automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
   Plan), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
   distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional common shares
   of the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
   Plan.

44   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/10
<PAGE>

   Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and capital
   gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary
   and may be terminated or resumed at any time without penalty by notifying
   American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent for shareowners in
   administering the Plan (the Plan Agent), in writing prior to any dividend
   record date; otherwise such termination or resumption will be effective with
   respect to any subsequently declared dividend or other distribution.

   If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
   other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate in
   the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not offer
   the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of record. A firm
   or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividend in common shares of the
   Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the plan.

   Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on common shares payable in cash,
   participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common shares
   acquired by the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued
   but authorized common shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of
   outstanding common shares on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on
   the payment date for any dividend the net asset value per common share is
   equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
   trading fees (market premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount
   in newly issued common shares. The number of newly issued common shares to be
   credited to each account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of
   the dividend by the net asset value per common share on the date the shares
   are issued, provided that the maximum discount from the then current market
   price per share on the date of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the
   payment date for any dividend, the net asset value per common share is
   greater than the market value (market discount), the Plan Agent will invest
   the dividend amount in common shares acquired in open-market purchases. There
   are no brokerage charges with respect to newly issued common shares. However,
   each participant will pay a pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred
   with respect to the Plan Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the
   Plan does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes
   which may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding
   Plan shares in a brokerage account may not be able to transfer the shares to
   another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

PIM, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A. (UniCredit),
manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the Trust's
Advisory Agreement with PIM are calculated daily at the annual rate of 0.70% of
the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets" means (a) the

                   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/10  45
<PAGE>

total assets of the Trust, including any form of investment leverage, minus (b)
all accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of operations, which
shall not include any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment
leverage obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without
limitation, borrowing through a credit facility of the issuance of debt
securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred stock or other similar preference
securities, and/or (iii) any other means. For the six months ended May 31,
2010, the net management fee was equivalent to 0.70% of the Trust's average
daily managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.13% of the Trust's average
daily net assets attributable to the common shareowners.

In addition, under PIM's management and administration agreements, certain
other services and costs are paid by PIM and reimbursed by the Trust. At May
31, 2010, $325,998 was payable to PIM related to management costs,
administrative costs and certain other reimbursements and is included in "Due
to affiliates" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

PIM has retained Princeton Administrators, LLC (Princeton) to provide certain
administrative and accounting services to the Trust on its behalf. PIM pays
Princeton a monthly fee at an annual rate equal to 0.07% of the Trust's average
daily managed assets up to $500 million and 0.03% for average daily managed
assets in excess of $500 million, subject to a minimum monthly fee of $10,000.
Princeton receives no compensation directly from the Trust. Effective September
30, 2010, Princeton has notified PIM that it will resign as administrators of
the Trust.

3. Transfer Agents

Pioneer Investment Management Shareholder Services, Inc. (PIMSS), a wholly
owned indirect subsidiary of UniCredit, through a sub-transfer agency agreement
with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, provides substantially all
transfer agent and shareowner services related to the Trust's common shares at
negotiated rates. Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (Deutsche Bank) is the
transfer agent, registrar, dividend paying agent and auction agent with respect
to the Trust's Auction Market Preferred Shares (AMPS). The Trust pays Deutsche
Bank an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust and Deutsche
Bank, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimburses PIMSS for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
PIMSS related to shareowner communications activities such as proxy and
statement mailings and outgoing phone calls.

5. Trust Shares

There are an unlimited number of common shares of beneficial interest
authorized.

Transactions in common shares of beneficial interest for the six months ended
May 31, 2010 and year ended November 30, 2009 were as follows:

Shares outstanding at end of period               24,466,483     24,428,148
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

The Trust may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of beneficial interest
into one or more series of preferred shares of beneficial interest. As of May
31, 2010, there were 7,298 AMPS as follows: Series M7-2,434, Series W7-2,432
and Series TH7-2,432.

Dividends on Series M7, Series W7 and Series TH7 are cumulative at a rate which
is to be reset every seven days based on the results of an auction. An auction
fails if there are more AMPS offered for sale than there are buyers. When an
auction fails, the dividend rate for the period will be the maximum rate on the
auction dates described in the prospectus for the AMPS. Preferred shareowners
will not be able to sell their AMPS at an auction if the auction fails. Since
February 2008, the Trust's auctions related to the AMPS have failed. The
maximum rate for each series is the greater of 125% of the one week LIBOR rate
or the LIBOR rate plus a spread of 1.25%. Dividend rates on AMPS ranged from
1.456% to 1.583% during the six months ended May 31, 2010.

                   Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/10  47
<PAGE>

The Trust may not declare dividends or make other distributions on its common
shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of the declaration,
distribution or purchase, the Trust does not comply with the asset coverage
ratios described in the prospectus for the AMPS.

The AMPS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, in whole or in part, on any
dividend payment date at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared. The AMPS are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $25,000 per share plus any accumulated or unpaid dividends,
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of the Trust as set forth in the Statement of
Preferences are not satisfied.

The holders of AMPS have voting rights equal to the holders of the Trust's
common shares (one vote per share) and will vote together with holders of the
common shares as a single class. Holders of AMPS are also entitled to elect two
of the Trust's Trustees. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, requires that along with approval by shareowners that might otherwise
be required, the approval of the holders of a majority of any outstanding
preferred shares, voting separately as a class, would be required to (a) adopt
any plan of reorganization that would adversely affect the preferred shares and
(b) take any action requiring a vote of security holders, including, among
other things, changes in the Trust's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in its fundamental investment restrictions.

6. Pending Litigation

The Trust is currently involved in a litigation matter relating to a Trust
investment. The Trust believes the claim is without merit and is defending it
vigorously. At May 31, 2010, it is reasonably possible that an adverse outcome
may result. Currently, the amount of any judgment cannot be reasonably
estimated.

7. Subsequent Events

Subsequent to May 31, 2010, the Board of Trustees of the Trust declared a
dividend from undistributed net investment income of $0.0725 per common share
payable June 30, 2010 to common shareowners of record on June 15, 2010.

Subsequent to May 31, 2010, dividends declared and paid on preferred shares
totaled $354,482 in aggregate for the three outstanding preferred share series
through July 22, 2010.

In preparing these financials statements, PIM has evaluated the impact of all
events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure, and has
determined that other than disclosed above, there were no subsequent events
requiring recognition or disclosure in the financials statements.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (unaudited)

During the period, there were no material changes in the Trust's investment
objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which has not been
approved by the shareowners. There have been no changes in the principle risk
factors associated with investment in the Trust.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, that the Trust may purchase, from time to
time, its common shares in the open market.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT POLICIES

Event-Linked Bonds

The Trust may invest in "event-linked" bonds, which sometimes are referred to
as "insurance-linked" or "catastrophe" bonds. Event-linked bonds are debt
obligations for which the return of principal and the payment of interest are
contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a
hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. For some event-linked
bonds, the trigger event's magnitude may be based on losses to a company or
industry, industry indexes or readings of scientific instruments rather than
specified actual losses. If a trigger event, as defined within the terms of an
event-linked bond, involves losses or other metrics exceeding a specific
magnitude in the geographic region and time period specified therein, the Trust
may lose a portion or all of its accrued interest and/or principal invested in
such event-linked bond. The Trust is entitled to receive principal and interest
payments so long as no trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude
specified by the instrument. Event-linked bonds may be issued by government
agencies, insurance companies, reinsurers, special purpose corporations or
other on-shore or off-shore entities. With respect to limitations on investment
outside of the U.S., the Trust will consider the region associated with the
event-linked risks as opposed to the off-shore domicile of any special purpose
issuer. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked bonds may
also expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
(credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
adverse tax consequences.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Pioneer Investment Management, Inc ("PIM"), the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service

  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of

similar functions, about the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-2(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-2(c))) based on their evaluation of these controls and procedures as of
a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the
disclosure required by this paragraph.

The registrant's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have

procedures as of a date within 90 days of the
filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose whether or not there were significant changes in the registrant's
internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these

reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.


ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(a) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the

(b) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2 under the Act
(17 CFR 270.30a-2).

Filed herewith.
