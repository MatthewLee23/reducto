             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE MEMBERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
     UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS FUND, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS Technology  Partners  Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund"),  including the
schedule of portfolio  investments,  as of December  31,  2007,  and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended,  the statements
of  changes in  members'  capital  for each of the two years in the period  then
ended,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the five years in the period
then  ended.  These  financial  statements  and  financial  highlights  are  the
responsibility  of the Fund's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  and financial  highlights  based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material  misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's  internal  control over  financial
reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the
effectiveness  of  the  Fund's  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.
Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and the disclosures in the financial
statements and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
investments in investment funds as of December 31, 2007, by correspondence  with
management of the underlying  investment  funds and others.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of UBS
Technology  Partners  Fund,  L.L.C.  at December  31,  2007,  the results of its
operations  and its cash  flows  for the year then  ended,  the  changes  in its
members'  capital  for each of the two years in the period  the  ended,  and the
financial  highlights  for each of the five years in the period then  ended,  in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


                                                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2007

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 1.  ORGANIZATION

     UBS Technology  Partners,  L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized as a
     limited partnership under the laws of Delaware on December 28, 1998 and was
     subsequently  reorganized as a limited  liability company effective October
     15, 2002. The Fund is registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
     as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,  non-diversified,  management
     investment company.  The Fund's investment objective is to maximize capital
     appreciation over the long-term.  The Fund pursues its investment objective
     by  deploying  its  assets  primarily  among a select  group  of  portfolio
     managers who invest primarily in, or who have particular  knowledge within,
     the technology  sector.  Generally,  such portfolio  managers conduct their
     investment programs through  unregistered  investment funds  (collectively,
     the  "Investment  Funds") in which the Fund invests as a limited partner or
     member along with other investors.  The Fund commenced  operations on April
     1, 1999.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall  responsibility
     to manage and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
     exclusive  authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
     management,  conduct and  operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
     have  engaged  UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "UBSFA" or  "Manager"),  a
     Delaware limited  liability company and the Manager of the Fund, to provide
     investment  advice  regarding the  selection of Investment  Funds and to be
     responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Manager is a direct  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,  Inc.,
     which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG,  and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Manager may  determine  and are  generally
     accepted monthly. The Fund reserves the right to reject any application for
     interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to
     written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors,  in their complete
     and  exclusive  discretion.  The Manager  expects that  generally,  it will
     recommend to the Directors that the Fund offer to repurchase interests from
     Members twice in each year,  near  mid-year and year-end.  Members can only
     transfer or assign their membership interests, or a portion thereof, (i) by
     operation  of  law  pursuant  to  the  death,  bankruptcy,   insolvency  or
     dissolution  of a  Member,  or  (ii)  with  the  written  approval  of  the
     Directors,  which may be  withheld in their sole and  absolute  discretion.
     Such  transfers  may be made even if the balance of the capital  account to
     such transferee is equal to or less than the  transferor's  initial capital
     contribution.

 2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
     Manager  as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
     accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set  forth  below or as may be
     determined  from  time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
     Directors.



                                                                               6

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2007

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     The Fund's  investments  in  Investment  Funds are subject to the terms and
     conditions of the respective  operating  agreements and offering memoranda,
     as appropriate.  The Fund's  investments in Investment Funds are carried at
     fair value as determined by the Fund's pro-rata  interest in the net assets
     of each  Investment  Fund. All  valuations  utilize  financial  information
     supplied by each  Investment Fund and are net of management and performance
     incentive fees or allocations  payable to the Investment Funds' managers or
     pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.   The  Fund's  valuation
     procedures  require  the  Manager  to  consider  all  relevant  information
     available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. The Manager and/or the
     Directors  will  consider  such  information  and  consider  whether  it is
     appropriate,  in  light of all  relevant  circumstances,  to  value  such a
     position  at its net asset  value as  reported  or whether  to adjust  such
     value. The underlying investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for
     at fair value as described in each Investment Fund's financial  statements.
     (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

     Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in the
     form of  cash or  securities,  are  first  applied  as a  reduction  of the
     investment's cost.

     B. INCOME RECOGNITION

     Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses
     from  Investment  Fund  transactions  are  calculated  on the cost recovery
     basis.

     C. FUND COSTS

     The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not
     limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
     and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value;  costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  offering and
     organization  costs; due diligence,  including travel and related expenses;
     expenses of meetings of Directors  and  Members;  all costs with respect to
     communications  to Members;  and other  types of  expenses  approved by the
     Directors. Offering costs are charged to capital as incurred.

     D. INCOME TAXES

     The Fund has  reclassified  $3,574,047 and $11,865,931 from accumulated net
     investment  loss  and  accumulated  net  realized  gain  from  investments,
     respectively,  to net capital  contributions during the year ended December
     31, 2007.  The  reclassification  was to reflect,  as an  adjustment to net
     capital contributions,  the amount of taxable income or loss that have been
     allocated to the Fund's Members and had no effect on net assets.

     In June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
     Interpretation  48 "Accounting  for  Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48).
     This  standard  defines  the  threshold  for  recognizing  the  benefits of
     tax-return positions in the financial statements as  "more-likely-than-not"
     to



                                                                               7

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2007

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     D. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

     be sustained by the taxing  authority  and  requires  measurement  of a tax
     position meeting the more-likely-than-not  criterion,  based on the largest
     benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized.  Management has
     analyzed the Fund's tax positions  taken on federal  income tax returns for
     all open tax years (tax years ended December 31, 2003-2006) for purposes of
     implementing  FIN 48, and has concluded that no provision for income tax is
     required in the Fund's financial  statements.  The fund recognizes interest
     and penalties,  if any,  related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax
     expense in the statement of operations. During the period, the fund did not
     incur any interest or penalties.

     Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return its
     distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
     account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
     accrued interest which is included in interest  receivable on the Statement
     of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

     F. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

     From  time to time  the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
     connection  with  such  transactions  it is  the  Fund's  policy  that  its
     Custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities, the fair
     value of which exceeds the principal amount of the repurchase  transaction,
     including accrued interest,  at all times. If the seller defaults,  and the
     fair value of the collateral declines, realization of the collateral by the
     Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of  December  31,  2007,  there were no
     outstanding repurchase agreements.

     G. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S.  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles requires the Manager to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
     and accompanying notes. The Manager believes that the estimates utilized in
     preparing  the Fund's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;
     however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

 3.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     UBSFA provides certain management and administrative  services to the Fund,
     including,  among other  things,  providing  office space and other support
     services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays UBSFA a monthly
     management fee (the "Management Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's
     net assets, excluding assets attributable to the Manager's capital account.
     The Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's  assets and debited  against the
     Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding the Manager's  capital  account.  A
     portion of the fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.



                                                                               8

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2007

 3.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
     Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
     compensation  from the Fund,  and bears its own costs  associated  with its
     activities  as  placement  agent.   Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
     contributions are debited against the contribution  amounts, to arrive at a
     net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute  assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase (or decrease) in members'  capital derived from operations
     (net income or loss) is initially  allocated to the capital accounts of all
     Members  on a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than  the Fee  which  is  similarly
     allocated  to all Members  other than the Manager as  described  above.  In
     accordance with the Limited  Liability  Company  Agreement,  the Manager is
     then  allocated  an  amount  based  on the  performance  of the  Fund  (the
     "Performance  Bonus")  for  the  Measurement  Period,  as  defined  in  the
     Confidential  Memorandum (i.e., the period commencing on the admission of a
     Member  to the Fund,  and  thereafter  each  period  commencing  on the day
     following the last Measurement  Period and ending generally on the first to
     occur of (1) a fiscal year-end or (2) a whole or partial  redemption).  The
     Performance Bonus is calculated separately with respect to each Member.

     The Performance Bonus is equal to 1% of the balance of the Member's capital
     account at the end of the Measurement Period, provided that appreciation in
     the Member's  capital  account (net of any  Performance  Bonus) exceeds the
     Member's threshold return. The threshold return is the amount that a Member
     would have earned for a fiscal year if it had received an  annualized  rate
     of return of 20% on its opening capital account  balance,  as adjusted.  No
     Performance Bonus was earned for the year ended December 31, 2007.

     Each Director of the Fund receives a retainer of $7,500 plus a fee for each
     meeting  attended.  All  Directors  are  reimbursed  by the  Fund  for  all
     reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed  by the Fund
     related to  Directors  for the year ended  December  31, 2007 were  $34,568
     which is included in other expense.

     Other investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
     may also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

 4.  ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

     PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as custodian (the
     "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial  services for the
     Fund.

     PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as  Administrator  and
     Accounting  Agent  to  the  Fund  and in  that  capacity  provides  certain
     administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax  and  investor  related
     services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee  primarily  based upon (i) the
     average net assets of the Fund,  subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii)

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2007

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 5.  LOAN PAYABLE

     Effective  July 1, 2007 the Fund,  along  with other UBS  sponsored  funds,
     renewed a $200,000,000  committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit with
     Bank of  Montreal - Chicago  Branch,  which is the  Illinois  branch of the
     parent  to Harris  Trust  and  Savings  Bank.  Under  the most  restrictive
     arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount  that  combined  with the other
     borrowings  of the Fund would not exceed 20% of its net assets.  The Fund's
     borrowing  capacity  is also  limited to the  portion of the unused line of
     credit  at any  point in time.  The Fund is only  liable  under the line of
     credit to the extent of its own borrowing there under. The interest rate on
     the  borrowing is based on the Federal Funds rate plus 150 basis points per
     annum.  The committed  facility also requires a fee to be paid by the Fund,
     on a pro-rata basis, based on the amount of the aggregate  commitment which
     has not been  utilized  of 25 basis  points per  annum.  For the year ended
     December 31, 2007, the Fund's average  interest rate paid on borrowings was
     6.75% per annum and the average  borrowings were $532,059.  The Fund has no
     borrowings  outstanding at December 31, 2007. Interest expense for the year
     ended  December 31, 2007 was $35,914.  The Fund has no interest  payable at
     December 31, 2007.

     On December 21, 2007 and December 27, 2007, the Fund,  along with other UBS
     sponsored  funds,  entered into the ninth amendment and the tenth amendment
     respectively  to  the  existing  credit  agreement.  These  two  amendments
     provided a  temporary  increase  in the credit  line from  $200,000,000  to
     $400,000,000  for the  period  commencing  January  4,  2008,  through  and
     including February 15, 2008.  Commencing February 16, 2008, the credit line
     reverts back to a $200,000,000 total unsecured facility which terminates on
     July 29, 2008.

 6.  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

     Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  Investment  Funds  for the year  ended
     December 31, 2007, amounted to $25,500,000 and $47,865,931, respectively.

     The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the  Investment  Funds.
     The  allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by the  Investment
     Funds on Schedule  K-1.  The Fund has not yet  received  all such  Schedule
     K-1's for the year ended December 31, 2007.

 7.  INVESTMENTS

     As of December 31, 2007, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none
     of which were related parties.

     The  agreements  related to  investments  in  Investment  Funds provide for
     compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of  management
     fees of 0.5% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance incentive fees
     or allocations of 20% of net profits earned.

 8.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
     contracts for differences, and equity



                                                                              10

 8.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK (CONTINUED)

     swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the
     value of these investments as reported by the Fund.

 9.  INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into  contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against  the Fund.
     Based on its history and  experience,  management  feels the  likelihood of
     such an event is remote.

10.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157 (FAS 157)

     On September 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial  Accounting
     Standards  No.  157  "Fair  Value   Measurements"   ("FAS  157").  FAS  157
     establishes an authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework
     for  measuring  fair  value,  and  requires  additional  disclosures  about
     fair-value measurements.  The application of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
     years  beginning  after November 15, 2007 and interim  periods within those
     fiscal years.  Management believes that the application of FAS 157 will not
     have a material impact on the Fund's financial statements.

     (a) Ratio of total  expenses  to average  net assets  does not  include the
         impact of expenses for incentive  allocations or incentive fees related
         to the underlying Investment Funds.

     (b) Total  return  assumes a  purchase  of an  interest  in the Fund at the
         beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund interest on the last day
         of the period  noted and does not reflect the  deduction  of  placement
         fees,  if any,  incurred  when  subscribing  to the Fund. An individual
         member's  ratios and return may vary from the above based on  incentive
         allocation, if applicable and the timing of capital transactions.

     (c) Total  return  assumes a  purchase  of an  interest  in the Fund at the
         beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund interest on the last day
         of the period noted,  after Performance Bonus to the Manager,  and does
         not reflect the  deduction of placement  fees,  if any,  incurred  when

     (d) The average net assets used in the above  ratios are  calculated  using
         pre-tender net assets.

                   UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C. (UNAUDITED)

         The Directors (including the Independent Directors) last evaluated the
Investment Advisory Agreement at a meeting on September 18, 2007. The Directors
met in an executive session during which they were advised by and had the
opportunity to discuss with independent legal counsel the approval of the
Investment Advisory Agreement. The Directors reviewed materials furnished by the
Adviser, including information regarding the Adviser, its affiliates and its
personnel, operations and financial condition. Tables indicating comparative fee
information, and comparative performance information, as well as a summary
financial analysis for the Fund, were also included in the meeting materials and
were reviewed and discussed. The Directors discussed with representatives of the
Adviser the Fund's operations and the Adviser's ability to provide advisory and
other services to the Fund.

         The Directors reviewed, among other things, the nature of the advisory
services to be provided to the Fund by the Adviser, including its investment
process, and the experience of the investment advisory and other personnel
proposing to provide services to the Fund. The Directors discussed the ability
of the Adviser to manage the Fund's investments in accordance with the Fund's
stated investment objectives and policies, as well as the services to be
provided by the Adviser to the Fund, including administrative and compliance
services, oversight of Fund accounting, marketing services, assistance in
meeting legal and regulatory requirements and other services necessary for the
operation of the Fund. The Directors acknowledged the Adviser's employment of
highly skilled investment professionals, research analysts and administrative,
legal and compliance staff members to ensure that a high level of quality in
compliance and administrative services would be provided to the Fund. The
Directors also recognized the benefits which the Fund derives from the resources
available to the Adviser and the Adviser's affiliates, including UBS AG and UBS
Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial"). Accordingly, the Directors felt that
the quality of service offered by the Adviser to the Fund was appropriate, and
that the Adviser's personnel had sufficient expertise to manage the Fund.

         The Directors reviewed the performance of the Fund and compared that
performance to the performance of another investment company presented by UBS
Financial which has objectives and strategies similar to those of the Fund and
is managed by another, third-party investment adviser (the "Comparable Fund").
The Directors observed that the Fund's performance significantly exceeded that
of its Comparable Fund, both since inception and for 2006, although it trailed
the performance of its Comparable Fund slightly for the first half of 2007. The
Directors also compared the volatility of the Fund to that of its Comparable
Fund. The Directors observed that the Fund's volatility was higher than the
volatility of its Comparable Fund.

         The Directors considered the fees being charged by the Adviser for its
services to the Fund as compared to those charged to the Comparable Fund, and as
compared to the management and incentive fees charged by UBS Fund Advisor,
L.L.C. ("UBSFA") and its affiliates for other UBS alternative investment
products. The information presented to the Directors showed that the management
fee being charged to the Fund was less than the management fee being charged to
its Comparable Fund, and the hurdle rate to be reached before incentive
allocations would be made was significantly below that of its Comparable Fund.
In comparing the management and incentive fees being charged to the Fund to the
fees being

<PAGE>

charged by UBSFA and its affiliates for other UBS alternative investment
products, the Directors observed that the management fee being charged to the
Fund was equal to the lowest management fee being charged to each of the
Alternative Investment Group's other multi-manager funds, and the Fund's
incentive fee was below the median incentive fee being charged such
multi-manager funds. In light of the foregoing, the Directors felt that the
combination of management fee and incentive fee being charged to the Fund was
appropriate.

         The Directors also considered the profitability of UBSFA both before
payment to brokers and after payment to brokers and concluded that the profits
to be realized by UBSFA and its affiliates under the Fund's Investment Advisory
Agreement and from other relationships between the Fund and UBSFA were within a
range the Directors considered reasonable and appropriate. The Directors also
discussed the fact that the Fund was not large enough at that time to support a
request for breakpoints due to economies of scale. The Directors determined that
the fees were reasonable. The Directors concluded that approval of the
Investment Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders.

         accountant's  engagements  for  audit  and  non-audit  services  to the
         registrant,  and certain non-audit  services to service Affiliates that
         are required to be pre-approved,  on a case-by-case basis. Pre-approval
         considerations  include  whether the proposed  services are  compatible
         with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

 (e)(2)  There were no services  described in each of paragraphs (b) through (d)
         of this Item that were  approved  by the audit  committee  pursuant  to
         paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C)  of Rule 2-01 of Regulation  S-X,  because such
         services were pre-approved.

    (f)  Not applicable.

    (h)  The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  has
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including  any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule
         2-01 of Regulation  S-X is compatible  with  maintaining  the principal
         accountant's independence.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.
                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A. INTRODUCTION

    UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. (the "Adviser") votes proxies for each fund (each a
"Fund," collectively, the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as such,
has adopted these Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies and
Procedures"). The Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in unregistered
investment vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other than the
Fund. Generally, each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets in
non-voting securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do not
submit matters to investors for vote; however, should a matter be submitted for
vote and provided the Fund holds voting interests in the Investment Fund, the
Adviser will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the
Fund and in accordance with these Policies and Procedures. The Board of
Directors (the "Board") of the Funds has adopted these Policies and Procedures
as the Funds'. The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's
Policies and Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

    Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process. The Adviser is under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize shareholder value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the Adviser's part to analyze the issues connected with the votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

    Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent with management's recommendations on routine matters, absent a
particular reason to the contrary. Non-routine matters will be voted on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.
<PAGE>

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

    Any circumstance or relationship which would compromise a portfolio
manager's objectivity in voting proxies in the best interest of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest. In such situations, the Adviser will
address any material conflicts before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy, the Adviser will presume the existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

    o    A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment Fund
         soliciting proxies or has communicated its view to the Adviser on an
         impending proxy vote;

    o    The portfolio manager responsible for proxy-voting has identified a
         personal interest in the Investment Fund soliciting proxies or in the
         outcome of a shareholder vote;

    o    Members of the portfolio management team, including the portfolio
         manager responsible for proxy-voting, and/or members of senior
         management, have a personal interest through investment in the
         Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

    o    Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in the
         outcome of a shareholder vote have attempted to influence either the
         Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.

    Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser, from employees' personal
relationships or special circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business. Employees who become aware of any such conflicts of
interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal who will work with appropriate personnel of the
Adviser to determine the materiality of the conflict.

    ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. A conflict of interest will be
considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances.

    If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the Adviser
may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict. The Adviser
shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified, the
materiality determination, and the method used to resolve the material conflict
of interest.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution before voting proxies affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

    o    Disclosing the conflict and obtaining consent before voting (which
         consent in the case of the Fund(s) may be obtained from the Fund's
         board of directors);

    o    Engaging another party on behalf of the Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
         its behalf;

    o    Engaging a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the proxy
         based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

    o    Such other method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances
         given the nature of the conflict.
<PAGE>

E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

    The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

    Where the Funds hold voting rights, the Funds shall include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge, upon request by taking the specified action; and
(iii) a statement that information regarding how the Adviser voted proxies
relating to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period, is available upon
request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

    To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a
fund's investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription document will be
reviewed to ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice.
In the event a fund does not waive voting rights, the Adviser will adhere to
these Policies and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

    The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting in
an easily accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the end
of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the
first two years on-site:

    o    A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

    o    A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

    o    A copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements) and
         related materials with regard to each vote;

    o    A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution of
         conflicts of interest;

    o    A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to a
         proxy -voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that
         decision; and

A copy of each written investor request for information on how the Adviser voted
proxies on behalf of the Fund(s), and a copy of any written response from the
Adviser to any (written or oral) investor request for information on how the
Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                         UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C.
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

The Fund is managed by a portfolio management team, each member of which (each,
a "Portfolio Manager" and together, the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio. Norman E. Sienko, Jr., the
lead member of the portfolio management team, is primarily responsible for the
selection of the Fund's investments, and is jointly responsible for the
allocation of the Fund's assets among Investment Funds. Russell Sinder and
Joseph M. Sciortino, the other members of the portfolio management team, are
jointly and primarily responsible for the allocation of the Fund's investments.

Mr. Sienko has served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception,
and as head of the Adviser's portfolio management group since 1998. He is also
currently an Executive Director of UBS Financial Services. Mr. Sinder has been a
Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception. Mr. Sinder has been
associated with the Adviser since 1998 and is also an Executive Director of UBS
Financial Services. Mr. Sciortino has been associated with the Fund since
December 2006 and joined the portfolio management team at that time. Mr.
Sciortino has been associated with the Adviser since 2006 and is also a Director
of UBS Financial Services. Previously, he served as Senior Analyst at Lake
Partners, Inc. from April 2001 though August 2006.

The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio Managers'
management of the Fund and other accounts. For example, conflicts of interest
may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of
limited investment opportunities. Allocations of investment opportunities
generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are
expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Conversely, a Portfolio
Manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem investments are placed. The Portfolio Managers may be
perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other
accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are managing on behalf of the
Adviser. In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio Managers' overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that differ
from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons, the Portfolio Managers may
purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts, and the
performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance
of the investments purchased for other accounts. The Portfolio Managers may
place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly
contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have the
potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

A potential conflict of interest may be perceived if the Adviser receives a
performance-based advisory fee as to one account but not another, because a
Portfolio Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether
or not the performance of that account directly determines the Portfolio
Manager's compensation.

The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its
clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly. The
Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage
and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address the
<PAGE>

conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with
Fund guidelines. Furthermore, senior investment and business personnel at UBS
Financial Services periodically review the performance of the Portfolio
Managers.

The Portfolio Managers' compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed salary
and a discretionary bonus paid by UBS Financial Services or its affiliates and
not by the Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid in shares of
stock or stock options of UBS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Adviser,
subject to certain vesting periods. The amount of a Portfolio Manager's
discretionary bonus, and the portion to be paid in shares or stock options of
UBS AG, is determined by senior officers of UBS Financial Services. In general,
the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination of factors, none of which
is necessarily weighted more than any other factor. These factors may include:
the overall performance of UBS Financial Services and its Alternative Investment
Group; the overall performance of UBS AG; the profitability to UBS Financial
Services derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts managed
by the Alternative Investment Group; the absolute performance of the Fund and
such other accounts for the preceding year; contributions by the Portfolio
Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative Investment Group; participation
by the Portfolio Manager in training of personnel; and support by the Portfolio
Manager generally to colleagues. The bonus is not based on a precise formula,
benchmark or other metric.

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by the
Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the shareholders

         required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls
         and  procedures  required by Rule  30a-3(b)  under the 1940 Act (17 CFR

         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR 270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the registrant's  second fiscal
         quarter  of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has  materially
