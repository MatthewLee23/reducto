The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund's investment objective is long-term capital
appreciation. To achieve its objective, the Fund invests in issuers that are
likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic, political, structural
and technological developments in the countries in the Caribbean Basin, which
include, among others, Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the
Dominican Republic, Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica,
Panama, Colombia, the United States and Venezuela ("Caribbean Basin Countries").
The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in equity and equity-linked
securities of issuers, including U.S.-based companies which engage in
substantial trade with, and derive substantial revenue from, operations in the
Caribbean Basin Countries.

February 4, 2008

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

We are pleased to present our semi-annual report for the period ended December
31, 2007. On that date, the net asset value of The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin
Fund, Inc. stood at $8.23 per share, a gain of 18.72% for the calendar year, and
a loss of 2.18% for the six month period, adjusted for the $1.28 per share
year-end stock distribution (unaudited). The Fund's large 98.51% premium to net
asset value at the end of 2006 inverted to a small discount of -2.43% by the
close of 2007. Accordingly, the share price declined 41.65% for the calendar
year, and 31.39% for the six months ended December 31, 2007, adjusted for the
$1.28 per share year-end stock distribution (unaudited).

Portfolio Commentary

Since I wrote to you last year, there have been a number of significant changes
in our portfolio. Florida East Coast Industries, for many years our largest
position, was taken over by Fortress Investment Group LLC, resulting in a very
substantial capital gain to the Fund. We also sold our holding of Florida Rock
Industries, which was our fifth largest position at this time last year, after a
takeover of that company was announced by Vulcan Materials Company. This, also,
was a very profitable sale for us.

The cash proceeds from the two transactions, combined with the money raised
through our October rights offering, was quite substantial and has allowed us to
make a more diversified reallocation of the portfolio.

Since December 31, 2007, we have added four companies to the portfolio,
including companies based in the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands and Puerto Rico.
These companies are still under accumulation.

We maintained relatively high cash positions throughout the fall of 2007, and
this level was increased by approximately $18 million from the proceeds of our
rights offering. Most of the markets where we are invested have been in a period
of decline since November. We therefore invested at a very measured pace; the
result was that our Fund's net asset value declined by less than the underlying
markets in which we hold positions. As the markets began to look especially
cheap in December and January, we became more aggressive in our buying, to the
point where we have currently become almost fully invested and we did so at what
we consider to be quite attractive prices. The result is that even though the
stock markets in the U.S. and Caribbean are down substantially year-to-date, our
net asset value is actually up a touch. As of the close on Friday, February 1,
2008, our net asset value stood at $8.28 per share (unaudited), versus $8.23 per
share on December 31, 2007 (unaudited).

================================================================================

Rights Offering

The Fund conducted a non-transferable rights offering during the period.
Stockholders of record September 26, 2007, were permitted to subscribe for one
additional share for each share held at a price equal to 85% of the average
volume-weighted closing share price on the expiration date of the offering and
four preceding trading days. The offering was completed on October 26, 2007, and
was fully subscribed. In my view, it was a very successful offering because it
allowed our existing stockholders to acquire new shares at a discount to the
market price; but at the same time, it was accretive to net asset value.
Stockholders who subscribed got a bargain, and those who chose not to
participate benefited from an increase in the net asset value per share. This
two-pronged beneficial result is quite unusual in the closed-end fund industry.

I'm pleased to report that officers and directors of the Fund acquired stock
through the offering. I personally purchased over $1 million worth of shares for
my own account. I'd like to thank the stockholders for their vote of confidence
and participation.

Although the share price is currently lower than the $10.04 per share price at
which the rights offering was completed, I believe this is the result of three
factors: 1) the Fund is trading ex- the year-end stock distribution of $1.28; 2)
the appearance of Fidel Castro on television with President Chavez of Venezuela
seems to indicate that he is still alive, although many in Miami find this hard
to believe; and 3) general doom and gloom in the equity markets have been
widespread in recent months.

As we have discussed in the past, in our view, the single most important
economic and political development in the Caribbean would be U.S. resumption of
trade with Cuba. The general belief is that the chances that the current embargo
with that country being eased or lifted would be greatly enhanced should there
be a new government there. Fidel Castro's health, therefore, bears directly on
this issue.

Year-End Distribution

Although we do not generally pay a dividend from net investment income, the Fund
has been able to pay nine capital gains distributions since its inception 15
years ago, including several large ones. For instance, in the past two years the
Fund has distributed $1.00 and $1.223 per share from long-term gains, and as of
December 31, 2007, the portfolio has about $0.85 of net unrealized appreciation
(unaudited).

Letter to Stockholders (continued)
================================================================================

Since inception our Board has elected to pay out these distributions; and the
payments have been welcomed by stockholders. In 2007 we declared the
distribution in stock rather than cash, at the suggestion of stockholders who
requested that we make it easier to reinvest their year-end distributions. We
expect to continue this policy.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Related Matters

The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January, 1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The Fund's investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The
Fund pursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked
securities of public and private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country or (ii) that have at least 50% of the value of their assets in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country (collectively, "Caribbean Basin
Companies"). Under normal conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its total
assets in equity and equity-linked securities of Caribbean Basin Companies. The
Fund's investment objective is fundamental and may not be changed without the
approval of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting securities.

At December 31, 2007, the Fund had foreign investments in companies operating
principally in Mexico and the Cayman Islands, representing approximately 17.77%
and 6.13% of the Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is State Street Bank and Trust Company
("SSBT"), 200 Clarendon Street, PO Box 9130, Boston, Massachusetts 02117.

Security Valuation

Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported
on the NASDAQ National Market or Capital Market) are stated at the last reported
sales price on the day of valuation (or at the NASDAQ official closing price);
other securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for
which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the last quoted bid price.
Restricted securities and other securities for which quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined by the Board of Directors.

In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements"
(SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals
and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Management is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on the Fund's
financial statement disclosures.

                                       -14-

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

In February, 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities -
including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159
permits entities to elect to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at
fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option
has been elected will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that
begins after November 15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact
the adoption of SFAS No. 159 wil have on the Fund's financial statements.

Income Recognition

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income
is recognized on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign
securities, as soon as the Fund is notified, and interest income is recognized
on an accrual basis. Pursuant to a custodian agreement, SSBT receives a fee
reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash balance
the Fund maintains with SSBT. Credit balances used to reduce the Fund's
custodian fees for the six months ended December 31, 2007, were approximately
$2,169. Discounts and premiums on debt securities purchased are amortized over
the life of the respective securities. It is the Fund's practice to include the
portion of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments denominated
in foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains and losses
on investments and foreign currency.

Deposits with Financial Institutions

The Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

Income Taxes

The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,
the Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no
federal tax provision is required.

 The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

Distributions to Stockholders

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. For the six months ended December 31, 2007, a
distribution from long-term capital gains of $1.223 per share and an income
distribution of $0.057 per share was declared on November 26, 2007, payable on
January 9, 2008 to shareholders of record December 12, 2007. The distribution
was paid in stock, unless an election to receive cash was made by the
stockholder. Shares were issued at a reinvestment price of $7.94 per share which
was equal to the net asset value of the common shares on the payable date of the
distribution, January 9, 2008.

NOTE 2. NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES OWNED

Investments in securities include $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic of
Cuba bonds purchased for $63,038. The bonds were listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and had been trading in default since 1960. A "regulatory halt" on
trading was imposed by the New York Stock Exchange in July, 1995 and trading in
the bonds was suspended as of December 28, 2006. The New York Stock Exchange has
stated that following the suspension of trading, application will be made to the
Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the issue. As of December 31, 2007,
the position was valued at $0 by the Board of Directors, which approximates the
bonds' fair value.

Investments in securities also include 45,000 shares of Xcelera, Inc. The
security traded on the Pink Sheets until the first quarter of 2007 when trading
was discontinued. As of December 31, 2007, the position was valued at $0 by the
Board of Directors, which approximates the position's fair value.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

HERZFELD / CUBA (the "Advisor"), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors,
Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual
rate of 1.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Total advisory fees for
the six months ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $152,003, of which $93,249
was payable as of December 31, 2007.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan
================================================================================

Registered holders ("Stockholders") of shares of common stock, $0.001 par value
("Common Stock") of Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") will
automatically be enrolled ("Participants") in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan (the "Plan") and are advised as follows:

 1.   State Street Bank & Trust Company (the "Agent") will act as agent for each
      Participant. The Agent will open an account for each registered
      shareholder as a Participant under the Plan in the same name in which such
      Participant's shares of Common Stock are registered.

 2.   CASH OPTION. Pursuant to the Fund's Plan, unless a holder of Common Stock
      otherwise elects, all dividend and capital gains distributions payable in
      cash ("Distributions") will be automatically reinvested by the Agent in
      additional Common Stock of the Fund. Stockholders who elect not to
      participate in the Plan will receive all cash distributions in cash paid
      by check mailed directly to the shareholder of record (or, if the shares
      are held in street or other nominee name then to such nominee) by the
      Agent, as dividend paying agent. Stockholders and Participants may elect
      not to participate in the Plan and to receive all cash distributions of
      dividends and capital gains in cash by sending written instructions to the
      Agent, as dividend paying agent, at the address set forth below.

 3.   MARKET PREMIUM ISSUANCES. If on the payment date for a Distribution, the
      net asset value per Common Stock is equal to or less than the market price
      per Common Stock plus estimated brokerage commissions, the Agent shall
      receive newly issued Common Stock ("Additional Common Stock") from the
      Fund for each Participant's account. The number of Additional Common Stock
      to be credited shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the
      Distribution by the greater of (i) the net asset value per Common Share on
      the payment date, or (ii) 95% of the market price per Common Share on the
      payment date.

4.    MARKET DISCOUNT PURCHASES. If the net asset value per Common Stock exceeds
      the market price plus estimated brokerage commissions on the payment date
      for a Distribution, the Agent (or a broker-dealer selected by the Agent)
      shall endeavor to apply the amount of such Distribution on each
      Participant's Common Stock to purchase Common Stock on the open market. In
      the event of a market discount on the payment date, the Agent will have 30
      days after the dividend payment date (the "last purchase date") to invest
      the dividend amount in shares acquired in open-market purchases. The
      weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all Common
      Stock purchased by the Agent as Agent shall be the price per Common Stock
      allocable to each Participant. If, before the Agent has completed its
      purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage commissions exceeds
      the net asset value of the Common Stock as of the payment date, the
      purchase price paid by Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Common
      Stock, resulting in the acquisition of fewer Common Stock than if such
      Distribution had been paid in Common Stock issued by the Fund. Because of
      the foregoing difficulty with respect to open-market purchases, the Plan
      provides that if the Plan Agent is unable to invest the full dividend
      amount in open-market purchases during the purchase period or if the
      market discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase period, the
      Plan Agent may cease making open-market purchases and may invest the
      uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued Common Stock at
      the net asset value per Common Stock at the close of business on the last
      purchase date. Participants should note that they will not be able to
      instruct the Agent to purchase Common Stock at a specific time or at a
      specific price. Open-market purchases may be made on any securities
      exchange where Common Stock are traded, in the over-the-counter market or
      in negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery
      and otherwise as the Agent shall determine. Each Participant's uninvested
      funds held by the Agent will not bear interest. The Agent shall have no
      liability in connection with any inability to purchase Common Stock within
      the time provided, or with the timing of any purchases effected. The Agent
      shall have no responsibility for the value of Common Stock acquired. The
      Agent may commingle Participants' funds to be used for open-market
      purchases of the Fund's shares and the price per share allocable to each
      Participant in connection with such purchases shall be the average price
      (including brokerage commissions and other related costs) of all Fund
      shares purchased by Agent. The rules and regulations of the Securities and
      Exchange Commission may require the Agent to limit the Agent's market
      purchases or temporarily cease making market purchases for Participants.

================================================================================

5.    The market price of Common Stock on a particular date shall be the last
      sales price on the securities exchange where the Common Stock are listed
      on that date (currently the NASDAQ Capital Market)(the "Exchange"), or, if
      there is no sale on the Exchange on that date, then the average between
      the closing bid and asked quotations on the Exchange on such date will be
      used. The net asset value per Common Stock on, a particular date shall be
      the amount calculated on that date (or if not calculated on such date, the
      amount most recently calculated) by or on behalf of the Fund.

6.    Whenever the Agent receives or purchases shares or fractional interests
      for a Participant's account, the Agent will send such Participant a
      notification of the transaction as soon as practicable. The Agent will
      hold such shares and fractional interests as such Participant's agent and
      may hold them in the Agent's name or the name of the Agent's nominee. The
      Agent will not send a Participant stock certificates for shares unless a
      Participants so requests in writing or unless a Participant's account is
      terminated as stated below. The Agent will vote any shares so held for a
      Participant in accordance with any proxy returned to the Fund by such
      Participant in respect of the shares of which such Participant is the
      record holder.

7.    There is presently no service charge for the Agent serving as
      Participants' agent and maintaining Participants' accounts. The Agent may,
      however, charge Participants for extra services performed at their
      request. The Plan may be amended in the future to impose a service charge.
      In acting as Participants' agent under the Plan, the Agent shall be liable
      only for acts, omissions, losses, damages or expenses caused by the
      Agent's willful misconduct or gross negligence. In addition, the Agent
      shall not be liable for any taxes, assessments or governmental charges
      which may be levied or assessed on any basis whatsoever in connection with
      the administration of the Plan.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (continued)
================================================================================

8.    The Agent may hold each Participant's Common Stock acquired pursuant to
      the Plan together with the Common Stock of other Stockholders of the Fund
      acquired pursuant to the Plan in non-certificated form in the Agent's name
      or that of the Agent's nominee. Each Participant will be sent a
      confirmation by the Agent of each acquisition made for his or her account
      as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 60 days, after the date
      thereof. Upon a Participant's request, the Agent will deliver to the
      Participant, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the full
      Common Stock. Although each Participant may from time to time have an
      undivided fractional interest in a Common Share of the Fund, no
      certificates for a fractional share will be issued. Similarly,
      Participants may request to sell a portion of the Common Stock held by the
      Agent in their Plan accounts by calling the Agent, writing to the Agent,
      or completing and returning the transaction form attached to each Plan
      statement. The Agent will sell such Common Stock through a broker-dealer
      selected by the Agent within 5 business days of receipt of the request.
      The sale price will equal the weighted average price of all Common Stock
      sold through the Plan on the day of the sale, less brokerage commissions.
      Participants should note that the Agent is unable to accept instructions
      to sell on a specific date or at a specific price. Any share dividends or
      split shares distributed by the Fund on Common Stock held by the Agent for
      Participants will be credited to their accounts. In the event that the
      Fund makes available to its Stockholders rights to purchase additional
      Common Stock, the Common Stock held for each Participant under the Plan
      will be added to other Common Stock held by the Participant in calculating
      the number of rights to be issued to each Participant.

      If a Participant holds more than one Common Stock Certificate registered
      in similar but not identical names or if more than one address is shown
      for a Participant on the Fund's records, all of such Participant's shares
      of Common Stock must be put into the same name and address if all of them
      are to be covered by one account. Additional shares subsequently acquired
      by a Participant otherwise than through the Plan will be covered by the
      Plan.

9.    The reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve Participants of any
      federal, state or local taxes which may be payable (or required to be
      withheld on Distributions.) Participants will receive tax information
      annually for their personal records and to help them prepare their federal
      income tax return. For further information as to tax consequences of
      participation in the Plan, Participants should consult with their own tax
      advisors.

10.   Each registered Participant may terminate his or her account under the
      Plan by notifying the Agent in writing at State Street Bank and Trust,
      P.O. Box 642, Boston, MA 02117-0642, or by calling the Agent at (617)
      937-6870. Such termination will be effective with respect to a particular
      Distribution if the Participant's notice is received by the Agent prior to
      such Distribution record date. The Plan may be terminated by the Agent or
      the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to each Participant at least 60
      days prior to the effective date of the termination. Upon any termination,
      the Agent will cause a certificate or certificates to be issued for the
      full shares held for each Participant under the Plan and cash adjustment
      for any fraction of a Common Share at the then current market value of the
      Common Shares to be delivered to him. If preferred, a Participant may
      request the sale of all of the Common Shares held by the Agent in his or
      her Plan account in order to terminate participation in the Plan. If any
      Participant elects in advance of such termination to have Agent sell part
      or all of his shares, Agent is authorized to deduct from the proceeds the
      brokerage commissions incurred for the transaction. If a Participant has
      terminated his or her participation in the Plan but continues to have
      Common Shares registered in his or her name, he or she may re-enroll in
      the Plan at any time by notifying the Agent in writing at the address
      above.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (continued)
================================================================================

11.   These terms and conditions may be amended by the Agent or the Fund at any
      time but, except when necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable
      law or the rules or policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission or
      any other regulatory authority, only by mailing to each Participant
      appropriate written notice at least 30 days prior to the effective date
      thereof. The amendment shall be deemed to be accepted by each Participant
      unless, prior to the effective date thereof, the Agent receives notice of
      the termination of the Participant's account under the Plan. Any such
      amendment may include an appointment by the Agent of a successor Agent,
      subject to the prior written approval of the successor Agent by the Fund.

12.   These terms and conditions shall be governed by the laws of the State of
      Maryland.

Discussion Regarding the Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement
================================================================================

The Fund's Board of Directors including a majority of those directors who are
not "interested persons" as such term is defined in the 1940 Act ("Independent
Directors") unanimously approved the continuance of the investment advisory
agreement between the Fund and the Advisor (the "Agreement") at a meeting held
on August 17, 2007.

Before meeting to determine whether to approve the Agreement, the Board had the
opportunity to review written materials provided by the Advisor and by legal
counsel to the Fund which contained information to help the Board evaluate the
Agreement. The materials included (i) a memorandum from the Fund's legal counsel
regarding the Directors' responsibilities in evaluating and approving the
Agreement, (ii) a letter from the Advisor containing detailed information about
the Advisor's services to the Fund, Fund performance, allocation of Fund
transactions, compliance and administration information, and the compensation
received by the Advisor from the Fund; (iii) a copy of the current investment
advisory agreement between the Fund and the Advisor; (iv) audited financial
statements for the Advisor for the year-ended December 31, 2006 and unaudited
financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2007; (v) the Advisor's
Form ADV Parts I and II; (vi) comparative performance data for the Fund relative
to peer funds (small closed-end funds and foreign funds invested in the Latin
American region); and (vii) comparative statistics and fee data for the Fund
relative to peer funds.

During its deliberations on whether to approve the continuance of the Agreement,
the Board considered many factors. The Board considered the nature, extent and
quality of the services to be provided by the Advisor and determined that such
services will meet the needs of the Fund and its shareholders. The Board
reviewed the services provided to the Fund by the Advisor as compared to
services provided by other advisors, which manage investment companies with
investment objectives, strategies and policies similar to those of the Fund. The
Board concluded that the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by
the Advisor were appropriate and consistent with the terms of the advisory
agreement, that the quality of those services had been consistent with industry
norms and that the Fund was likely to benefit from the continued provision of
those services. The Board also concluded that the Advisor had sufficient
personnel, with the appropriate education and experience, to serve the Fund
effectively and had demonstrated its continuing ability to attract and retain
qualified personnel.

Both at the meeting and on an ongoing basis throughout the year, the Board
considered and evaluated the investment performance of the Fund and reviewed the
Fund's performance relative to other investment companies and funds with similar
investment objectives, strategies and policies, and its respective benchmark
index. The Board considered both the short-term and long-term performance of the
Fund. They concluded that the performance of the Fund was within an acceptable
range of performance relative to other funds with similar investment objectives,
strategies and policies.

<PAGE>

Discussion Regarding the Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement
(continued)
================================================================================

The Board considered the costs of the services provided by the Advisor, the
compensation and benefits received by the Advisor providing services to the
Fund, as well as the Advisor's profitability. In addition, the Board considered
any direct or indirect revenues received by affiliates of the Advisor including
the commissions paid to the Fund's affiliated broker/dealer, Thomas J. Herzfeld
& Co., Inc. The Board considered the advisory fees paid to the Advisor by the
Fund and relevant comparable fee data and statistics of a sampling of small
closed-end funds and foreign funds invested in the Latin American region. The
Board further discussed the services by the Advisor and concluded that the
advisory services performed were efficient and satisfactory and that the fee
charged was reasonable and not excessive. The Board concluded that the Advisor's
fees and profits derived from its relationship with the Fund in light of its
expenses, were reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services
provided, taking into account the fees charged by other advisors for managing
comparable funds with similar strategies. The Directors also concluded that the
overall expense ratio of the Fund was reasonable, taking into account the size
of the Fund, the quality of services provided by the Advisor, and the investment
performance of the Fund.

The Board also considered the extent to which economies of scale would be
realized relative to fee levels as the Fund grows, and whether the advisory fee
levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of shareholders. The
Board recognized that because of the closed-end structure of the Fund, and the
fact that there is no influx of capital, this particular factor is less relevant
to the Fund than it would be to an open-end fund. The Board concluded that only
marginal economies of scale could be achieved through the growth of assets since
the Fund is closed-ended.

The Board also considered its deliberations regarding the Advisor's services and
performance from the regular Board meetings held throughout the year, including
the Board's discussion of the Fund's investment objective, long-term
performance, investment style and process. The Board noted the high level of
diligence with which it reviews and evaluates the Advisor throughout the year
and the extensive information provided with respect to Advisor's performance and
the Fund's expenses on a quarterly basis. The Board also considered whether
there have occurred any events that would constitute a reason not to renew the
Agreement and concluded there were not.

After deliberation and further consideration of the factors discussed above and
information presented at the August 17, 2007 meeting and at previous meetings of
the Board, the Board and the Independent Directors determined to continue the
Agreement for an additional one-year period. In arriving at this decision, the
Board and the Independent Directors did not identify any single matter, factor
or consideration as controlling, but made their determination in light of all
the circumstances. The Board based its decision to approve the Agreement on all
the relevant factors in light of its reasonable business judgment, and with a
view to future long-term considerations.
