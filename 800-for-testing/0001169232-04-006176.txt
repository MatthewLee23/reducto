TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

We are happy to present to you our report for the year ended October 31, 2004,
which we believe contains complete and pertinent financial information.

We are pleased to inform you that over the past fiscal year BMC Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") is up 10%. The Fund's strong performance reinforces the Board's
long-term strategy to remain well diversified across asset categories. For the
latest fiscal year, net assets, which included unrealized gains, increased by
$14,287,788. We should not expect comparable earnings during the year which will
end October 31, 2005, as markets are volatile; however, we are reasonably
optimistic that barring an unexpected national or international event the
financial markets will continue to improve.

It should be noted that the United States ("US") bond market produced relatively
strong gains for the three-month period ended September 30, 2004. In spite of
rising short-term rates, bond yields actually fell, resulting in higher bond
prices. The Lehman Brothers Aggregate Index, a good proxy for the fixed income
market, was up 3.2% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2004.

During the same three-month period ended September 30, 2004, US stock markets
struggled. Higher oil prices and concerns over the upcoming election kept the
pressure on the broader market. After falling as much as 6% over the summer, the
S&P 500 recovered somewhat to end down 1.9%.

Within this environment, the combined Fund portfolio provided a positive return
of 1.3% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2004. For the twelve
months ended September 30, 2004, the Fund's combined portfolio provided a total
return of 14.1%, compared to 13.9% for the S&P 500 and 3.7% for the Lehman
Brothers Aggregate Index.

It is important to note that although the benchmark comparisons shown above are
helpful, they do not take into account the diversified nature of the Fund. The
long-term goal is not to beat the market but to produce an income for
shareholders of 4.5% while at the same time growing the asset base to maintain
"real value," or after inflation value of the Fund. To accomplish this, the Fund
is well diversified among stocks, bonds and real estate.

As indicated in the accompanying pie charts included on page 4, there have been
no major shifts in the allocation of the Fund's assets over the last quarter of
the Fund's fiscal year. Given the current investment climate, the investment
team continues to be comfortable with the Fund's asset allocation.

In the short run, equities appear to be most attractive. The weak US dollar will
mean greater profits for exporters. Those multinational companies earning
profits in regions of the world with stronger currencies should see revenues
increase when profits are translated into US dollars. We believe that the
Federal Reserve Board will continue to gradually raise interest rates. For this
reason we are keeping bond maturities relatively short. In the high yield bond
sector, spreads are narrow by historical standards. So far, heavy supply has
been met by high demands from


                                       2
<PAGE>

investors looking for higher yields in a low interest rate environment.
Nevertheless, we are concerned about a possible shake out in this market. Since
corrections invariably follow periods where valuations are rich and where the
prospects for defaults are high, the Fund's portfolio managers will err on the
side of caution.

So long as interest rates continue to rise at a modest pace, and the current
high crude oil inventories remain stable, which should mean lower oil prices for
the time being, we believe the economic prospects look good for the immediate
future.

During the year ended October 31, 2004, the Fund paid the following dividends
per share:

      December 10, 2003 to shareholders of record November 25, 2003   $   .38
      March 10, 2004 to shareholders of record February 25, 2004          .25
      June 10, 2004 to shareholders of record May 25, 2004                .25
      September 10, 2004 to shareholders of record August 25, 2004        .25
                                                                      -------

      Total                                                           $  1.13
                                                                      =======

The Fund paid a dividend of $.71 per share on December 10, 2004 to shareholders
of record November 25, 2004.

Schedule I is a listing of the entire Fund's diversified securities at October
31, 2004, with a total market value of $133,339,921.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of BMC Fund, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of BMC
Fund, Inc. (the "Company"), including the schedules of investments, as of
October 31, 2004, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for the years ended October 31,
2004 and 2003, and the financial highlights for the years ended October 31, 2004
and 2003, the seven months ended October 31, 2002 and the years ended March 31,
2002 and 2001. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits. The financial highlights for each of the six years in the period ended
March 31, 2000 were audited by other auditors whose report dated May 19, 2000
expressed an unqualified opinion on the financial highlights for those six
years.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and the financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements for the years ended October 31, 2004
and 2003 and the financial highlights for the years ended October 31, 2004 and
2003, the seven months ended October 31, 2002 and the years ended March 31, 2002
and 2001 referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of BMC Fund, Inc. as of October 31, 2004, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for the years
ended October 31, 2004 and 2003, and the financial highlights for the years
ended October 31, 2004 and 2003, the seven months ended October 31, 2002 and the
years ended March 31, 2002 and 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Year Ended October 31, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Company") is a closed-end, diversified investment
      company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
      Prior to becoming a regulated investment company on April 1, 1981, BMC
      Fund, Inc. operated as a regular corporation. The following is a summary
      of significant accounting policies followed by the Company in the
      preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in conformity
      with generally accepted accounting principles for investment companies.

      A.    Investment Valuations - The investment securities are stated at
            market value as determined by closing prices on national securities
            exchanges. Investment securities include corporate bonds, mutual
            funds, and common and preferred stocks.

            The investments in limited partnerships, other investments and
            venture capital are stated at estimated fair value as determined by
            the management of these investments and are approved by the
            Company's Valuation Committee after giving consideration to
            historical and projected financial results, economic conditions,
            financial condition of investee and other factors and events subject
            to change. Because of the inherent uncertainty of those valuations,
            the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that
            would have been used had a ready market value for the securities
            existed, and these differences could be material.

            The carrying value of the investments in wholly owned subsidiaries
            is based on an independent appraisal of the fair market value of the
            subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of the wholly owned subsidiaries in
            the statement of operations represents the current year earnings of
            the subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method.

            The carrying value of the investment in real estate is based on an
            independent appraisal of the fair market value of the real estate.

      B.    Investment Transactions - Investment transactions are accounted for
            on the date the order to buy or sell is executed. Realized gains and
            losses on investments are determined on the basis of specific
            identification of issues sold or matured. The aggregate dollar
            amount of purchases and sales of investment securities, other than
            government securities and short-term debt securities having
            maturities of one year or less, for the year ended October 31, 2004,
            was $122,371,236.

      C.    Income Taxes - No federal tax provision is required as it is the
            Company's policy to comply with the provisions of Subchapter M of
            the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, including the
            distribution to its shareholders of substantially all of its income
            and any capital gains not offset by capital losses. Also, no state
            income tax provision has been provided because the states in which
            the Company has income recognize the tax exempt status of a
            regulated investment company.

1.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

      D.    Dividend Policy - It is the Company's policy to pay dividends during
            the year in sufficient amounts to meet the requirements to maintain
            its status as a regulated investment company.

      E.    Cash and Short-Term Investments - For purposes of financial
            reporting, the Company considers all investments at financial
            institutions with original maturities of three months or less to be
            equivalent to cash. Short-term money market investments managed by
            third party investors are included in investment securities.

      F.    Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in
            conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
            United States of America requires management to make estimates and
            assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
            liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
            the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
            revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
            could differ from those estimates.

2.    LINE OF CREDIT

      On September 25, 2000 (modified on October 20, 2000 and renewed July 21,
      2004), the Company entered into an agreement with a bank for an unsecured
      line of credit in the amount of $10,000,000 to provide the Company more
      flexibility in its payment of dividends and management of its investments.
      The interest rate on any borrowings will be at the LIBOR market index rate
      plus 125 basis points. No commitment fee is charged on any unused balance.
      As of October 31, 2004, the Company had borrowings of $1,700,000 from this
      line of credit, which expires on July 31, 2005.

3.    ADVISORY BOARD AND REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS

      The Company does not have an advisory board. The independent directors are
      paid an annual fee of $3,000 plus $1,000 for each meeting attended in
      person or $500 cash for each meeting attended by telephone. Each such
      independent director is paid an additional $1,000 for each day attending a
      committee meeting in person or $500 by telephone other than on the date of
      a board meeting. In addition, all directors are reimbursed for their
      reasonable expenses incurred in attending meetings.

Item 9.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

Corporate Governance Guidelines, members of the Board are expected
to collectively possess a broad range of skills, industry and other
knowledge and expertise, and business and other experience useful
for the effective oversight of the Fund's business.  The Nominating
Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending to the
Board qualified candidates for membership.  Candidates are evaluated
based on criteria established from time to time by the Board and the
criteria identified in the Corporate Governance Guidelines.  These
criteria include, but are not limited to:

- - Integrity, demonstrated sound business judgment and
high moral and ethical character;
- - Diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds, experiences and other
demographics;
- - Business or other relevant professional experience;
- - Capacity and desire to represent the balanced, best interests of
the Fund and its shareholders as a whole and not primarily a special
interest group or constituency;
- - Ability and willingness to devote time to the affairs and success
of the Fund and in fulfilling the responsibilities of a director; and
- - The extent to which the interplay of the candidate's expertise,
skills, knowledge and experience with that of other Board members
will build a Board that is effective, collegial and responsive to
the needs of the Fund.

The Nominating Committee is authorized to develop additional policies
regarding Board size, composition and member qualification.

The Nominating Committee evaluates suggestions concerning possible
candidates for election to the Board submitted to the Fund, including
those submitted by Board members and shareholders.  All candidates,
including those submitted by shareholders, will be similarly evaluated
by the Nominating Committee using the Board membership criteria described
above and in accordance with applicable procedures.  Once candidates
have been identified, the Nominating Committee will determine whether
such candidates meet the qualifications for director nominees
established in the Corporate Governance Guidelines or under applicable
laws, rules or regulations.  The Board, taking into consideration the
recommendations of the Nominating Committee, is responsible for selecting
the nominees for director and for appointing directors to fill vacancies.
The Nominating Committee has authority to retain and approve the
compensation of search firms to be used to identify director candidates.

As noted above, the Nominating Committee will consider qualified
director nominees recommended by shareholders when such recommendations
are submitted in accordance with applicable SEC requirements, the Fund's
bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines and any other applicable law,
rule or regulation regarding director nominations.  When submitting a
nomination to the Fund for consideration, a shareholder must provide
certain information that would be required under applicable SEC rules,
including the following minimum information for each director nominee:
full name, age and address; principal occupation during the past five years;
current directorships on publicly held companies and investment companies;
and number of shares of Fund common stock owned, if any.

Item 10.  Controls and Procedures.

Within the 90 days prior to the date of this report, the Registrant's
management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with
the participation of Registrant's Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 30a-2(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940.  Based upon the evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of a date within 90
days of the filing of this report that the Registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to
material information relating to the Registrant required to be included
in the Registrant's periodic SEC filings.

There were no significant changes in the Registrant's internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment
Company Act of 1940) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter
of the period covered by the report that have materially affected, or
are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrant's internal
control over financial reporting.

(a)(1)  The Registrant's Code of Ethics is attached as Exhibit 11(a)(1).

(a)(2)  A certification of each of the principal executive officer and

BMC Fund, Inc.
Form N-CSR
Item 4(e)(1) Exhibit


BMC FUND, INC.
AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICY

To preserve the independence of the auditing firm engaged to provide audit
services to BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Company"), the Audit Committee has established
the following policy:

1. It is the policy of the Audit Committee that any engagement of an independent
auditing firm to provide audit or non-audit services must be specifically
approved in advance by the Audit Committee in accordance with this Policy,
except as specifically provided in paragraph 3 below.

2. Consistent with this Policy, the Audit Committee must specifically approve in
advance the terms and conditions of and fees for each audit engagement, as well
as any changes in such terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in
audit scope, Company structure or other matters. The audit engagement letter may
include the provision of audit services, audit-related services and non-audit
services (such as review of the Company's tax returns), provided such non-audit
services are not prohibited by Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC").

3. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the independent auditors may provide, without
further pre-approval by the Audit Committee, (i) subject to the last sentence of
this paragraph, federal, state and local tax planning and advice, including but
not limited to advice regarding the calculation of the amount of dividends and
other distributions the Company is required to make in order to preserve its
status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code, and (ii) services relating to the preparation, printing, mailing
and filing of the Company's semi-annual report to shareholders as filed with the
SEC, provided the total fees for services rendered in accordance with this
paragraph 3 does not exceed $15,000 during any fiscal year. In no event may the
independent auditors be retained (A) in connection with a transaction initially
recommended by the independent auditors, the purpose of which may be tax
avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be supported by the Internal
Revenue Code, or (B) unless the separate pre-approval of the Audit Committee has
first been obtained, to provide tax advice concerning mergers or acquisitions,
restructurings, spin-offs or split-offs and other transactions that are not in
the ordinary course of business.

4. Management and the independent auditors will account for any service provided
by the independent auditors by the following categories in order to enable the
Company to satisfy its annual proxy statement disclosure obligations: Audit
Services, Audit-Related Services, Tax Services and Other Services.

5. Under no circumstances may the independent auditors perform any of the
following non-audit services:

* Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial
statements of the audit client*

* Financial information systems design and implementation*

* Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions or
contribution-in-kind reports*

* Actuarial services*

* Internal audit outsourcing services*

* Management functions

* Human resources

* Broker-dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services

* Legal services

* Expert services unrelated to the audit

The Audit Committee, the independent auditors and management should consult the
SEC's rules and relevant guidance to determine the precise definitions of these
services and the applicability to the Company of exceptions to certain of the
prohibitions. The list of prohibited services set forth above is not exclusive.
Prohibited services also include any service that would cause the auditors to
(i) function in the role of management, (ii) audit their own work or (iii) serve
in an advocacy role for the Company.

6. The independent auditors and the Chief Financial Officer or his or her
designee will (i) submit to the Audit Committee written requests or applications
for the independent auditors to provide services that require specific
pre-approval by the Audit Committee, including a joint statement as to whether,
in their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on
auditor independence, and (ii) inform the Audit Committee in writing, at least
annually, of each service performed by the independent auditors pursuant to the
general pre-approval by the Audit Committee in paragraph 3 of this Policy.

Adopted:  July 26, 2003
Revised:  January 31, 2004


* Unless it is reasonable to conclude that the results of these services will
not be subject to audit procedures during an audit of the audit client's
financial statements.

<DESCRIPTION>PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
<TEXT>
BMC Fund, Inc.
Form N-CSR
Item 7 Exhibit

BMC FUND, INC.
PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

BMC Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") invests in voting securities of a variety of
portfolio companies in order to achieve the Fund's investment objective of
providing a maximum level of income for shareholders consistent with maintaining
the Fund's long-term purchasing power. The Fund's Board of Directors, acting on
behalf of the Fund, has the right, and the obligation, to vote proxies relating
to the Fund's portfolio securities. The Board has delegated to the Investment
Committee and the Treasurer proxy voting authority, subject to the Board's
continuing oversight. In discharging this authority, the Investment Committee
and the Treasurer must act in a manner that is consistent with the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders.

The following policies will govern the Investment Committee's and the
Treasurer's voting of proxies relating to the Fund's portfolio securities:

General Policies

1. Delegation of Proxy Voting Decisions: The Fund will not delegate proxy voting
decisions to any third party, including its external investment advisers. Proxy
voting decisions will be made on behalf of the Fund by the Investment Committee
or the responsible internal portfolio manager of the Fund, or by the Treasurer
of the Fund in accordance with these Policies or the direction of the Investment
Committee or the internal portfolio manager. The Investment Committee or
Treasurer may consider, to the extent deemed appropriate, recommendations of
nationally recognized institutional shareholder representative groups, such as
Institutional Shareholder Services, in determining how to vote proxies or how to
instruct the Treasurer to vote proxies.

The Investment Committee will instruct the Treasurer how to vote proxies with
respect to securities acquired on behalf of the Fund by an external investment
adviser without consultation with such adviser. The responsible internal
portfolio manager or the Investment Committee (after consultation with the
responsible internal portfolio manager) will instruct the Treasurer how to vote
proxies with respect to securities acquired on behalf of the Fund.
Notwithstanding the above, the Treasurer may vote proxies in favor of the
recommendation of the board of directors of a portfolio company with respect to
the election of directors and the appointment or ratification of auditors
without specific instruction from the Investment Committee.

2. Matters Affecting Shareholder Rights. If a portfolio company submits to its
shareholders a matter that, in the view of the Investment Committee or the
responsible internal portfolio manager, adversely affects the rights of the
portfolio company's shareholders as a whole, the Investment Committee or the
internal portfolio manager will cause the proxy to be voted against the
proposal. If the Fund's ownership of the portfolio securities represents more
than five percent of the portfolio company's outstanding voting securities, the
Investment Committee or responsible internal portfolio manager will notify the
portfolio company's management of the Fund's opposition to the proposal and
encourage the portfolio company to withdraw the proposal.

3. Consideration of Views of Management of Portfolio Company. Except as
otherwise provided in these Policies, in considering how to vote a proxy
relating to a portfolio security, the Investment Committee or the responsible
internal portfolio manager will generally defer to the views of management of
the portfolio company if the portfolio security has performed in accordance with
the Fund's expectations (taking into account not only the performance of the
portfolio company but also industry and economic factors over which the
portfolio company has no control).

4. Conflicts with Affiliated Persons. If a matter submitted to a vote of the
shareholders of a portfolio company presents a conflict between the interests of
the Fund's shareholders and the interests of any affiliated person or investment
adviser of the Fund, the Investment Committee or the responsible internal
portfolio manager will cause the proxy relating to the portfolio security to be
voted in accordance with the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders as
a whole, without consideration of the interests of the affiliated person or
investment adviser. If the affiliated person of the Fund whose interests
conflict with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders is a member of the
Investment Committee or is an internal portfolio manager, such person will
recuse himself or herself from consideration of the matter.

5. General Principle: The most important factor to be considered by the
Investment Committee and internal portfolio managers in evaluating how to vote
proxies relating to portfolio securities is the financial impact of the matter
on the Fund's investment. The Investment Committee and the internal portfolio
managers may also take into account non-financial considerations, including
those described in the Global Sullivan Principles of Corporate Social
Responsibility, but such factors are secondary to financial considerations.

Specific Policies

The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will cause a proxy to be voted against, or
cause the Fund's authority to vote in favor to be withheld, for the following
issues when submitted to a shareholder vote:

1. Classified Boards. The Fund believes that it is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders for portfolio companies to be able to elect a full
slate of directors at each annual meeting.

2. Dual Class Capitalization. The Fund believes that it is in the best interests
of the Fund and its shareholders for portfolio companies to oppose capital
structures that diminish the rights of the Fund's voting shares.

3. Golden Parachutes. The Fund believes that it is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to oppose proposals that would grant
excessive awards to employees in the event of termination of employment
following a change in control.

4. Blank Check Preferred Stock. The Fund believes that it is in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to oppose blank check
preferred stock proposals, because this type of preferred stock gives the
company's board of directors discretionary authority over voting, conversion,
dividend and other rights at the time the stock is issued and is susceptible to
abuse. The Fund might vote in favor of this provision if the company's board
provides assurances that this provision would not be used without advance
shareholder approval in a change in control situation or that the voting rights
of a series of preferred stock are limited to one vote per share.

5. Re-pricing of Outstanding Options. The Fund believes that it is in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders for the Fund to oppose excessive
re-pricing of outstanding options for officers and directors, because doing so
usually would be inconsistent with the incentive nature of the stock option plan
as originally adopted and could result in unfair dilution of the Fund's
investment in the company.

6. Supermajority Voting. The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will vote against
supermajority voting provisions because the Fund believes that a simple majority
provides shareholders with a better means to effect change.

The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will vote for the following issues when
submitted to a shareholder vote:

1. Adoption or Extension of Shareholder Rights Plans. The Treasurer, on behalf
of the Fund, will vote for shareholder rights plans if shareholders are given
the opportunity to vote on the plan and the plan is subject to a limited term
and is tied to an overall corporate strategy.

2. Stock-based Compensation Plans. The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will
vote for stock-based compensation plans because the Fund believes in providing
appropriate equity incentives to corporate employees for increasing shareholder
value. The Treasurer will analyze each plan approval or plan amendment to be
sure that the stock-related compensation plan aligns the interests of corporate
management with those of the shareholders.

3. Increases in Authorized Common Stock. The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund,
will vote for increases in authorized common stock as long as the increase is
reasonable under the circumstances.

4. Confidential Voting. The Treasurer, on behalf of the Fund, will vote for
confidential voting proposals because the Fund believes that shareholders should
have the right to vote in private, thus enabling them to maintain their
independence and, in the case of employee shareholders, to vote without fear of
retribution.

Disclosure of Voting Policies

These Policies are available to shareholders of the Fund without charge, upon
request, by calling the Secretary of the Fund (collect at 828-758-6100,
extension 22). The Fund will mail a copy of these Policies by first class mail
to any shareholder requesting a copy within three business days after the
request is made. The Policies will also be available on the Securities and
Exchange Commission's website (http://www.sec.gov).

<DESCRIPTION>CODE OF ETHICS
<TEXT>
BMC Fund, Inc.
Form N-CSR
Exhibit 11(a)(1)

CODE OF ETHICS FOR
SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
OF BMC FUND, INC.

This Code of Ethics applies to the chief executive officer, chief financial
officer, and principal accounting officer or controller (individually, a "Senior
Financial Officer" and collectively, the "Senior Financial Officers") of BMC
Fund, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the "Company"). Its purpose is to
promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with the law, particularly as
related to the maintenance of the Company's financial records and the
preparation of financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The obligations of this Code of Ethics supplement, but do not
replace, the Company's Code of Ethics applicable to all Access Persons.

1. Senior Financial Officers are expected to carry out their responsibilities
honestly and with integrity, exercising at all times their best independent
judgment.

2. Senior Financial Officers must avoid situations in which their own interests
conflict, or may appear to conflict, with the interests of the Company. A
conflict situation can arise when a Senior Financial Officer takes actions or
has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively
and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise when a Senior Financial
Officer, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his or her position in the Company. In any case in which a Senior
Financial Officer finds himself or herself with an actual or apparent material
conflict of interest, he or she must promptly disclose it to the Chairman of the
Audit Committee so that the Audit Committee may review the transaction or
relationship. The Audit Committee will have final authority to determine how the
situation should be resolved. In furtherance of the above, no Senior Financial
Officer may:

(a) Work for, or receive payments for services or accept gifts of more than a
nominal value from, any investment adviser or other provider of services to the
Company or from any of the Company's portfolio companies.

(b) Serve on the board of directors or a similar body for an outside company or
government agency, other than a non-profit or community organization, without
the approval of the Audit Committee.

(c) Provide a gift to any person or entity that would violate any law.

3. Senior Financial Officers are responsible for assuring full, fair, accurate,
timely and understandable disclosure of relevant financial information to
shareholders and investors. In particular they are responsible for assuring that
the Company complies with SEC rules governing disclosure of financial
information. Among other things, Senior Financial Officers shall:

(a) Establish and maintain internal controls and procedures and disclosure
controls and procedures designed to assure that financial information is
recorded, processed and transmitted to those responsible for preparing periodic
reports and other public communications containing financial information so that
they are complete, accurate, and timely.

(b) Oversee the appropriate personnel to help ensure that the internal controls
and procedures and disclosure controls and procedures are being followed.

(c) Carefully review each periodic report for accuracy and completeness before
it is filed with the SEC and carefully review each public communication
containing financial information before it is released.

(d) Promptly disclose to the Audit Committee and the Company's independent
auditors any material weaknesses in, or concerns regarding, the Company's
disclosure controls or internal controls.

(e) Never create or maintain secret or unrecorded funds, assets, or accounts, or
intentionally make a payment or approve an invoice, expense report or other
document that is incorrect, misleading or inaccurate.

(f) Comply at all times with applicable governmental laws, rules and
regulations.

4. Senior Financial Officers are responsible for promptly bringing to the
attention of the Audit Committee or the full Board of Directors:

(a) Any matters that could compromise the integrity of the Company's financial
reports;

(b) Any disagreement with respect to any material accounting matter; and

(c) Any violation of this Code of Ethics or of any law or regulation related to
the Company's accounting or financial affairs.

5. No Senior Financial Officer may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass,
or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and
conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the employee (1) to
provide information, cause information to be provided or otherwise assist in an
investigation regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes
constitutes a violation of law, including any rule or regulation of the SEC, or
any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders; (2) to
file, cause to be filed, testify, participate in, or otherwise assist in a
proceeding filed or about to be filed (with any knowledge of the employer)
relating to an alleged violation of law, including any rule or regulation of the
SEC, or any provision of federal law relating to fraud against shareholders; or
(3) to make any report pursuant to the Company's Procedures for Reporting
Complaints About Accounting and Auditing Matters.

6. The Audit Committee shall approve any waiver or amendment of this Code of
Ethics, and any such waiver or amendment shall be disclosed promptly, as
required by law or SEC regulation.

7. A failure by any Senior Financial Officer to comply with the laws or
regulations governing the Company's business, this Code of Ethics or any other
Company policy or requirement may result in disciplinary action, including
termination, and, if warranted, legal proceedings. The Audit Committee will
investigate violations and appropriate action will be taken in the event of any
violations of this Code of Ethics.
