             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Members of
J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital, and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
J.P. Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") at March 31, 2007, the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the
changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in the period then
ended and the financial highlights for each of the two years in the period then
ended and for the period August 1, 2004 (commencement of operations) through
March 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These financial statements and financial
highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of investments at March 31, 2007 by correspondence with the
investment funds, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2007 (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was organized as a limited
liability  company on April 6, 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware  and
is registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"),  as a
closed-end,   non-diversified,   management   investment  company.   The  Fund's
investment  objective is to generate  consistent  capital  appreciation over the
long term, with relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional
equity and fixed-income markets. The Fund will seek to accomplish this objective
by allocating its assets  primarily  among  professionally  selected  investment
funds  ("Investment   Funds")  that  are  managed  by  experienced   third-party
investment  advisers  ("Portfolio  Managers") who invest in a variety of markets
and employ, as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies.

J.P. Morgan  Alternative Asset Management,  Inc. (the "Investment  Manager"),  a
corporation  formed  under the laws of the State of Delaware and an affiliate of
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ("J.P. Morgan Chase"), is responsible for the allocation
of assets to various Investment Funds,  subject to policies adopted by the Board
of Directors (the "Board").  Ehrlich  Associates,  L.L.C.,  a limited  liability
company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Managing  Member"),
serves as the managing  member of the Fund. The Managing Member is registered as
a commodity pool operator with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").

CMRCC, Inc., a corporation formed under the laws of the State of New York and an
affiliate  of the  Investment  Manager,  is the special  member of the Fund (the
"Special  Member").  The  Special  Member  is  entitled  to all  incentive-based
performance allocations, if any from Members' accounts.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted  in the United  States of America  requires  the  Investment
Manager to make estimates and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in
the financial  statements and  accompanying  notes.  Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset  value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
Investment  Manager as of the last business day of each month in accordance with
the valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be determined  from time to
time pursuant to policies  established by the Board.  The Fund's  investments in
the  Investment  Funds are  considered  to be illiquid  and can only be redeemed
periodically.  The  Board has  approved  procedures  pursuant  to which the Fund
values its  investments in Investment  Funds at fair value.  In accordance  with
these  procedures,  fair  value as of each  month-end  ordinarily  is the  value
determined as of such month-end for each  Investment Fund in accordance with the
Investment  Fund's  valuation  policies  and  reported at the time of the Fund's
valuation.

Notes to Financial Statements March 31, 2007 (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund
represents the amount that the Fund could  reasonably  expect to receive from an
Investment  Fund  if the  Fund's  interest  were  redeemed  at the  time  of the
valuation,  based on information  reasonably available at the time the valuation
is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. In the unlikely event that an
Investment Fund does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis,
the Fund would  determine  the fair value of such  Investment  Fund based on the
most recent value  reported by the  Investment  Fund, as well any other relevant
information  available  at the time the Fund  values its  portfolio.  The values
assigned to these  investments  are based on  available  information  and do not
necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized, as such amounts
depend on future  circumstances  and cannot  reasonably be determined  until the
individual investments are actually liquidated. However, because of the inherent
uncertainty of valuation,  those estimated values may differ  significantly from
the  values  that would  have been used had a ready  market for the  investments
existed, and the differences could be significant.

Investments  in  Investment  Funds  with  a  value  of  $153,483,882,  which  is
approximately  97.5% of the Fund's  net assets at March 31,  2007 have been fair
valued and are illiquid and restricted as to resale or transfer.

Some of the  Investment  Funds may invest  all or a portion  of their  assets in
investments  which  may be  illiquid.  Some of  these  investments  are  held in
so-called "side pockets",  sub funds within the Investment Funds,  which provide
for their separate  liquidation  potentially  over a much longer period than the
liquidity an investment  in the  Investment  Funds may provide.  Should the Fund
seek  to  liquidate  its  investment  in  an  Investment  Fund  which  maintains
investments in a side pocket arrangement or which holds substantially all of its
assets in illiquid securities, the Fund might not be able to fully liquidate its
investment without delay, which could be considerable. In such cases, during the
period  until the Fund is  permitted  to fully  liquidate  its  interest  in the
Investment Funds, the value of its investment could fluctuate.

C. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received,  whether in the form of cash or securities,  are applied
as a reduction of the  investment's  cost when identified by the Investment Fund
as a return of capital.  Once the  investment's  cost is  received,  any further
distributions are recognized as realized gains.

D. INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.  Dividend income is recorded on
the   ex-dividend   date.   Realized  gains  and  losses  from  Investment  Fund
transactions  are  calculated  on the  identified  cost basis.  Investments  are
recorded on the effective date of the  subscription in the Investment  Fund. All
changes  in the  value  of the  Investment  Funds  are  included  as  unrealized
appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of Operations.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business  other than those that the
Investment  Manager  assumes.  The  expenses  of the Fund  include,  but are not
limited  to,  the  following:  all  costs and  expenses  related  to  investment
transactions  and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting and
auditing fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; expenses of meetings of the Board and
Members; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and other types of
expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a  partnership  for
Federal  income tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for the  payment of
Federal,  state  or local  income  taxes  has  been  provided.  Each  Member  is
individually  required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of
the Fund's taxable income or loss.

G. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No.
48,  "Accounting  for  Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an  Interpretation  of FASB
Statement No. 109" (the  "Interpretation").  The Interpretation  establishes for
all  entities,  including  pass-through  entities  such as the  Fund,  a minimum
threshold for financial statement  recognition of the benefit of positions taken
in filing tax returns  (including  whether an entity is taxable in a  particular
jurisdiction), and requires certain expanded tax disclosures. The Interpretation
is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 2006, and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the date of  effectiveness.  Management  has
recently begun to evaluate the  application of the  Interpretation  to the Fund,
and is not in a  position  at this  time to  estimate  the  significance  of its
impact, if any, on the Fund's financial statements.

On December 22, 2006, the Securities and Exchange  Commission  announced that it
would  not  object  if a fund  implements  the  Interpretation  in its net asset
calculation  as late as its last net asset  calculation  in the  first  required
financial  statement  reporting  period  for its  fiscal  year  beginning  after
December  31, 2006.  Consequently,  the Fund will be required to comply with the
Interpretation by September 30, 2007.

In September 2006, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards  ("SFAS") 157, Fair Value  Measurements,  which
clarifies the  definition  of fair value and requires  companies to expand their
disclosure  about the use of fair value to measure  assets  and  liabilities  in
interim and annual periods subsequent to initial  recognition.  Adoption of SFAS
157  requires  the use of the price that would be  received  to sell an asset or
paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly   transaction  between  market
participants  at the  measurement  date.  SFAS 157 is  effective  for  financial
statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after  November  15,  2007,  and
interim  periods  within those fiscal  years.  At this time,  the Fund is in the

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

H. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies on deposit at PNC Bank, N.A.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Investment  Manager provides  advisory and other services.  In consideration
for such  management  services,  the Fund pays the Investment  Manager a monthly
management fee equal to 0.1042% (approximately 1.25% on an annualized basis) and
an  additional  administrative  services  fee of 0.0125% per month  (0.15% on an
annualized basis) of end of month Members' Capital.

Prior to April 1, 2006 the Fund paid the Investment Manager a monthly management
fee  equal  to  0.125%  (1.50%  on  an  annualized   basis)  and  an  additional
administrative  services fee of 0.0125% per month (0.15% on an annualized basis)
of end of month Members' Capital.

The Fund and the Investment  Manager have entered into an Expense Limitation and
Reimbursement  Agreement  (the "Expense  Limitation  Agreement"),  dated May 26,
2004,  under which the  Investment  Manager will agree to waive its fees and, if
necessary,  reimburse  expenses in respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that
the  Agreement  is in place so that the  total  operating  expenses  of the Fund
(excluding interest,  brokerage commissions,  other transaction-related expenses
and any extraordinary  expenses of the Fund as well as any Incentive Allocation)
do not exceed  2.30% on an  annualized  basis of the Fund's net assets as of the
end of each  month.  Under the  Expense  Limitation  Agreement,  any  waivers or
reimbursements  made by the  Investment  Manager will be subject to repayment by
the Fund within three years of the end of the fiscal year in which the waiver or
reimbursement  is made,  provided that  repayment  does not result in the Fund's
aggregate  operating expenses exceeding the foregoing expense  limitations.  For
the year ended March 31, 2007, the Funds' operating  expenses did not exceed the
expense limitation.  The Fund did not reimburse the Investment Manager,  and the
Investment Manager did not pay for any expenses on the Fund's behalf.

The Fund has entered into an administration  agreement with PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC"),
whereby PFPC provides fund  accounting,  investor  services and transfer  agency
functions for the Fund. As  compensation  for services set forth herein that are
rendered by PFPC during the term of this Agreement, the Fund pays PFPC an annual
fee  ranging  from 0.035% to 0.075% of the Fund's  average  net  assets,  with a
minimum monthly fee of $6,250 for administration  and accounting,  an annual fee
of 0.015% of the Fund's average net assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $3,334
for regulatory administration services, and an annual fee for Member services of
$150 per Member, with a minimum monthly fee of $1,000. PFPC did not waive any of
its fees for the year ended March 31, 2007. Any  previously  waived fees by PFPC
are  recoverable  from the Fund if the agreement with PFPC is terminated  within
the first three years of the effective date of the agreement.

PFPC Trust Company  ("PFPC  Trust") serves as custodian of the Fund's assets and
provides custodial services to the Fund. As compensation for services,  the Fund
pays PFPC Trust an annual fee of 0.005% of the Fund's average gross assets, with
a minimum monthly fee of $795.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The  Independent  Directors  are each paid an annual  retainer  of $10,000  plus
reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in  consideration  for their  attendance  at
meetings of the Board, and any committees  thereof,  and other services they may
provide to the Fund.

4. LINE OF CREDIT

From time to time,  the Fund may borrow  cash from a major  institution  under a
credit  agreement  up to a maximum  of $8  million.  Interest  is payable on any
outstanding  balance at PRIME plus  Margin  (0%) or LIBOR plus  Margin  (0.85%).
During the year ended March 31, 2007,  interest  expense on such  borrowings was
$10,049,  of  which  $9,255  was  payable  as of March  31,  2007.  The  average
outstanding line of credit balance for the 39 days outstanding during the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2007 was  $1,582,051.  The  average  interest  paid on such
borrowing was 6.07%.  Credit facility fees incurred for the year ended March 31,
2007 amounted to $14,322.

5. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate  purchases and sales of Investment  Funds for the year ended March 31,
2007 amounted to $74,962,276 and $52,028,372 respectively.

At March 31, 2007,  the estimated  cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax
purposes  was  substantially  the  same  as the  cost  for  financial  reporting
purposes.   Accordingly,   gross  unrealized  appreciation  on  investments  was
$53,439,341 and gross  unrealized  depreciation on investments was  $29,579,730,
resulting in net unrealized appreciation on investments of $23,859,611.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION

Generally,  initial  and  additional  subscription  for  interests  by  eligible
investors  may be  accepted  at such times as the Fund may  determine.  The Fund
reserves the right to reject any  subscriptions  for interests in the Fund.  The
initial  acceptance  for  subscriptions  for  Interests  was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial  Closing  Date").  After the Initial  Closing Date,  the Fund generally
accepts subscriptions for interests as of the first day of each month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
tenders by members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times, and in such
amounts,  and on such  terms  as may be  determined  by the  Board,  in its sole
discretion.  The Investment  Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase  Interests from members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets quarterly, effective as of the last day of
March, June, September,  and December. A 1.5% repurchase fee payable to the Fund
will be charged for  repurchases of Members'  Interests at any time prior to the
day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of a Member's purchase of its
Interests. For the year ended March 31, 2007, the fund charged Members' $100,879
in  repurchase  fees,  of which  $1,121 was  applied to the  remaining  Members'
capital accounts effective April 1, 2007.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

At the end of each Allocation  Period of the Fund, any net capital  appreciation
or net capital  depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized),  as the
case  may  be,  is  allocated  to the  capital  accounts  of all of the  Members
(including  the Special  Member and the Managing  Member) in proportion to their
respective  opening capital account  balances for such  Allocation  Period.  The
initial  "Allocation  Period"  began on the  Initial  Closing  Date,  with  each
subsequent  Allocation  Period  beginning  immediately  after  the  close of the
preceding Allocation Period. Each Allocation Period closes on the first to occur
of (1) the  last  day of each  month,  (2) the  date  immediately  prior  to the
effective  date of (a) the  admission  of a new Member or (b) an  increase  in a
Member's  capital  contribution,  (3) the  effective  date of any  repurchase of
Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

At the end of each calendar  year,  each Member's  return on investment  for the
year is determined  and a portion of the net capital  appreciation  allocated to
each Member's  capital account during the year (the  "Performance  Allocation"),
net of the  Member's  allocable  share  of the  Management  Fee and the  Manager
Administrative  Services  Fee,  equal to 10% of the  portion of such net capital
appreciation  that  exceeds  the  Preferred  Return (as  defined  below) will be
reallocated to the capital account of the Special Member. The "Preferred Return"
is equal to the 3-month  U.S.  Treasury  Bill yield (as defined  below) for each
month during the relevant  calendar year (or any shorter period of calculation).
The "3-month U.S.  Treasury Bill yield" for any month shall equal one-twelfth of
the annual yield for the 3-month U.S.  Treasury Bill for the first  business day
of the then current  calendar  quarter as set forth in the U.S.  Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant  maturities",
or if such  measurement  is not  available,  such other  source as the  Managing
Member may determine appropriate in its discretion.

Prior  to April  1,  2005  the  performance  allocation  was  calculated  in the
following  manner:  (1)  net  capital  appreciation  up to a 6%  return  remains
allocated to each Member (the "Preferred  Return"); (2) net capital appreciation
in excess of the Preferred  Return is reallocated to the Special Member until it
has  been  allocated  the  next  0.30%  of  return  (the  "Catch-Up");  and  (3)
thereafter,  95% of any net  capital  appreciation  in excess  of the  Preferred
Return plus the Catch-Up remains allocated to such Member,  and the remaining 5%
of such net capital appreciation is reallocated to the Special Member.

No Performance  Allocation is made, however,  with respect to a Member's capital
account until any cumulative net capital  depreciation  previously  allocated to
such   Member's   capital   account  plus  any   Management   Fees  and  Manager
Administrative   Service  Fees  charged  to  such  capital  account  (the  "Loss
Carryforward") have been recovered. Any Loss Carryforward of a Member is reduced
proportionately  to reflect  the  repurchase  of any  portion  of that  Member's
Interest.  Upon a repurchase of an Interest (other than at the end of a calendar
year) from a Member,  a Performance  Allocation will be determined and allocated
to the Special Member,  and in the case of any repurchase of a partial Interest,
on a "first in - first out" basis  (i.e.,  the  portion  of the  Interest  being
repurchased (and the amount with respect to which the Performance  Allocation is
calculated)   will  be  deemed  to  have  been  taken  from  the  first  capital
contribution  of such Member (as such  contribution  has been  adjusted  for net
capital  appreciation or depreciation,  Management Fees, Manager  Administrative
Services  Fees and other  expenses)  until it is decreased to zero and from each
subsequent  capital  contribution  until  such  contribution  (as  adjusted)  is
decreased to zero).

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

As of December 31, 2006,  $238,227 was reallocated to the capital account of the
Special Member. An additional  $13,166 was reallocated to the capital account of
the Special Member on March 31, 2007 resulting from Members tendering  interests
for  repurchase as of such date.  Based upon profits for the period from January
1, 2007 to March 31, 2007, the  additional  Incentive  Allocation  that would be
reallocated to the Special Member is $247,829.  This amount is subject to change
as Incentive Allocations occur at the end of each calendar year.

7. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance   sheet  risk.   These  include,   but  are  not  limited  to,
short-selling activities,  writing option contracts,  contracts for differences,
and interest rate,  credit default and total return equity swaps contracts.  The
Fund's risk of loss in these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of these
investments reported by the Fund.

The Fund invests primarily in Investment Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act. The Investment  Funds invest in actively  traded  securities and other
financial  instruments  using  different  strategies and investment  techniques,
including  leverage,  that may  involve  significant  risks.  Although  the Fund
attempts to  diversify  its risk by  investing in  Investment  Funds  managed by
different   third  party   managers,   the  Investment   Funds  may  nonetheless
independently  invest a high  percentage  of their assets in the same or similar
specific  sectors  of the  market  in order to  achieve  a  potentially  greater
investment  return. As a result, the Investment Funds may be more susceptible to
economic,  political,  and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the
market,  positive and negative,  and may experience  increased volatility of the
Investment  Funds' net asset  value.  The Fund  invests  in a limited  number of
Investment Funds. Such  concentration may result in additional risk.  Because of
the  limitation  on rights of  redemption  and the fact that the Fund's  limited
liability  company  interests will not be traded on any  securities  exchange or
other market and will be subject to substantial  restrictions  on transfer,  and
because  of the fact that the Fund may  invest in  Investment  Funds that do not
permit  frequent  withdrawals  and that may invest in  illiquid  securities,  an
investment  in  the  Fund  is  a  highly  illiquid  investment  and  involves  a
substantial  degree of risk.  Illiquid  securities owned by Investment Funds are
riskier than liquid  securities  because the Investment Funds may not be able to
dispose of the illiquid securities if their investment performance deteriorates,
or may be able to dispose of the illiquid  securities  only at a greatly reduced
price. Similarly, the illiquidity of the Investment Funds may cause investors to
incur losses because of an inability to withdraw their investments from the Fund
during or following  periods of negative  performance.  Although the  Investment
Manager and the Managing  Member intend to recommend  that  quarterly  offers be
made to repurchase up to 25% of the Fund's net assets, there can be no assurance
that the Fund will make such offers.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of  representations  that provide general  indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under these  arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve
future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund that have not yet  occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.

                 J.P. MORGAN ALTERNATIVE ASSET MANAGEMENT, INC.

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


Objective

J.P. Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc. ("JPMAAM"), an investment adviser
registered with the U.S.  Securities and Exchange Commission and an affiliate of
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  ("JPMC"),  is responsible  for the allocation of assets on
behalf of its clients to various private investment funds, including hedge funds
and other  alternative  investment  pools that are structured as private limited
partnerships,    limited   liability   companies   or   offshore    corporations
(collectively,  "Alternative  Investments").  The voting  rights of  Alternative
Investments  generally  are  contract  rights  set  forth in the  organizational
documents (e.g., the limited  partnership  agreement,  Limited Liability Company
agreement or  memorandum  and  articles of  association).  As  privately  placed
securities,  Alternative Investments generally are not subject to the regulatory
scheme applicable to public companies.  Consequently, in most cases, Alternative
Investments  do not issue  proxies.  Instead,  they often solicit  consents from
their limited partners, members or shareholders.


As an investment manager, JPMAAM, in the normal course of business, is typically
granted  by its  clients  the  authority  to vote the  proxies  or  consents  of
Alternative  Investments  (and very  rarely,  proxies  for  securities  that are
received as a result of in-kind  redemptions from Alternative  Investments).  In
accordance  with the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers
Act"),  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of  1974,  as  amended
("ERISA"),  and other applicable  fiduciary and regulatory  standards,  JPMAAM's
objective  is to vote  the  solicitations,  consents  and  proxies  (hereinafter
referred to as "proxies") in the best interests of its clients.  To further that
objective, JPMAAM has adopted these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures.


The Proxy Voting Process

1.       VOTING IN GENERAL.  JPMAAM's Portfolio Management Group ("PMG") as part
         of  its  ongoing  analysis  of  client  holdings  monitors  significant
         developments  relating to the  portfolio  of  Alternative  Investments.
         Situations  may arise in which more than one client invests in the same
         Alternative  Investment  or  securities.  BECAUSE  IN  THE  CONTEXT  OF
         ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS EACH SOLICITED VOTE RAISES UNIQUE QUESTIONS AND
         IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF JPMAAM'S INVESTMENT PROCESS, EACH PROXY OR OTHER
         SOLICITATION  WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATIVE  INVESTMENTS WILL BE ANALYZED
         BY A MEMBER OR MEMBERS OF PMG ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

         As a result,  JPMAAM may cast  different  votes on behalf of  different
         clients.


2.       RESPONSIBILITY  FOR  VOTE FOR ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS - PRIMARY CONTACT
         FOR  THE  MANAGER  OF  THE  UNDERLYING   HEDGE  FUND  OR  OTHER  PERSON
         IDENTIFIED. Where the proxy being voted is with respect to interests in
         an  underlying  hedge fund ("UHF")  owned by a JPMAAM client over which
         JPMAAM  has  discretionary
<PAGE>

         investment  authority,  it shall be the  responsibility  of the Primary
         portfolio  manager  ("Primary") in PMG responsible for that UHF to vote
         the proxy in a timely  manner and  otherwise in  accordance  with these
         procedures. In the absence of the Primary, the Chief Investment Officer
         shall assign such responsibility to another person in PMG in accordance
         with the procedures set forth below in this section.


3.       PROCEDURES  FOR  VOTING  PROXIES.  JPMAAM  has  adopted  the  following
         procedures in order to ensure that all proxy materials are processed in
         a timely fashion:

         o    All  proxies  and  related  materials  should be  received  by, or
              forwarded to, JPMAAM  Operations  ("Operations")  and processed by
              the designated person or persons within Operations.

         o    Operations will:

                   o     Forward the materials by e-mail to:

                            |X|     the Primary for that UHF/manager, as well as
                                    PMG as a whole; and

                            |X|     the Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO").

                   o     Include in the cover email the following information:

                            |X|     name of UHF and manager;

                            |X|     name(s)  of the JPMAAM  client  portfolio(s)
                                    holding interests in this UHF; and

                            |X|     the  date  and  time by  which  JPMAAM  must
                                    submit  the proxy (the  "Voting  Deadline").
                                    (This  is  to  allow  enough  time  for  the
                                    completed proxy to be returned to the issuer
                                    prior to the Voting Deadline.)

         o    The CCO will initially review the proxy material to determine if a
              material  conflict of interest  exists that would prevent PMG from
              voting.  If there is no conflict  of interest  the CCO will inform
              PMG  that it may vote the  proxy as it  determines.  If there is a
              material  conflict of  interest,  see  Escalation  of Conflicts of
              Interest, below.

         o    The  Primary,  upon  receiving  approval  from the CCO to vote the
              proxy, will analyze the proxy materials and make a decision on how
              to  vote  the  proxy,  conferring  with  other  PMG  personnel  if
              appropriate.  The Primary shall promptly  communicate via email or
              otherwise  in writing the decision as to how to vote each proxy to
              Operations  (by close of  business  on the day  before  the Voting
              Deadline,  unless otherwise agreed with  Operations),  copying the
              CCO.  Once  instructions  are received in a timely manner from the
              Primary,  Operations  shall have  responsibility  for  completing,
              executing and submitting the proxy prior to the Voting Deadline.

         o    In some cases, proxy materials may stipulate how a failure to vote
              the proxy will be interpreted  (for example,  proxy  materials may
              stipulate that a "no" vote will be deemed to be a vote in favor of
              the proposal,  or that there is no need to submit a proxy if there
              is an intention  to vote in favor of a  proposal).  In such cases,
              the Primary must still determine how to vote the proxy, and convey
              this  decision  via  email  or  other  written   communication  to
              Operations,  as described  above. If the proxy  materials  dictate
              that an actual  written  proxy need not be  submitted,  Operations
              shall  still  email  PMG's  decision to the UHF and keep a copy of
              that email in its files.


MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Rule 206(4)-6  under the Advisers Act requires that the proxy voting  procedures
adopted and implemented by a registered  investment  adviser include  procedures
that  address  material  conflicts  of  interests  that may  arise  between  the
investment  adviser and its clients  and/or  investors.  Material  conflicts  of
interest may arise when  management  of a JPMAAM client or  prospective  client,
distributor or prospective distributor of its investment management products, or
critical  vendor,  is  soliciting  proxies  and  failure  to  vote in  favor  of
management  may affect  JPMAAM's  relationship  with such company and materially
impact  JPMAAM's  business;  or when a  personal  relationship  between a JPMAAM
officer and management of a company or other proponents of proxy proposals could
impact the voting  decision.  Given  JPMAAM's  position as a subsidiary of JPMC,
material  conflicts of interest can also arise between the interests of JPMC and
JPMAAM's clients.
<PAGE>

ESCALATION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The CCO is responsible for initially identifying potential material conflicts of
interest. If a potential material conflict of interest is identified by the CCO,
JPMAAM will forward the proxy material to internal and/or  external  counsel for
review. Such counsel will provide their advice on proceeding with the vote. If a
material  conflict of interest is  identified  involving the interests of JPMAAM
and  its  clients  or  investors,  it is  the  responsibility  of  the  CCO,  in
consultation  with senior  management and the Proxy Voting Committee  (described
below) to evaluate the matter and determine the final voting decision.

Depending upon the nature of the material conflict, JPMAAM may elect to take one
or more of the following measures, or other appropriate action:

        |_|   removing certain JPMAAM personnel from the proxy voting process;
        |_|   "walling off" personnel with knowledge of the material conflict to
              ensure that such  personnel do not  influence  the relevant  proxy
              vote;
        |_|   deferring  the  vote  to  a  proxy  voting  service  and  vote  in
              accordance with their recommendation; or
        |_|   abstaining from voting the proxy.


The resolution of all potential and actual material conflict issues presented to
senior management will be thoroughly documented.


PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

A Proxy Voting Committee composed of senior individuals from Legal,  Compliance,
Risk  Management,  PMG and  Operations  provides  oversight  of the proxy voting
process on an on-going basis.  The primary  purposes of the Committee are to (i)
periodically review general proxy voting matters, and (ii) discuss and arrive at
conclusions on more controversial proxy voting issues.


RECORDKEEPING

JPMAAM is required to maintain in an easily  accessible place for five (5) years
all records  relating to the proxy  voting  process  (the first two years at the
office of JPMAAM). Those records will be kept by Operations and will include the
following:


    |_| a copy of each proxy statement received on behalf of JPMAAM clients;
    |_| a record of each vote cast on behalf of JPMAAM client holdings;
    |_| a copy of all documents  created by JPMAAM  personnel that were material
        to  making  a  decision  on the  voting  of  client  securities  or that
        memorialize the basis of the decision; and
    |_| a copy of each written  request by a JPMAAM  investor for information on
        how JPMAAM voted proxies on behalf of a client, as well as a copy of any
        written response by JPMAAM to any request by an investor for information
        on how JPMAAM voted proxies on behalf of a client.

     Potential  conflicts  of interest may arise  regarding  the  allocation  of
     limited  investment  opportunities to the Fund and Other Adviser  Accounts.
     Some  of  the  Other  Adviser  Accounts  may  have  investment  objectives,
     strategies  and  risks  that  differ  from  that  of  the  Fund.  Different
     investments  may be purchased for the Fund and for Other  Adviser  Accounts
     and the  performance of  investments  purchased by the Fund may differ from
     that of the investments purchased for Other Adviser Accounts.  Transactions
     placed on behalf of Other Adviser  Accounts that are directly or indirectly
     contrary to investment  decisions  made for the Fund may have
<PAGE>

    the  potential  to  adversely  impact the Fund.  The Adviser has adopted and
    implemented  policies and  procedures to address the potential  conflicts of
    interest  associated with managing  multiple  accounts on behalf of multiple
    clients. The Adviser monitors a variety of areas,  including compliance with
    any stated investment guidelines and restrictions and the performance of the
    Fund and the Other  Adviser  Accounts,  to ensure that each account is being
    managed  appropriately  and  in  accordance  with  the  Adviser's  fiduciary
    obligations to all its clients.

     As  of  March  31,  2007,  the  Adviser's   portfolio  managers  receive  a
     compensation  package made up of a base salary and an annual  discretionary
     bonus.  Discretionary  bonuses  are  closely  tied to a variety of factors,
     including but not limited to, the  investment  performance  of all accounts
     managed by the Adviser, the Adviser's overall business performance, as well
     as the individual portfolio manager's  contribution to that performance and
     the Adviser's  business  generally  including the  education,  training and
     support  of  the  Adviser's  other  personnel.  Discretionary  bonuses  are
     comprised  of a  combination  of mandatory  and  voluntary  bonus  deferral
     programs and a cash component. Mandatory bonus deferral is generally in the
     form of JPMorgan  Chase  stock,  subject to a vesting  period.  For certain
     senior portfolio  managers,  a part of the mandatory deferral amount may be
     allocated among different  investment choices including a pooled investment
     vehicle  managed by the  Adviser,  also  subject to a vesting  period.  The
     voluntary bonus deferral program has various investment choices including a
     pooled investment vehicle managed by the Adviser.

     As of March 31, 2007, none of the persons involved in the management of the
     Fund's portfolio beneficially owns any interest in the Fund.

         registrant's  disclosure  controls and  procedures  (as defined in Rule
         30a-3(c)  under the  Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended  (the
         "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c)))  are effective,  as of a date within
         90 days of the filing date of the report that  includes the  disclosure
         required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these controls
         and  procedures  required by Rule  30a-3(b)  under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
         270.30a-3(b))  and Rules  13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)  under the  Securities
         Exchange   Act  of  1934,   as  amended   (17  CFR   240.13a-15(b)   or
         240.15d-15(b)).

    (b)  There  were  no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR 270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the registrant's  second fiscal
         quarter  of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has  materially
         affected,   or  is  reasonably   likely  to  materially   affect,   the
         registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

<TEXT>
                     J.P. MORGAN MULTI-STRATEGY FUND, L.L.C.
      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER


I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This Code of Ethics (this "Code") of J. P. Morgan  Multi-Strategy Fund,
L.L.C. (the "Fund") applies to the Fund's principal executive officer, principal
financial  officer,  principal  accounting  officer  or  controller,  or persons
performing  similar  functions  (including in their capacity as officers of J.P.
Morgan Alternative Asset Management, Inc. (the "Investment Manager")),  which as
of the date of  adoption  of this Code are the  persons  named in Exhibit A (the
"Covered Officers"), for the purpose of promoting:

         o   honest and  ethical  conduct,  including  the  ethical  handling of
             actual or apparent  conflicts  of  interest  between  personal  and
             professional relationships;

         o   full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure  in
             reports and documents  that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
             Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") and in other  public
             communications made by the Fund;

         o   compliance  with  applicable  laws  and   governmental   rules  and
             regulations;

         o   the prompt  internal  reporting  of  violations  of this Code to an
             appropriate person or persons identified in this Code; and

         o   accountability for adherence to this Code.

Each Covered  Officer  should adhere to a high  standard of business  ethics and
should  be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give  rise to  actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD ETHICALLY HANDLE ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
private  interest  interferes  with the interests of, or his/her service to, the
Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a
member of his/her family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits as a result of
his/her position or relationship with the Fund.

         Certain  conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the Fund and  already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company Act") and
the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940  ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions  (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other  property)  with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated  persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and the Investment
Manager's  compliance  programs  and  procedures  are  designed to  prevent,  or
identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is
not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures.

         Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit,  conflicts  may  arise  from,  or  as  a  result  of,  the  contractual
relationship  between the Fund and the  Investment  Manager of which the Covered
Officers may also be officers or employees.  As a result,  this Code  recognizes
that the Covered  Officers  will, in the normal course of their duties  (whether
formally for the Fund,  the  Investment  Manager,  or for both),  be involved in
establishing policies and implementing
<PAGE>

decisions  that may have  different  effects on the  Investment  Manager and the
Fund. The  participation  of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the contractual  relationship between the Fund and the Investment Manager and
is consistent  with the  performance by the Covered  Officers of their duties as
officers of, or persons  performing similar functions with respect to, the Fund.
Thus, if performed in conformity  with the provisions of the Investment  Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been
handled  ethically.  In  addition,  it is  recognized  by the  Fund's  Board  of
Directors  ("the  Board")  that the  Covered  Officers  may also be  officers or
employees  of one or more  other  investment  companies  covered by this Code or
other codes.

         Other  conflicts  of interest  are  covered by this Code,  even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to  provisions in the  Investment  Company
Act or the  Investment  Advisers  Act. The following  list provides  examples of
conflicts of interest under this Code, but Covered  Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the
personal  interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly  before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o   not  use  his/her  personal  influence  or  personal  relationships
             improperly  to  influence  investment  decisions  and/or  financial
             reporting by the Fund  whereby the Covered  Officer  would  benefit
             personally to the detriment of the Fund;

         o   not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action,  for the
             individual  personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
             benefit of the Fund; and

         o   complete  on an  annual  basis  the  Fund's  Director  and  Officer
             Questionnaire which requests  information  regarding other business
             affiliations and relationships.

         In  furtherance  of the above,  below are some  examples of conflict of
interest  situations  that should be discussed  with the  designated  compliance
officer  of  the  Investment   Manager  and/or  the  Fund,  as  applicable  (the
"Compliance Officer"). Examples of these include, but are not limited to:

         o   serving as a director on the board of any public or private company
             or not for profit organization;

         o   the  receipt  of any gifts in  excess  of $100  from any  person or
             company  with which the Fund has  current or  prospective  business
             dealings;

         o   the receipt of any  entertainment  from any company  with which the
             Fund has  current or  prospective  business  dealings  unless  such
             entertainment is business related,  reasonable in cost, appropriate
             as to time and place,  and not so frequent as to raise any question
             of impropriety or other  formulation as the Fund may already use in
             any other code of conduct;

         o   any  ownership   interest  in,  or  any  consulting  or  employment
             relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers,  other than
             its Investment Manager, principal underwriter, administrator and/or
             any affiliated person thereof; and

         o   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
             charges  or  spreads  paid  by the  Fund  for  effecting  portfolio
             transactions  or for  selling  or  redeeming  shares  other than an
             interest  arising from the Covered  Officer's  employment,  such as
             compensation or equity ownership.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o   Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
             disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund.

         o   Each Covered  Officer should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause
             others to  misrepresent,  facts  about the Fund to others,  whether
             within or outside the Fund,  including to the Fund's  directors and
             auditors,  and/or to  governmental  regulators and  self-regulatory
             organizations.

         o   Each  Covered  Officer  should,  to the extent  appropriate  within
             his/her area of  responsibility,  consult  with other  officers and
             employees of the Fund and the  Investment  Manager with the goal of
             promoting  full,   fair,   accurate,   timely  and   understandable
             disclosure  in the reports and  documents  the Fund files with,  or
             submits to, the SEC and in other public  communications made by the
             Fund.

         o   It is  the  responsibility  of  each  Covered  Officer  to  promote
             compliance   with  the  standards  and   restrictions   imposed  by
             applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o   upon  adoption  of this Code (or  thereafter  as  applicable,  upon
             becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board, within
             a reasonable period of time, that he or she has received, read, and
             understands this Code;

         o   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied
             with the requirements of the Code;

         o   not retaliate against any other Covered Officer and/or any employee
             of  the  Fund  or  affiliated  persons  for  reports  of  potential
             violations that are made in good faith; and

         o   notify the  Compliance  Officer  promptly if he or she knows of any
             violation of this Code.

         Failure to comply  with the  foregoing  is itself a  violation  of this
Code.

         The  Compliance  Officer  is  responsible,  for  applying  this Code to
specific  situations in which questions are presented relating to this Code. The
Compliance  Officer has the authority to interpret  this Code in any  particular
situation. However, any waivers sought by any Covered Officer will require prior
review  and  approval  by the Board  (including,  to the extent  required  under
applicable law, a majority of the independent directors of the Board).

           The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

         o   the  Compliance  Officer  (or his or her  designee)  will  take all
             appropriate action to investigate any potential violations reported
             to him or her;

         o   if, after such investigation,  the Compliance Officer believes that
             no violation has occurred,  the Compliance  Officer is not required
             to take any further action;

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         o   any matter the Compliance  Officer  believes to be a violation will
             be  reported  by the  Compliance  Officer  to the Board  which will
             consider appropriate action,  which may include:  review of, and/or
             appropriate  modifications to, applicable  policies and procedures;
             notification to appropriate  personnel of the Investment Manager or
             its board;  and/or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;
             and

         o   the Board (including,  to the extent required under applicable law,
             a majority  of the  independent  directors  of the  Board)  will be
             responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This  Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the Fund for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies  or  procedures  of  the  Fund,  the  Investment   Manager,   principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions of this Code. The Fund's and the Investment Manager's codes of ethics
under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act are separate requirements that
may apply to the Covered Officers and others, are not part of this Code, and are
not superceded in any way by this Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of
the independent directors.  Any amendments to Exhibit A must be disclosed to the
Board at the next scheduled meeting of the Board.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records  prepared or  maintained  pursuant to this Code
will  be  considered   confidential   and  shall  be  maintained  and  protected
accordingly.  Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         This Code is intended  solely for internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute  an  admission,  by or on  behalf  of  the  Fund,  as  to  any  fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

         the periods presented in this report;

4.       The registrant's other certifying  officer(s) and I are responsible for
         establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls and procedures (as

         internal control over financial  reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d)

         (a)  Designed such disclosure  controls and procedures,  or caused such
              disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to be  designed  under  our

              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure

              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second

              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's

              supervision,  to ensure that material  information relating to the
              registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
              to us by others  within those  entities,  particularly  during the
              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed
              under our supervision,  to provide reasonable  assurance regarding
              the  reliability  of financial  reporting and the  preparation  of
              financial  statements  for external  purposes in  accordance  with
              generally accepted accounting principles;

         (c)  Evaluated  the   effectiveness  of  the  registrant's   disclosure
              controls  and   procedures   and  presented  in  this  report  our
              conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and
<PAGE>

         (d)  Disclosed in this report any change in the  registrant's  internal
              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
              internal control over financial reporting.
