DEAR FUND SHAREHOLDER,

We are pleased to present you with the unaudited financial statements of The
India Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for the six-month period ended June 30, 2003.


The Fund's net asset value (NAV) closed at $14.21 on June 30, 2003, representing
an increase of 11.71% during the six months ended on that date. The Fund
outperformed its benchmark, the IFC Investable Index which gained 7.73% during
the same period.


We believe that economically India will continue to thrive. We believe fiscal
year 2004 gross domestic product will be driven by services and a rebound in
agriculture aided by the strong start of the monsoon season. In our opinion,
retail lending remains strong particularly in the housing sector and corporate
lending has begun to show signs of revival especially in key sectors such as
steel and textiles.


On behalf of the Board of Directors, we thank you for your participation and
continued support of the Fund. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate
to call our toll-free number, (800) 421-4777.


Sincerely,

/S/ BRYAN MCKIGNEY

Bryan McKigney
Chairman and President

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE IN INVESTMENT POLICY

On April 30, 2002,  the Board of Directors of the Fund  approved a change to the
Fund's  investment  policies  in  connection  with  new  Rule  35d-1  under  the
Investment Company Act of 1940. Under normal conditions, the Fund will invest at
least 80% of the value of its assets in equity  securities  of Indian  Companies
(as  defined  in the  Fund's  prospectus.)  Previously,  the  Fund's  investment
policies  stated  that the Fund  would  invest  at least 65% of the value of its
assets in such  securities.  The Board  also  adopted  a policy to  provide  the
stockholders  of the Fund with 60 days'  notice of any change to the  investment
policy adopted if such notice is required by Rule 35d-1.


FUNDAMENTAL PERIODIC REPURCHASE POLICY

The Fund  has  adopted  the  following  fundamental  policy  regarding  periodic
repurchases:

   a) The Fund  will  make  offers  to  repurchase  its  shares  at  semi-annual
      intervals pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
      as amended from time to time ("Offers").  The Board of Directors may place
      such  conditions and  limitations on Offers as may be permitted under Rule
      23c-3.

   b) 14 days  prior to the last  Friday of the  Fund's  first and third  fiscal
      quarters,  or the next  business day if such Friday is not a business day,
      will be the deadline (the "Repurchase Request Deadline") by which the Fund
      must receive repurchase  requests submitted by stockholders in response to
      the most recent Offer.

   c) The date on which the repurchase price for shares is to be determined (the
      "Repurchase  Pricing  Date")  shall occur no later than the last Friday of
      the Fund's first and third fiscal  quarters,  or the next  business day if
      such day is not a business day.

   d) Offers may be suspended  or  postponed  under  certain  circumstances,  as
      provided for in Rule 23c-3.


SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

The  Board  of  Directors  of the Fund  previously  had  authorized  the Fund to
repurchase  from time to time in the open market up to  4,000,000  shares of the
Fund's  common  stock at such times and in such amounts as  management  believed
will  enhance  shareholders  value,  subject  to review by the  Fund's  Board of
Directors. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Fund repurchased a total
of 89,000 shares of its common stock. This repurchase program has been suspended
by the Board of  Directors  since the Fund's  stockholders  approved an interval
fund  structure at the Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders  held on April 23, 2003.
(For  details  regarding  shares  repurchased  by the  Fund,  see  Note E to the
Financial Statements.)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                        (UNAUDITED)

NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The India Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated in Maryland on December 27,
1993, and commenced operations on February 23, 1994. The Fund operates through a
branch in the Republic of Mauritius. The Fund is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940,  as amended,  as a closed-end,  non-diversified  management
investment company.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

PORTFOLIO  VALUATION.  Investments  are  stated  at  value  in the  accompanying
financial  statements.  All securities  for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at:

     (i)   the last sales price prior to the time of determination, if there was
           a sale on the date of determination,

     (ii)  at the mean between the last current bid and asked  prices,  if there
           was no sales  price on such  date and bid and  asked  quotations  are
           available, and

     (iii) at the bid  price if there  was no sales  price on such date and only
           bid quotations are available.

Securities  that  are  traded  over-the-counter  are  valued,  if bid and  asked
quotations are available,  at the mean between the current bid and asked prices.
Securities for which sales prices and bid and asked quotations are not available
on the date of determination may be valued at the most recently available prices
or quotations under policies  adopted by the Board of Directors.  Investments in
short-term  debt  securities  having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized  cost which  approximates  market value.  Securities  for which market
values are not  readily  ascertainable,  which  totaled  $658,804  (0.17% of net
assets) at June 30, 2003,  are carried at fair value as determined in good faith
by or under the  supervision of the Board of Directors.  The net asset value per
share of the Fund is calculated weekly and at the end of each month.

INVESTMENT  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME.  Investment  transactions  are
accounted for on the trade date. The cost of  investments  sold is determined by
use of the  specific  identification  method for both  financial  reporting  and
income tax reporting purposes. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis;
dividend  income  is  recorded  on the  ex-dividend  date or,  using  reasonable
diligence,  when known.  The  collectibility  of income  receivable  from Indian
securities  is  evaluated   periodically,   and  any  resulting  allowances  for
uncollectible amounts are reflected currently in the determination of investment
income.


                                                                              15

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

TAX STATUS.  No provision is made for U.S.  Federal income or excise taxes as it
is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to  make  the  requisite  distributions  to its  shareholders  that  will be
sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all Federal income and excise
taxes.

Income and capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2002:

                                                            THE INDIA FUND, INC.


                                                                   JUNE 30, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

At December 31, 2002, the Fund had a capital loss carryover of $76,658,179 which
is available to offset future net realized gains on securities  transactions  to
the extent provided for in the Internal  Revenue Code. Of the aggregate  capital
losses,  $9,970,780  will  expire  in 2005,  $34,828,858  will  expire  in 2006,
$20,935,877 will expire in 2009 and $10,922,664 will expire in 2010.

The Fund's  realized  capital losses incurred after October 31, 2002, but before
December  31,  2002,  are  deemed  to arise  on the  first  business  day of the
following  year.  The Fund incurred and elected to defer such  realized  capital
losses of $3,018,507.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S.  dollars.  Foreign  currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (i)   market value of investment securities,  assets and liabilities at the
           prevailing rates of exchange on the valuation date; and

     (ii)  purchases and sales of investment securities and investment income at
           the relevant rates of exchange  prevailing on the respective dates of
           such transactions.

The Fund  generally  does not  isolate  the  effect of  fluctuations  in foreign
exchange  rates  from  the  effect  of  fluctuations  in the  market  prices  of
securities. However, the Fund does isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency  rates  when  determining  the gain or loss  upon  the sale of  foreign
currency  denominated  debt  obligations  pursuant  to U.S.  Federal  income tax
regulations;  such amounts are  categorized as foreign  currency gains or losses
for federal  income tax  purposes.  The Fund reports  certain  realized  foreign
exchange  gains and  losses as  components  of  realized  gains and  losses  for
financial  reporting  purposes,  whereas  such  amounts  are treated as ordinary
income for Federal income tax reporting purposes.

Securities  denominated  in  currencies  other than U.S.  dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in foreign  exchange.  Foreign security and
currency transactions may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of domestic  origin as a result of, among other  factors,
the level of  governmental  supervision  and  regulation  of foreign  securities
markets and the possibility of political or economic  instability,  and the fact
that foreign  securities markets may be smaller and have less developed and less
reliable settlement and share registration procedures.

DISTRIBUTION  OF INCOME AND GAINS.  The Fund intends to  distribute  annually to
shareholders,  substantially all of its net investment income, including foreign
currency  gains,  and to  distribute  annually any net realized  gains after the
utilization of available capital loss carryovers. An additional distribution may
be made to the extent necessary to avoid payment of a 4% Federal excise tax.


                                                                              17

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


                                                                   JUNE 30, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

Distributions to shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date. The amount
of dividends and distributions from net investment income and net realized gains
are  determined in accordance  with Federal  income tax  regulations,  which may
differ from  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United States of
America.  These  "book/tax"  differences  are  either  considered  temporary  or
permanent in nature.  To the extent these  differences  are permanent in nature,
such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their Federal
tax-basis  treatment;  temporary  differences  do not require  reclassification.
Dividends and distributions  which exceed net investment income and net realized
capital  gains for  financial  reporting  purposes  but not for tax purposes are
reported  as  dividends  in excess of net  investment  income  and net  realized
capital gains. To the extent they exceed net investment  income and net realized
gains for tax purposes, they are reported as distributions of additional paid-in
capital.

During the period ended December 31, 2002, the Fund  reclassified  $137,200 from
accumulated  net  realized  loss  on  investments  to  overdistribution  of  net
investment  income as a result of permanent  book and tax  differences  relating
primarily to realized  foreign currency  losses.  Net investment  income and net
assets were not affected by the reclassifications.

months ended June 30, 2003,  fees earned by the Investment  Manager  amounted to
$1,852,824.

Fahnestock,  a  registered  investment  advisor  and  an  indirect  wholly-owned
subsidiary  of Fahnestock  Viner  Holdings  Inc.  ("FVH"),  serves as the Fund's
Administrator  (the  "Administrator")  pursuant to an  administration  agreement
dated June 5, 2003. The Administrator provides certain  administrative  services
to the Fund. For its services,  the  Administrator  receives a monthly fee at an
annual rate of 0.20% of the Fund's average weekly net assets. For the six months

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2003

fees amounted to $336,877 (Prior to June 5, 2003,  administration fees were paid
to CIBC World Markets Corp.).  The Administrator  subcontracts  certain of these
services  to  PFPC,  Inc.  In  addition,   Multiconsult   Ltd.  (the  "Mauritius
Administrator")   provides  certain  administrative  services  relating  to  the
operation and maintenance of the Fund in Mauritius.  The Mauritius Administrator
receives  a monthly  fee of $1,500  and is  reimbursed  for  certain  additional
expenses.  For the six months  ended June 30,  2003,  fees and  expenses  of the
Mauritius Administrator amounted to $16,057.

On December 10, 2002,  Canadian  Imperial  Bank of Commerce,  CIBC World Markets
Corp.  ("CIBC WM"),  Fahnestock and FVH announced that  Fahnestock had agreed to
acquire  the U.S.  brokerage  and asset  management  businesses  of CIBC WM. The
acquisition  of the U.S.  brokerage  business  closed on  January  3,  2003.  As
required under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"),
the Fund's then existing  Management  Agreement and Country  Advisory  Agreement
provided for their automatic  termination in the event of their  "assignment" as
defined in the 1940 Act.  Consummation  of the acquisition by Fahnestock and FVH
of the asset  management  business of CIBC WM  constituted  an assignment of the
Fund's then existing Management  Agreement and Country Advisory Agreement.  At a
meeting on January 17, 2003,  the Board of  Directors  of the Fund,  including a
majority of the  independent  Directors,  approved a new  investment  management
agreement  between the Fund and Advantage and a new Country  Advisory  Agreement
between Advantage and Imperial. As required by the 1940 Act, stockholders of the
Fund  approved  the new  investment  management  agreement  and the new  country
advisory agreement at the Fund's 2003 annual meeting of stockholders. Fahnestock
completed  its  acquisition  of the asset  management  business on June 4, 2003.
Fahnestock  replaced  CIBC  WM as the  Fund's  administrator  and  FVH  acquired
ultimate control of Advantage and Imperial.

The Fund pays each of its directors  who is not a director,  officer or employee
of the  Investment  Manager,  the Country  Adviser or the  Administrator  or any
affiliate  thereof  an annual  fee of $5,000  plus up to $700 for each  Board of
Directors meeting attended.  In addition,  the Fund reimburses all directors for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with Board of Directors
meetings.

NOTE C: PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY

Purchases and sales of securities, other than short-term obligations, aggregated
$47,098,643  and  $56,976,562  respectively,  for the six months  ended June 30,
2003.

NOTE D: FOREIGN INCOME TAX

The Fund  conducts  its  investment  activities  in India as a tax  resident  of
Mauritius  and  expects  to obtain  benefits  under the double  taxation  treaty
between  Mauritius and India (the "tax treaty" or "treaty").  To obtain benefits
under  the  double  taxation  treaty,  the Fund  must  meet  certain  tests  and
conditions,  including the  establishment of Mauritius tax residence and related
requirements. The Fund has obtained


                                                                              19

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


                                                                   JUNE 30, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

a certificate from the Mauritian  authorities that it is a resident of Mauritius
under the double  taxation  treaty  between  Mauritius and India.  Under current
regulations,  a fund which is a tax resident in Mauritius under the treaty,  but
has no branch  or  permanent  establishment  in India,  will not be  subject  to
capital  gains tax in India on the sale of  securities  but is  subject to a 15%
withholding tax on dividends declared,  distributed or paid by an Indian company
prior to June 1, 1997 and after March 31,  2002.  During the period June 1, 1997
through March 31, 2002,  dividend income from domestic companies was exempt from
Indian  income tax.  Effective  April 1, 2003,  dividend  income  from  domestic
companies is exempt from Indian tax.  The Fund is subject to and accrues  Indian
withholding  tax on interest  earned on Indian  securities  at the rate of 20.5%
effective  April 1, 2003,  21% between April 1, 2002 and April 1, 2003,  and 20%
prior to April 1, 2002.

The  Fund  will,  in any year  that it has  taxable  income  for  Mauritius  tax
purposes,  elect to pay tax on its net income for  Mauritius tax purposes at any
rate between 0% and 35%.

In March 2000,  the Indian tax  authorities  issued an assessment  order ("March
2000  Assessment  Order")  with respect to the Fund's  Indian  income tax return
filed for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 which  denied the benefits of the
tax treaty between India and Mauritius.  In the March 2000 Assessment Order, the
Indian tax  authorities  held that the Fund is not a resident of  Mauritius  and
assessed  tax on the  dividend  income for the year ended  March 31, 1997 at the
rate of 20%,  instead  of the 15% rate  claimed by the Fund under the tax treaty
between India and Mauritius.  Similar  assessment  orders were issued to several
other  mutual  fund  companies  relying  on the tax  treaty  between  India  and
Mauritius.  On April 13, 2000, the Central Board of Direct Taxes ("CBDT") of the
Ministry of Finance in India issued a circular ("Circular 789") "clarifying" its
position on Indian  taxation  under the tax treaty  between  India and Mauritius
that,   wherever  a  certificate   of  residence  is  issued  by  the  Mauritian
authorities,  such certificate will constitute sufficient evidence for accepting
the status of residence  as well as  beneficial  ownership  for applying the tax
treaty  between India and  Mauritius.  The Fund,  relying on Circular 789 and in
absence of a  rectification  order from the assessing  officer,  filed an appeal
against  the March  2000  Assessment  Order  with the  Indian  tax  authorities.
Hearings on the appeal were scheduled in which the Fund made  submissions to the
Indian tax  authorities,  however,  the  hearings  were  adjourned by Indian tax
authorities, each time without a decision.

Previously, however, an Indian public interest group had initiated litigation in
the Indian courts challenging  Circular 789. In connection with this litigation,
the Delhi High Court, in May 2002,  passed an order  invalidating  Circular 789.
The history of past assessments by the Indian tax authorities (prior to issuance
of Circular  789) and the  arguments  made in the recent Delhi High Court ruling
suggest that the Indian tax  authorities  may adopt an  aggressive  position and
investigate  the  taxability  of  Mauritius  based funds,  i.e.,  the Indian tax
authorities  may look beyond the tax residency  certificate  issued by Mauritius
tax  authorities to Mauritius  based funds.  The Indian tax authorities may also
seek to reopen previously completed  assessments of the Fund's Indian income tax
returns and deny

                                                            THE INDIA FUND, INC.


                                                                   JUNE 30, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)                            (UNAUDITED)

the benefits of the tax treaty  between India and Mauritius to the Fund.  During
the period the public  interest  litigation  was pending with the high courts in
India,  the Indian tax authorities  were generally  allowing the benefits of the
tax treaty  between  India and  Mauritius  to Mauritius  based funds  relying on
Circular 789,  however,  the assessment  orders issued were conditional upon the
outcome of the public interest litigation.

The  Government  of India had filed a Special Leave  Petition  against the Delhi
High Court Order.  Newspaper  reports  indicate  that the matter has come up for
hearing and the Supreme Court has reserved its judgement in this matter.

To the  extent  that it is later  determined  that the Fund  would be  unable to
obtain the  benefits of the treaty,  the Fund would be subject to tax on capital
gains in India on the prior sale of securities, which are currently at the rates
of 10.25% on long-term  capital  gains and 30.75% on  short-term  capital  gains
(10.5% and 31.5%, respectively,  between April 1, 2002 and April 1, 2003 and 10%
and 30%, respectively, prior to April 1, 2002). Further, the Fund, if the treaty
benefits are denied,  would be subject to tax on dividend  income  earned by the
Fund prior to June 1, 1997 at 20% and  subsequent  to March 31,  2002 at 21%. As
already stated above, from April 1, 2003 dividend income is exempt from tax.

In addition,  for the fiscal years for which the assessment of the Fund's Indian
tax  returns  has been  completed,  the Indian tax  authorities  have denied the
carryforward  of  realized  capital  losses  incurred by the Fund in such fiscal
years on the grounds that the Fund was not subject to taxes on realized  capital
gains in India due to the  application of the benefits of the tax treaty between
India and Mauritius to the Fund. Therefore, the Fund may not, in a year in which
it has net realized  capital  gains and the  benefits of the tax treaty  between
India and Mauritius are denied by the Indian tax authorities,  be able to offset
capital losses realized in previous years.

The Fund  continues  to:  (i)  comply  with the  requirements  of the tax treaty
between  India and  Mauritius;  (ii) be a tax resident of  Mauritius;  and (iii)
maintain  that its central  management  and  control  resides in  Mauritius  and
therefore  management believes that the Fund will be able to obtain the benefits
of the tax treaty  between India and  Mauritius.  Accordingly,  no provision for
Indian income taxes has been made in  accompanying  financial  statements of the
Fund.

The foregoing is based upon current  interpretation  and practice and is subject
to future  changes in Indian or  Mauritian  tax laws and in the  treaty  between
India and Mauritius.

Although  management  of the Fund  expects  to obtain  the  benefits  of the tax
treaty, if the Fund were denied such benefits retrospectively, the Fund could be
subject to cumulative income taxes, interest and penalties. Management estimates
that the amount of taxes and interest, based on realized gains


                                                                              21

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


                                                                   JUNE 30, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONCLUDED)                            (UNAUDITED)

through June 30, 2003 and  unrealized  gains as of June 30, 2003 could be in the
range of $23.0  million to $43.8  million (6% to 11% of the Fund's net assets at
June 30, 2003). This range does not include penalties which could be assessed as
such  penalties  are not  determinable.  The  aforementioned  range is estimated
utilizing  various  assumptions  as to how  the  Indian  tax  authorities  might
interpret the calculation of Indian income taxes if the tax treaty benefits were
denied.  Actual  amounts,  if  incurred,  could  differ  significantly  from the
aforementioned estimate.

NOTE E: CAPITAL STOCK

During the year ended  December 31, 2002,  the Fund  purchased  89,000 shares of
capital  stock on the open  market at a total  cost of  $920,118.  The  weighted
average  discount of these  purchases,  comparing the purchase  price to the net
asset value at the time of purchase,  was 17.29%.  These  shares were  purchased
pursuant to the Fund's Stock  Repurchase Plan previously  approved by the Fund's
Board of Directors  authorizing  the Fund to purchase up to 4,000,000  shares of
its capital stock on the open market.

At a meeting of the Board of Directors  held on January 29,  2002,  the Board of
Directors  approved  a tender  offer.  Pursuant  to the tender  offer,  the Fund
offered to purchase up to 10% of the Fund's  outstanding  shares of common stock
for cash at a price  equal to 95% of the Fund's net asset  value per share as of
the closing date.  The tender offer  commenced on August 30, 2002 and expired on
September  27, 2002. In connection  with the tender  offer,  the Fund  purchased
3,063,433  shares of  capital  stock at a total cost of  $33,375,712,  including
expenses of $168,098.

In  February  2003,  the Board of  Directors  approved,  subject to  stockholder
approval,  a fundamental  policy whereby the Fund would adopt an "interval fund"
structure  pursuant  to Rule 23c-3  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940.
Stockholders  of the Fund were to approve  the  policy at the Annual  Meeting of
Stockholders  held on April 23, 2003,  however the proposal  was  adjourned  and
later  approved on April 30, 2003. As an interval  fund, the Fund will make semi
annual  repurchase  offers at net asset value (less a 2% repurchase  fee) to all
Fund  stockholders.  The  percentage  of  outstanding  shares  that the Fund can
repurchase  in each offer will be  established  by the Fund's Board of Directors
shortly before the  commencement of each quarterly offer, and will be between 5%
and 25% of the Fund's then outstanding shares.

NOTE F: CONCENTRATION OF RISKS

At June 30, 2003,  substantially  all of the Fund's net assets were  invested in
Indian  securities.  The  Indian  securities  markets  are  among  other  things
substantially  smaller, less developed,  less liquid, subject to less regulation
and  more  volatile  than  the   securities   markets  in  the  United   States.
Consequently,  and as further discussed above,  acquisitions and dispositions of
securities by the Fund involve special risks and considerations not present with
respect to U.S.  securities.  At June 30, 2003, the Fund has a concentration  of
its investment in computer and technology-related industries. The values of such
investments may be affected by changes in such industry sectors.

                                                            THE INDIA FUND, INC.


DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund intends to distribute annually to shareholders substantially all of its
net investment income, and to distribute any net realized capital gains at least
annually.  Net  investment  income  for this  purpose  is income  other than net
realized long and short-term capital gains net of expenses.

Pursuant to the  Dividend  Reinvestment  and Cash  Purchase  Plan (the  "Plan"),
shareholders whose shares of Common Stock are registered in their own names will
be deemed to have elected to have all distributions  automatically reinvested by
the Plan Agent in Fund  shares  pursuant to the Plan,  unless such  shareholders
elect to  receive  distributions  in cash.  Shareholders  who  elect to  receive
distributions  in cash will receive all  distributions  in cash paid by check in
dollars mailed  directly to the shareholder by the dividend paying agent. In the
case of shareholders  such as banks,  brokers or nominees,  that hold shares for
others who are beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the
basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the shareholders as
representing the total amount  registered in such  shareholders'  names and held
for  the  account  of  beneficial  owners  that  have  not  elected  to  receive
distributions  in cash.  Investors  that own shares  registered in the name of a
bank,   broker  or  other  nominee  should  consult  with  such  nominee  as  to
participation  in the Plan  through  such  nominee,  and may be required to have
their shares registered in their own names in order to participate in the Plan.

The Plan Agent serves as agent for the shareholders in  administering  the Plan.
If the  directors  of the Fund  declare an income  dividend  or a capital  gains
distribution   payable   either  in  the  Fund's   Common   Stock  or  in  cash,
nonparticipants  in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive Common Stock, to be issued by the Fund or purchased by the Plan Agent in
the open  market,  as  provided  below.  If the  market  price  per share on the
valuation  date equals or exceeds  net asset  value per share on that date,  the
Fund  will  issue new  shares to  participants  at net  asset  value;  provided,
however,  that if the net asset  value is less than 95% of the  market  price on
valuation date, then such shares will be issued at 95% of the market price.  The
valuation  date will be the  dividend or  distribution  payment date or, if that
date is not a New York Stock Exchange  trading day, the next  preceding  trading
day. If net asset value exceeds the market price of Fund shares at such time, or
if the Fund  should  declare an income  dividend or capital  gains  distribution
payable only in cash,  the Plan Agent will, as agent for the  participants,  buy
Fund shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for
the  participants'  accounts on, or shortly after,  the payment date. if, before
the Plan Agent has  completed  its  purchases,  the market price exceeds the net
asset value of a Fund share,  the average per share  purchase  price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisition  of fewer  shares than if the  distribution  had been paid in shares
issued by the Fund on the dividend payment date.


                                                                              25

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS (CONTINUED)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

Because of the forgoing  difficulty with respect to open market  purchases,  the
Plan  provides  that if the Plan  Agent is unable to  invest  the full  dividend
amount in open  market  purchases  during the  purchase  period or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase  period,  the Plan Agent
will cease  making  open-market  purchases  and  shareholders  will  receive the
uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at the close of
business on the last purchase date.

Participants  have the option of making  additional  cash  payments  to the Plan
Agent, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000, for investment in the Fund's
Common Stock. The Plan Agent will use all such funds received from  participants
to purchase Fund shares in the open market on or about February 15.

Any voluntary cash payment received more than 30 days prior to this date will be
returned by the Plan Agent, and interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
payment. To avoid unnecessary cash  accumulations,  and also to allow ample time
for receipt and processing by the Plan Agent, it is suggested that  participants
send in voluntary  cash payments to be received by the Plan Agent  approximately
ten days before an applicable  purchase date specified  above. A participant may
withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written  notice,  if the notice is received
by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

The Plan Agent  maintains  all  shareholder  accounts in the Plan and  furnishes
written  confirmations of all transactions in an account,  including information
needed by  shareholders  for personal and tax records.  Shares in the account of
each  Plan  participant  will be  held  by the  Plan  Agent  in the  name of the
participant,  and each  shareholder's  proxy will include those shares purchased
pursuant to the Plan.

There is no charge to participants  for  reinvesting  dividends or capital gains
distributions  or  voluntary  cash  payments.  The  Plan  Agent's  fees  for the
reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions  and voluntary  cash
payments  will be paid by the Fund.  There  will be no  brokerage  charges  with
respect  to  shares  issued  directly  by the Fund as a result of  dividends  or
capital gains distributions  payable either in stock or in cash.  However,  each
participant  will pay a pro rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred  with
respect  to the Plan  Agent's  open  market  purchases  in  connection  with the
reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions  and voluntary  cash
payments made by the participant. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts
of stock for individual  accounts  through the Plan are expected to be less than
the usual brokerage charges for such  transactions,  because the Plan Agent will
be  purchasing  stock for all  participants  in blocks and  prorating  the lower
commissions thus attainable.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS (CONCLUDED)

The  receipt of  dividends  and  distributions  under the Plan will not  relieve
participants  of any  income  tax  that  may be  payable  on such  dividends  or
distributions.

Experience  under the Plan may indicate that changes in the Plan are  desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to terminate the Plan
as applied to any voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent  to notice of the  termination  sent to  members of the Plan at
least 30 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended by the Fund or the Plan Agent, but (except when necessary or
appropriate  to comply with  applicable  law,  rules or policies of a regulatory
authority) only by at least 30 days' written notice to participants in the Plan.
All  correspondence  concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.
