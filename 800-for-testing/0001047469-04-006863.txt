LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

                                                               February 12, 2004

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

For the year ended December 31, 2003, The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") had an
increase in its net asset value ("NAV"), assuming the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions, of 78.12%, vs. an increase of 83.30% for the Morgan Stanley
Capital International Chile Index.* Based on market price, the Fund had a gain
of 100.72% in 2003 for the shares that trade on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. As a result, the Fund's discount to its NAV fell from 13.59% to 2.62% in
the period.

The Fund had a strong return in absolute terms, buoyed by upward momentum in
Chile's equity market and by good showings from certain holdings, including the
Fund's banking, telecommunications, chemicals and beverage stocks. On the
negative side, relatively speaking, stocks that underperformed included the
Fund's industrial and metals and mining holdings.

THE MARKET: STRONG PERFORMANCE

In response to several positive internal and external developments, the Chilean
equity market performed well during most of 2003. Among the highlights of the
year were:

FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS. Chile signed a free trade agreement with the European
Union in 2002 and a similar agreement with the United States in June 2003. These
two developed markets represent approximately two-thirds of Chile's commercial
exchange. As such, the free trade agreements should result in a major increase
in exports to these markets (Chile is a net exporter) and drive GDP growth in
2004 and beyond. They could also significantly reduce Chile's country risk.

MACRO- AND MICROECONOMIC IMPROVEMENTS. At the macroeconomic level, the economic
recovery continued to gather pace. The Central Bank recently revised its
estimates for GDP growth in 2004 up to a range of between 4.5% and 5.5%. The
trade surplus is generally expected to grow, despite the strengthening of the
Chilean peso, thanks to stronger commodity prices, particularly those of copper
and pulp. The government continued to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal
responsibility by maintaining a balanced budget. Inflation remained negligible.
The local currency was strong. Interest rates remained low and domestic
consumption showed signs of picking up. At the microeconomic level, the news
appeared even better, as corporations reported fourth quarter sales growth of
10%; operating income grew 20%, and net earnings also grew by 20%.

BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA. The regional backdrop was also supportive, with a more
stable economic environment in neighboring Brazil and Argentina, both countries
in which several Chilean companies have significant investments. Brazil, for
example, was able to pass important reforms, including politically sensitive
pension reform. Local interest rates there also declined significantly in 2003
and could fall further. This, in turn, generated substantial interest in that
country's equities. There is still much uncertainty surrounding the future of
Argentina; however, it appeared by year's end that the government might be able
to reach an agreement with the IMF for much needed new loans.

                                        1

IMPROVING GLOBAL ECONOMY. Throughout most of the year, the global economy picked
up steam, supporting commodity prices and encouraging previously risk-averse
investors to return to the emerging markets in search of higher returns than
were available in the developed markets. This trend benefited several emerging
markets, including Chile's.

OUTLOOK: COUNTING ON CONSUMPTION

The major issue confronting Chile in 2004 is how the marked appreciation of the
local currency will affect corporate performance, specifically which companies
stand to prosper the most from a stronger currency and which will not.

On one hand, many exporters would be hindered by a stronger peso, due to
negative translation effects from a weaker dollar. However, because most
exporters have seen their prices rise in line with increasing demand, this may
partially or wholly offset the currency effect, helping companies to avoid an
earnings shortfall. Even so, the uncertain environment for exporters leads us to
assume a cautious position vis-a-vis the export sectors.

We continue to like the electricity sector, especially power-generating
companies. In our view, current installed capacity is insufficient to satisfy
future demand, especially if, as anticipated, Chilean GDP grows by 5% in each of
the next two years. If new plants have to be built to satisfy this demand,
electricity prices will probably have to increase, and generators will likely be
the main beneficiaries.

We are also optimistic on the beverages and the banking sectors. Both could
benefit from domestic consumption growth. We are underweight the telecom sector.
Telecom companies are facing a tariff setting process that will likely result in
some loss of margins for both fixed line providers and mobile providers.

In the retail arena, we are underweight in department stores and supermarkets.
Even though these types of companies could do well if consumption rises, we
believe that current valuations are stretched. During 2004, we believe there
likely will be several IPOs from retail companies.

Respectfully,


/s/ Matthew J.K. Hickman

THE CHILE FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on January 30,
1989 and commenced investment operations on September 27, 1989. The Fund is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company.

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value of the Fund is determined daily as of
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"Exchange") on each day the Exchange is open for business. The Fund's equity
investments are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the
closing price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily
traded at the time of valuation (the "Valuation Time"). If no sales are
reported, equity investments are generally valued at the most recent bid
quotation as of the Valuation Time or at the lowest ask quotation in the case of
a short sale of securities. Debt securities with a remaining maturity greater
than 60 days are valued in accordance with the price supplied by a pricing
service, which may use a matrix, formula or other objective method that takes
into consideration market indices, yield curves and other specific adjustments.
Debt obligations that will mature in 60 days or less are valued on the basis of
amortized cost, which approximates market value, unless the Board of Directors
determines that using this method would not reflect an investment's value.

Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available or whose values have been materially affected by events occurring
before the Fund's Valuation Time, but after the close of the securities primary
market are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors under procedures established by the Board of Directors. At December
31, 2003, the Fund held 2.38% of its net assets in a security valued at fair
value as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors with an aggregate
cost of $4,392,311 and fair value of $3,489,687. The Fund's estimate of fair
value assumes a willing buyer and a willing seller neither acting under a
compulsion to buy or sell. Although this security may be resold in privately
negotiated transactions, the prices realized on such sales could differ from the
price originally paid by the Fund or the current carrying value, and the
difference could be material.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT: The Fund sweeps available cash into a short-term deposit
issued by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Fund's custodian. The short-term
time deposit is a variable rate account classified as a short-term investment.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment transactions are
accounted for on a trade date basis. The cost of investments sold is determined
by use of the specific identification method for both financial reporting and
income tax purposes. Interest income is accrued as earned; dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date.

TAXES: No provision is made for U.S. income or excise taxes as it is the Fund's
intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and to make
the requisite distributions to its shareholders which will be sufficient to
relieve it from all or substantially all U.S. income and excise taxes.

The Fund accrues foreign taxes on realized gains and repatriation taxes in an
amount equal to what the Fund

                                       12
<Page>

would owe if the securities were sold and the proceeds repatriated on the
valuation date as a liability and reduction of realized/unrealized gains. Taxes
on foreign income are recorded when the related income is recorded.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS: The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (I)  market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
          valuation date rate of exchange; and

     (II) purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at
          the relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of
          such transactions.

The Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses on investments in
equity securities which is due to changes in the foreign exchange rates from
that which is due to changes in market prices of equity securities. Accordingly,
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such
securities are included in the reported net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on investment transactions balances.

The Fund reports certain foreign currency related transactions and foreign taxes
withheld on security transactions as components of realized gains for financial
reporting purposes, whereas such foreign currency related transactions are
treated as ordinary income for U.S. income tax purposes.

Net unrealized currency gains or losses from valuing foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are reflected as
a component of net unrealized appreciation/depreciation in value of investments,
and translation of other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies.

Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses represent foreign exchange gains
and losses from transactions in foreign currencies and forward foreign currency
contracts, exchange gains or losses realized between the trade date and
settlement date on security transactions, and the difference between the amounts
of interest and dividends recorded on the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME AND GAINS: The Fund distributes at least annually to
shareholders substantially all of its net investment income and net realized
short-term capital gains, if any. The Fund determines annually whether to
distribute any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized
short-term capital losses, including capital loss carryovers, if any. An
additional distribution may be made to the extent necessary to avoid the payment
of a 4% U.S. federal excise tax. Dividends and distributions to shareholders are
recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.

On December 12, 2003, a distribution in the aggregate amount of $3,853,172,
equal to $0.01 per share from net investment income and $0.37 per share from net
realized long-term capital gains was declared. This distribution was payable on
January 9, 2004 to shareholders of record as of December 23, 2003.

The character of distributions made during the year from net investment income
or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for U.S.
income tax purposes due to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles/tax
differences in the character of income and expense recognition.

OTHER: The Fund may invest in securities of foreign countries and governments
which involve certain risks in addition to those inherent in domestic
investments. Such risks generally include, among others currency risks
(fluctuations in currency exchange rates),

                                       13
<Page>

information risk (key information may be inaccurate or unavailable) and
political risk (expropriation, nationalization or the imposition of capital or
currency controls or punitive taxes). Other risks of investing in foreign
securities include liquidity and valuation risks.

Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

The Chilean securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more
volatile than the major securities markets in the United States. Consequently,
acquisition and disposition of securities by the Fund may be inhibited. A
significant proportion of the aggregate market value of equity securities listed
on the Santiago Exchange are held by a small number of investors and are not
publicly traded. This may limit the number of shares available for acquisition
or disposition by the Fund.

Investments in Chile may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated with investments in the United States, including the possibility of
future political and economic developments and the level of Chilean governmental
supervision and regulation of its securities markets.

The Fund, subject to local investment limitations, may invest up to 20% of its
assets (at the time of commitment) in illiquid equity securities, including
securities of private equity funds (whether in corporate or partnership form)
that invest primarily in emerging markets. When investing through another
investment fund, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses
incurred by the fund, including management fees. Such securities are expected to
be illiquid, which may involve a high degree of business and financial risk and
may result in substantial losses. Because of the current absence of any liquid
trading market for these investments, the Fund may take longer to liquidate
these positions than would be the case for publicly traded securities. Although
these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions, the prices
realized on any such sales could be substantially less than those originally
paid by the Fund or the current carrying values and this difference could be
material. Further, companies whose securities are not publicly traded may not be
subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements applicable
to companies whose securities are publicly traded.

NOTE C. CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Fund is 100,000,000 shares of common stock,
$0.001 par value. Of the 10,139,926 shares outstanding at December 31, 2003,
CSAM owned 14,615 shares.

NOTE D. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

For the year ended December 31, 2003, purchases and sales of securities, other

NOTE E. CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund, together with other funds/portfolios advised by CSAM (collectively,
the "Participating Funds"), participates in a $100 million committed, unsecured,
line of credit facility ("Credit Facility") with Deutsche Bank, A.G. as
administrative agent and syndication agent and State Street Bank and Trust
Company as operations agent for temporary or emergency purposes. Under the terms
of the Credit Facility, the Participating Funds pay an aggregate commitment fee
at a rate of 0.10% per annum on the average unused amount of the Credit
Facility, which is allocated among the Participating Funds in such manner as is
determined by the governing Boards of the Participating Funds. In addition, the
Participating Funds pay interest on borrowings at the Federal Funds rate plus
0.50%. During the year ended December 31, 2003, the Fund had no borrowings under
the Credit Facility.

NOTE F. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, losses
deferred due to wash sales and Post-October losses (as later defined), and
excise tax regulations.

                                       15

The tax character of dividends and distributions paid during the years ended
December 31, for the Fund were as follows:

At December 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis,
for the Fund were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                     <C>
Undistributed ordinary income           $       629,107
Accumulated net realized gain                 2,904,897
Unrealized appreciation                      62,257,415
                                        ---------------
Total distributable earnings            $    65,791,419
                                        ===============
</Table>

Under current tax law, certain capital losses realized after October 31 within a
taxable year may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the
following tax year ("Post-October losses"). For the tax period ended December
31, 2003, the Fund did not incur Post-October losses.

At December 31, 2003, the identified cost for federal income tax purposes, as
well as the gross unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost, gross unrealized depreciation from
investments for those securities having an excess of cost over value and the net
unrealized appreciation from investments were $88,826,422, $64,898,568,
$(2,616,560) and $62,282,008, respectively.

At December 31, 2003, the Fund reclassified from accumulated net realized gain
on investments and foreign currency related transactions of $28,739 to
undistributed net investment income. In addition, the Fund reclassified $135 of
non-deductible expenses from undistributed net investment income to paid-in
capital, to adjust for current period permanent book/tax differences. Net assets
were not affected by these reclassifications.

NOTE G. SELF-TENDER OFFER

On November 27, 2001, the Fund's Board of Directors approved a tender offer to
acquire up to 25% of the outstanding shares of the Fund's common stock at a per
share cash purchase price equal to 95% of the Fund's net asset value as of the
expiration date of the tender offer period. The Board's actions were taken in
light of the significant discounts at which the Fund's shares were trading. On
January 4, 2002, the Fund commenced a tender offer to acquire up to 25% of its
outstanding shares of common stock at a per share cash purchase price equal to
95% of net asset value per share as of February 4, 2002, the day the offer
expired. Upon expiration of the offer, the Fund accepted for payment 3,379,976
shares of common stock of the Fund at a price of $9.02 per share.

NOTE H. CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Fund may provide general indemnifications
pursuant to certain contracts and organizational documents. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is dependent on future claims that may be made
against the Fund and, therefore, cannot be estimated; however, based on
experience, the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of The Chile Fund, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
at December 31, 2003, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,
and the financial highlights for each of the ten years in the period then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the
United States of America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at December 31, 2003 by
correspondence with the custodian and issuers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

The Fund is required by Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, to advise its shareholders within 60 days of the Fund's year end
(December 31, 2003) as to the U.S. federal tax status of dividends and
distributions received by the Fund's shareholders in respect of such year. Of
the $0.45 per share distribution paid in respect of such year, $0.08 per share
was derived from net investment income and $0.37 per share was derived from net
realized long-term capital gains.

Of the $0.08 per share ordinary income dividend, $0.006 per share represents
qualifying dividend income, which is subject to a maximum tax rate of 15%.
Please note that to utilize the lower tax rate for qualifying dividend income,
shareholders must have held their shares in the Fund for 60 days or more.

Of the $0.37 per share of long-term capital gain distribution, $0.05 per share
was derived from pre-May 6, 2003 gains and $0.32 per share was derived from post
May 5, 2003 gains. The entire amount of the pre-May 6, 2003 long-term capital
gain distribution is from qualified 5-year gains.

There were no distributions which qualified for the dividend received deduction
available to corporate shareholders.

The Fund does not intend to make an election under Section 853 to pass through
foreign taxes paid by the Fund to its shareholders. This information is given to
meet certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Shareholders should refer to their Form1099-DIV to determine the amount
includable on their respective tax returns for 2003.

Notification for calendar year 2003 was mailed in January 2004. The notification
along with Form 1099-DIV reflects the amount to be used by calendar year
taxpayers on their U.S. federal income tax returns.

Foreign shareholders will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the
amount of the actual ordinary dividends paid by the Fund. They will generally
not be entitled to foreign tax credit or deduction for the withholding taxes
paid by the Fund.

In general, distributions received by tax-exempt recipients (e.g., IRAs and
Keoghs) need not be reported as taxable income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. However, some retirement trusts (e.g., corporate, Keogh and 403(b)(7)
plans) may need this information for their annual information reporting.

Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the
tax consequences of their investment in the Fund.

DESCRIPTION OF INVESTLINK(SM) PROGRAM (UNAUDITED)

The InvestLink(SM) Program is sponsored and administered by EquiServe, L.P., not
by The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"). EquiServe, L.P., will act as program
administrator (the "Program Administrator") of the InvestLink(SM) Program (the
"Program"). The purpose of the Program is to provide existing shareholders with
a simple and convenient way to invest additional funds and reinvest dividends in
shares of the Fund's common stock ("Shares") at prevailing prices, with reduced
brokerage commissions and fees.

In order to participate in the Program, you must be a registered holder of at
least one Share of stock of the Fund. Purchases of Shares with funds from a
participant's cash payment or automatic account deduction will begin on the next
day on which funds are invested. All cash payments must be drawn on a U.S. bank
and payable in U.S. dollars. Checks must be made payable to EquiServe. If a
participant selects the dividend reinvestment option, automatic investment of
dividends generally will begin with the next dividend payable after the Program
Administrator receives his enrollment form. Once in the Program, a person will
remain a participant until he terminates his participation or sells all Shares
held in his Program account, or his account is terminated by the Program
Administrator. A participant may change his investment options at any time by
requesting a new enrollment form and returning it to the Program Administrator.

A participant will be assessed certain charges in connection with his
participation in the Program. All optional cash deposit investments will be
subject to a service charge. Sales processed through the Program will have a
service fee deducted from the net proceeds, after brokerage commissions. In
addition to the transaction charges outlined above, participants will be
assessed per share processing fees (which include brokerage commissions.)
Participants will not be charged any fee for reinvesting dividends.

The number of Shares to be purchased for a participant depends on the amount of
his dividends, cash payments or bank account or payroll deductions, less
applicable fees and commissions, and the purchase price of the Shares. The
investment date for cash payments is the 25th day of each month (or the next
trading day if the 25th is not a trading day). The investment date for dividend
reinvestment is the dividend payment date. The Program Administrator uses
dividends and funds of participants to purchase Shares of the Fund in the open
market. Such purchases will be made by participating brokers as agent for the
participants using normal cash settlement practices. All Shares purchased
through the Program will be allocated to participants as of the settlement date,
which is usually three business days from the purchase date. In all cases,
transaction processing will occur within 30 days of the receipt of funds, except
where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply
with applicable provisions of the Federal Securities laws or when unusual market
conditions make prudent investment impracticable. In the event the Program
Administrator is unable to purchase Shares within 30 days of the receipt of
funds, such funds will be returned to the participants.

The average price of all Shares purchased by the Program Administrator with all
funds received during the time period from two business days preceding any
investment date up to the second business day preceding the next investment date
shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in connection with the
Shares purchased for his account with his funds or dividends received by the
Program Administrator during such time period. The average price of all Shares
sold by the Program Administrator pursuant to sell orders received during such
time period shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in
connection with the Shares sold for his account pursuant to his sell orders
received by the Program Administrator during such time period. All sale requests
having an

                                       20
<Page>

anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are expected to be submitted in
written form. In addition, all sale requests received by the Program
Administrator within thirty (30) days of an address change are expected to be
submitted in written form.

EquiServe L.P., as Program Administrator, administers the Program for
participants, keeps records, sends statements of account to participants and
performs other duties relating to the Program. Each participant in the Program
will receive a statement of his account following each purchase of Shares. The
statements will also show the amount of dividends credited to such participant's
account (if applicable), as well as the fees paid by the participant. In
addition, each participant will receive copies of the Fund's annual and
semi-annual reports to shareholders, proxy statements and, if applicable,
dividend income information for tax reporting purposes.

If the Fund is paying dividends on the Shares, a participant will receive
dividends through the Program for all Shares held on the dividend record date on
the basis of full and fractional Shares held in his account, and for all other
Shares of the Fund registered in his name. The Program Administrator will send
checks to the participants for the amounts of their dividends that are not to be
automatically reinvested at no cost to the participants.

Shares of the Fund purchased under the Program will be registered in the name of
the accounts of the respective participants. Unless requested, the Fund will not
issue to participants certificates for Shares of the Fund purchased under the
Program. The Program Administrator will hold the Shares in book-entry form until
a Program participant chooses to withdraw his Shares or terminate his
participation in the Program. The number of Shares purchased for a participant's
account under the Program will be shown on his statement of account. This
feature protects against loss, theft or destruction of stock certificates.

A participant may withdraw all or a portion of the Shares from his Program
account by notifying the Program Administrator. After receipt of a participant's
request, the Program Administrator will issue to such participant certificates
for the whole Shares of the Fund so withdrawn or, if requested by the
participant, sell the Shares for him and send him the proceeds, less applicable
brokerage commissions, fees, and transfer taxes, if any. If a participant
withdraws all full and fractional Shares in his Program account, his
participation in the Program will be terminated by the Program Administrator. In
no case will certificates for fractional Shares be issued. The Program
Administrator will convert any fractional Shares held by a participant at the
time of his withdrawal to cash.

Participation in any rights offering, dividend distribution or stock split will
be based upon both the Shares of the Fund registered in participants' names and
the Shares (including fractional Shares) credited to participants' Program
accounts. Any stock dividend or Shares resulting from stock splits with respect
to Shares of the Fund, both full and fractional, which participants hold in
their Program accounts and with respect to all Shares registered in their names
will be automatically credited to their accounts.

All Shares of the Fund (including any fractional share) credited to his account
under the Program will be voted as the participant directs. The participants
will be sent the proxy materials for the annual meetings of shareholders. When a
participant returns an executed proxy, all of such Shares will be voted as
indicated. A participant may also elect to vote his Shares in person at the
Shareholders' meeting.

                                       21
<Page>

A participant will receive tax information annually for his personal records and
to help him prepare his U.S. federal income tax return. The automatic
reinvestment of dividends does not relieve him of any income tax which may be
payable on dividends. For further information as to tax consequences of
participation in the Program, participants should consult with their own tax
advisors.

The Program Administrator in administering the Program will not be liable for
any act done in good faith or for any good faith omission to act. However, the
Program Administrator will be liable for loss or damage due to error caused by
its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Shares held in custody by the
Program Administrator are not subject to protection under the Securities
Investors Protection Act of 1970.

The participant should recognize that neither the Fund nor the Program
Administrator can provide any assurance of a profit or protection against loss
on any Shares purchased under the Program. A participant's investment in Shares
held in his Program account is no different than his investment in directly held
Shares in this regard. The participant bears the risk of loss and the benefits
of gain from market price changes with respect to all of his Shares. Neither the
Fund nor the Program Administrator can guarantee that Shares purchased under the
Program will, at any particular time, be worth more or less than their purchase
price. Each participant must make an independent investment decision based on
his own judgment and research.

While the Program Administrator hopes to continue the Program indefinitely, the
Program Administrator reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Program at
any time. It also reserves the right to make modifications to the Program.
Participants will be notified of any such suspension, termination or
modification in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Program. The
Program Administrator also reserves the right to terminate any participant's
participation in the Program at any time. Any question of interpretation arising
under the Program will be determined in good faith by the Program Administrator
and any such good faith determination will be final.

Any interested shareholder may participate in the Program. All other cash
payments or bank account deductions must be at least $100.00, up to a maximum of
$100,000.00 annually. An interested shareholder may join the Program by reading
the Program description, completing and signing the enrollment form and
returning it to the Program Administrator. The enrollment form and information
relating to the Program (including the terms and conditions) may be obtained by
calling the Program Administrator at one of the following telephone numbers:
(800) 730-6001 (U.S. and Canada) or (781) 575-3100 (outside U.S. and Canada).
All correspondence regarding the Program should be directed to: EquiServe Trust
Company N.A., InvestLink(SM) Program, P.O. Box 43010, Providence, RI
02940-3010.

InvestLink is a service mark of EquiServe, L.P.

<Page>

                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

          Introduction

          Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC and CSAM Capital Inc.
(collectively, "CSAM") are fiduciaries that owe each of its clients duties of
care and loyalty with respect to proxy voting. The duty of care requires CSAM to
monitor corporate events and to vote proxies. To satisfy its duty of loyalty,
CSAM must cast proxy votes in the best interests of each of its clients.

          The Credit Suisse Funds, Credit Suisse Institutional Funds, and CSAM
Closed-End Funds (the "Funds"), which have engaged Credit Suisse Asset
Management, LLC as their investment adviser, are of the belief that the proxy
voting process is a means of addressing corporate governance issues and
encouraging corporate actions both of which can enhance shareholder value.

          Policy

          The Proxy Voting Policy (the "Policy") set forth below is designed to
ensure that proxies are voted in the best interests of CSAM's clients. The
Policy addresses particular issues and gives a general indication of how CSAM
will vote proxies. The Policy is not exhaustive and does not include all
potential issues.

          Proxy Voting Committee

          The Proxy Voting Committee will consist of a member of the Portfolio
Management Department, a member of the Legal and Compliance Department, and a
member of the Operations Department (or their designees). The purpose of the
Proxy Voting Committee is to administer the voting of all clients' proxies in
accordance with the Policy. The Proxy Voting Committee will review the Policy
annually to ensure that it is designed to promote the best interests of CSAM's
clients.

          For the reasons disclosed below under "Conflicts," the Proxy Voting
Committee has engaged the services of an independent third party (initially,
Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS")) to assist in issue analysis and vote
recommendation for proxy proposals. Proxy proposals addressed by the Policy will
be voted in accordance with the Policy. Proxy proposals addressed by the Policy
that require a case-by-case analysis will be voted in accordance with the vote
recommendation of ISS. Proxy proposals not addressed by the Policy will also be
voted in accordance with the vote recommendation of ISS. To the extent that the
Proxy Voting Committee proposes to deviate from the Policy or the ISS vote
recommendation, the Committee shall obtain client consent as described below.

          CSAM investment professionals may submit a written recommendation to
the Proxy Voting Committee to vote in a manner inconsistent with the Policy
and/or the recommendation of

<Page>

ISS. Such recommendation will set forth its basis and rationale. In addition,
the investment professional must confirm in writing that he/she is not aware of
any conflicts of interest concerning the proxy matter or provide a full and
complete description of the conflict.

          Conflicts

          CSAM is the institutional and mutual fund asset management arm of
Credit Suisse First Boston, which is part of Credit Suisse Group, one of the
world's largest financial organizations. As part of a global, full service
investment-bank, broker-dealer, and asset-management organization, CSAM and its
affiliates and personnel may have multiple advisory, transactional, financial,
and other interests in securities, instruments, and companies that may be
purchased or sold by CSAM for its clients' accounts. The interests of CSAM
and/or its affiliates and personnel may conflict with the interests of CSAM's
clients in connection with any proxy issue. In addition, CSAM may not be able to
identify all of the conflicts of interest relating to any proxy matter.

          Consent

          In each and every instance in which the Proxy Voting Committee favors
voting in a manner that is inconsistent with the Policy or the vote
recommendation of ISS (including proxy proposals addressed and not addressed by
the Policy), it shall disclose to the client conflicts of interest information
and obtain client consent to vote. Where the client is a Fund, disclosure shall
be made to any one director who is not an "interested person," as that term is
defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, of the Fund.

          Recordkeeping

          CSAM is required to maintain in an easily accessible place for five
years all records relating to proxy voting.

          These records include the following:

          a copy of the Policy;

          a copy of each proxy statement received on behalf of CSAM clients;

          a record of each vote cast on behalf of CSAM clients;

          a copy of all documents created by CSAM personnel that were material
to making a decision on a vote or that memorializes the basis for the decision;
and

          a copy of each written request by a client for information on how CSAM
voted proxies, as well as a copy of any written response.

          CSAM reserves the right to maintain certain required proxy records
with ISS in accordance with all applicable regulations.

<Page>

          Disclosure

          CSAM will describe the Policy to each client. Upon request, CSAM will
provide any client with a copy of the Policy. CSAM will also disclose to its
clients how they can obtain information on their proxy votes.

          ISS will capture data necessary for Funds to file Form N-PX on an
annual basis concerning their proxy voting record in accordance with applicable
law.

          Procedures

          The Proxy Voting Committee will administer the voting of all client
proxies. CSAM has engaged ISS as an independent third party proxy voting service
to assist in the voting of client proxies. ISS will coordinate with each
client's custodian to ensure that proxy materials reviewed by the custodians are
processed in a timely fashion. ISS will provide CSAM with an analysis of proxy
issues and a vote recommendation for proxy proposals. ISS will refer proxies to
the Proxy Voting Committee for instructions when the application of the Policy
is not clear. The Proxy Voting Committee will notify ISS of any changes to the
Policy or deviating thereof.

          Proposals to reduce quorum requirements for shareholder meetings below
a majority of the shares outstanding will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

          Amend Minor Bylaws

          Generally vote for bylaw or charter changes that are of a housekeeping
nature.

          Change Date, Time, or Location of Annual Meeting

          Generally vote for management proposals to change the
date/time/location of the annual meeting unless the proposed change is

date/time/location of the annual meeting unless the current scheduling or
location is unreasonable.

          Ratify Auditors

<Page>

          Generally vote for proposals to ratify auditors unless: (1) an auditor
has a financial interest in or association with the company, and is therefore
not independent; (2) fees for non-audit services are excessive, or (3) there is
reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an opinion, which is
neither accurate nor indicative of the company's financial position. Generally
vote on a case-by-case basis on shareholder proposals asking companies to
prohibit their auditors from engaging in non-audit services (or capping the
level of non-audit services). Generally vote on a case-by-case basis on auditor
rotation proposals taking into consideration: (1) tenure of audit firm; (2)
establishment and disclosure of a renewal process whereby the auditor is
regularly evaluated for both audit quality and competitive price; (3) length of

issues.

may be withheld: (1) from directors who attended less than 75% of the board and
committee meetings without a valid reason for the absences; (2) implemented or
renewed a dead-hand poison pill; (3) ignored a shareholder proposal that was
approved by a majority of the votes cast for two consecutive years; (4) ignored
a shareholder proposal approved by a majority of the shares outstanding; (5)
have failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of the shareholders
have tendered their shares; (6) are inside directors or affiliated outside
directors and sit on the audit, compensation, or nominating committee; (7) are
inside directors or affiliated outside directors and the full board serves as
the audit, compensation, or nominating committee or the company does not have
one of these committees; or (8) are audit committee members and the non-audit
fees paid to the auditor are excessive

          Cumulative Voting

          Proposals to eliminate cumulative voting will be determined on a
case-by-case basis. Proposals to restore or provide for cumulative voting in the
absence of sufficient good governance provisions and/or poor relative
shareholder returns will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

          Director and Officer Indemnification and Liability Protection

          Proposals on director and officer indemnification and liability
protection generally evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Generally vote against
proposals that would: (1) eliminate entirely directors' and officers' liability
for monetary damages for violating the duty of care; or (2) expand coverage
beyond just legal expenses to acts, such as negligence, that are more serious
violations of fiduciary obligation than mere carelessness. Generally vote for
only those proposals providing such expanded coverage in cases when a director's
or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if: (1) the director was found to
have acted in good faith and in a manner that he reasonably believed was in the
best interests of the company, and (2) only if the director's legal expenses
would be covered.

vacancies.

          Independent Chairman (Separate Chairman/CEO)

          Generally vote for shareholder proposals requiring the position of
chairman be filled by an independent director unless there are compelling
reasons to recommend against the proposal, including: (1) designated lead
director, elected by and from the independent board members with clearly
delineated duties; (2) 2/3 independent board; (3) all independent key
committees; or (4) established governance guidelines.

          Majority of Independent Directors

          Generally vote for shareholder proposals requiring that the board
consist of a majority or substantial majority (two-thirds) of independent
directors unless the board composition already meets the adequate threshold.
Generally vote for shareholder proposals requiring the board audit,
compensation, and/or nominating committees be composed exclusively of
independent directors if they currently do not meet that standard. Generally
withhold votes from insiders and affiliated outsiders sitting on the audit,
compensation, or nominating committees. Generally withhold votes from insiders
and affiliated outsiders on boards that are lacking any of these three panels.

outside directors.

          Proxy Contests

          Voting on Director Nominees in Contested Elections

          Votes in a contested election of directors should be decided on a
case-by-case basis, with shareholders determining which directors are best
suited to add value for shareholders. The major decision factors are: (1)
company performance relative to its peers; (2) strategy of the incumbents versus
the dissidents; (3) independence of directors/nominees; (4) experience and
skills of board candidates; (5) governance profile of the company; (6) evidence
of management entrenchment; (7) responsiveness to shareholders; or (8) whether
takeover offer has been rebuffed.

adopt confidential voting, use independent vote tabulators and use independent
inspectors of election, as long as the proposal includes a provision for proxy
contests as follows: In the case of a contested election, management should be
permitted to request that the dissident group honor its confidential voting
policy. If the dissidents agree, the policy may remain in place. If the
dissidents will not agree, the confidential voting policy may be waived.
Generally vote for management proposals to adopt confidential voting.

          Cumulative Voting

CODE OF ETHICS

                               CREDIT SUISSE FUNDS

                        CREDIT SUISSE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS

                         CREDIT SUISSE CLOSED-END FUNDS

                       CODE OF ETHICS FOR SENIOR OFFICERS

PREAMBLE

          Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 directs that rules be
adopted disclosing whether a company has a code of ethics for senior financial
officers. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has adopted rules
requiring annual disclosure of an investment company's code of ethics applicable
to the company's principal executive as well as principal financial officers, if
such a code has been adopted. In response, the above Funds (each a "Fund", and
together the "Funds") have adopted this Code of Ethics.

STATEMENT OF POLICY

          It is the obligation of the senior officers of the Funds to provide
full, fair, timely and comprehensible disclosure--financial and otherwise--to
Fund shareholders, regulatory authorities and the general public. In fulfilling
that obligation, senior officers must act ethically, honestly and diligently.
This Code is intended to enunciate guidelines to be followed by persons who
serve the Funds in senior officerships. No Code can address every situation that
a senior officer might face; however, as a guiding principle, senior officers
should strive to implement the spirit as well as the

<Page>

letter of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to provide the type of
clear and complete disclosure and information Fund shareholders have a right to
expect.

          The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to promote high standards of
ethical conduct by Covered Persons (as defined below) in their capacities as
officers of the Funds, to instruct them as to what is considered to be
inappropriate and unacceptable conduct or activities for officers and to
prohibit such conduct or activities. This Code supplements other policies that
the Funds and their adviser have adopted or may adopt in the future with which
Fund officers are also required to comply (e.g., code of ethics relating to
personal trading and conduct).

COVERED PERSONS

          This Code of Ethics applies to those persons appointed by the Fund's
Board of Directors as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, or persons performing similar functions.
It is recognized that each of such persons currently is a full-time employee of
Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC ("CSAM"), each Fund's investment adviser.

PROMOTION OF HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT

          In serving as an officer of the Funds, each Covered Person must
maintain high standards of honesty and ethical conduct and must encourage his
colleagues who provide services to the Funds, whether directly or indirectly, to
do the same.

          Each Covered Person understands that as an officer of a Fund, he has a
duty to act in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The
interests of other CSAM clients or CSAM itself or the Covered

<Page>

Person's personal interests should not be allowed to compromise the Covered
Person's fulfilling his duties as an officer of the Fund. The governing Boards
of the Funds recognize that the Covered Persons are also officers or employees
of CSAM. Furthermore, the governing Boards of the Funds recognize that, subject
to the Covered Person's fiduciary duties to the Funds, the Covered Persons will
in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Funds or for
CSAM, or for both) be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on CSAM and the Funds. The governing
Boards of the Funds recognize that the participation of the Covered Persons in
such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Funds
and CSAM and/or its affiliates, and is consistent with the expectation of the
governing Boards of the performance by the Covered Persons of their duties as
officers of the Funds.

          If a Covered Person believes that his responsibilities as an officer
or employee of CSAM are likely to materially compromise his objectivity or his
ability to perform the duties of his role as an officer of the Funds, he should
consult with CSAM's general counsel, the Funds' chief legal officer or outside
counsel, or counsel to the independent Directors/Trustees of the relevant Fund
or Funds. Under appropriate circumstances, a Covered Person should also consider
whether to present the matter to the Directors/Trustees of the relevant Fund or
Funds or a committee thereof.

          No Covered Person shall suggest that any person providing, or
soliciting to be retained to provide, services to a Fund give a gift or an
economic benefit of any kind to him in connection with the person's retention or
the provision of services.

PROMOTION OF FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY AND UNDERSTANDABLE DISCLOSURE

<Page>

          No Covered Person shall create or further the creation of false or
misleading information in any SEC filing or report to Fund shareholders. No
Covered Person shall conceal or fail to disclose information within the Covered
Person's possession legally required to be disclosed or necessary to make the
disclosure made not misleading. If a Covered Person shall become aware that
information filed with the SEC or made available to the public contains any
false or misleading information or omits to disclose necessary information, he
shall promptly report it to CSAM's general counsel or Fund counsel, who shall
advise such Covered Person whether corrective action is necessary or
appropriate.

          Each Covered Person, consistent with his responsibilities, shall
exercise appropriate supervision over, and shall assist, relevant Fund service
providers in developing financial information and other disclosure that complies
with relevant law and presents information in a clear, comprehensible and
complete manner. Each Covered Person shall use his best efforts within his area
of expertise to assure that Fund reports reveal, rather than conceal, the
relevant Fund's financial condition.

          Each Covered Person shall seek to obtain additional resources if he
believes that available resources are inadequate to enable the Funds to provide
full, fair and accurate financial information and other disclosure to regulators
and Fund shareholders.

          Each Covered Person shall inquire of other Fund officers and service
providers, as appropriate, to assure that information provided is accurate and
complete and presented in an understandable format using comprehensible
language.

<Page>

          Each Covered Person shall diligently perform his services to the
Funds, so that information can be gathered and assessed early enough to
facilitate timely filings and issuance of reports and required certifications.

PROMOTION OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE GOVERNMENT LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

          Each Covered Person shall become and remain knowledgeable concerning
the laws and regulations relating to the Funds and their operations and shall
act with competence and due care in serving as an officer of the Funds. Each
Covered Person with specific responsibility for financial statement disclosure
will become and remain knowledgeable concerning relevant auditing standards,
generally accepted accounting principles, FASB pronouncements and other
accounting and tax literature and developments.

          Each Covered Person shall devote sufficient time to fulfilling his
responsibilities to the Funds, recognizing that he will devote substantial time
to providing services to other CSAM clients and will perform other activities as
an employee of CSAM.

          Each Covered Person shall cooperate with a Fund's independent
auditors, regulatory agencies and internal auditors in their review or
inspection of the Fund and its operations.

          No Covered Person shall knowingly violate any law or regulation
relating to the Funds or their operations or seek to illegally circumvent any
such law or regulation.

          No Covered Person shall engage in any conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit or misrepresentation involving the Funds or their operations.

PROMOTING PROMPT INTERNAL REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS

<Page>

          Each Covered Person shall promptly report his own violations of this
Code and violations by other Covered Persons of which he is aware to the
Chairman of the relevant Fund's Audit Committee.

          Any requests for a waiver from or an amendment to this Code shall be
made to the Chairman of the relevant Fund's Audit Committee. All waivers and
amendments shall be disclosed as required by law.

SANCTIONS

          Failure to comply with this Code will subject the violator to
appropriate sanctions, which will vary based on the nature and severity of the
violation. Such sanctions may include censure, suspension or termination of
position as an officer of the Fund. Sanctions shall be imposed by the relevant
Fund's Audit Committee, subject to review by the entire Board of
Directors/Trustees of the Fund.

          Each Covered Person shall be required to certify annually whether he
has complied with this Code.

NO RIGHTS CREATED

          This Code of Ethics is a statement of certain fundamental principles,
policies and procedures that govern the Funds' senior officers in the conduct of
the Funds' business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights in any
employee, investor, supplier, competitor, shareholder or any other person or
entity.

RECORDKEEPING

<Page>

          The Funds will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six
(6) years from the date such action is taken, the first two (2) years in an
easily accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the
Board (1) that provided the basis for any amendment or waiver to this Code and
(2) relating to any violation of the Code and sanctions imposed for such
violation, together with a written record of the approval or action taken by the
relevant Board.

AMENDMENTS

          The Directors/Trustees will make and approve such changes to this Code
of Ethics as they deem necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of
this Code.
