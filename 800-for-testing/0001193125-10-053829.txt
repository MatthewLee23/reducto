               FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MANAGED DISTRIBUTION PLAN

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10% of the Fund's net asset
value on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent earnings from net
investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary, return of capital.
The board believes that regular monthly, fixed cash payouts will enhance
shareholder value and serve the long-term interests of shareholders. You should
not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the
amount of the distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Managed
Distribution Plan.

   The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains in the fiscal year to date; therefore, a portion of your
distributions may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for
example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid
back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the
Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield" or
"income".

   The amounts and sources of distributions reported in Section 19(a) notices
of the 1940 Act are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting
purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting
purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder
of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The
Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will
tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.

   The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Managed Distribution Plan at
any time, without prior notice to shareholders if it deems such action to be in
the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

DEAR FELLOW ZTR SHAREHOLDER:

   I am pleased to share with you the manager's report and commentary for The
Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. for the fiscal ended December 31, 2009.

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value increased 2.95% for the
quarter ended December 31, 2009, including $0.103 in reinvested distributions.
During the same period the Fund's Composite Index increased 2.51%, including
reinvested dividends. The Fund's average exposure for the quarter was
approximately 40% in equities and 39% in bonds.

   For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, the Fund's net asset value
gained 15.46%, including $0.396 in reinvested distributions. During the same
period the Fund's Composite Index increased 11.85%, including reinvested
dividends. The Fund's average exposure for the fiscal year was approximately
39% in equities and 43% in bonds.

          Sincerely,

          /s/ George R. Aylward
          George R. Aylward
          President, Chairman and
          Chief Executive Officer
          The Zweig Total Return
          Fund, Inc.

                          MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

   It was famine and feast for the stock market in 2009, capping one of the
most volatile decades in financial history. Following a steep slump early in
the year, the major indexes rebounded strongly to achieve their best year on a
percentage basis since 2003.

   Rising 15%/(1)/ in the fourth quarter, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
ended 2009 at 10,428, marking a gain of 18.8%/(1)/. This was an increase of
59%/(1)/ from its 12-year low touched on March 9, but still 26%/(1)/ below its
record close of 16,164 on October 9, 2007. For the decade, the Dow lost
9.3%/(1)/.

   The S&P 500 Index, which gained 15%/(1)/ in the final quarter, closed the
year at 1,115.10, up 65%/(1)/ from its March low, and an increase of 23.5%/(1)/
for 2009. The index slipped 24.1%/(1)/ for the decade.

   The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which was hardest hit by the bursting
of the dot-com bubble, rose 15.5%/(1)/ in the last quarter and surged
43.9%/(1)/ for the year. It was the largest annual point gain since 1999 and
the second greatest point rise in its history. However, it still left the
Nasdaq down 44.2%/(1)/ for the past 10 years.

   Last year was also comeback time for world markets. Excluding the U.S., the
Dow Jones World Index climbed nearly 40%/(1)/ in dollar terms for 2009. China's
Shanghai Composite exploded 80%/(1)/ and Japan's Nikkei Stock Average of 225
companies gained 19%/(1)/. In Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 22.1%/(1)/ and
Germany's DAX Index was up 23.8%/(1)/.
- --------
(1) Return excludes reinvested dividends.


 Managed Distribution Plan: The Fund has a policy to distribute 10% of its net
 asset value annually. Please see the inside front cover for more details.

Back at home, Federal Reserve (the "Fed") Chairman Ben Bernanke said he
expected "moderate" economic growth in 2010 but cautioned that it "would be at
a pace slower than we would like." While conceding that the economy faced
"formidable headwinds," he said he saw no signs of a bubble. Mr. Bernanke also
said low inflation and the economy's slack warranted keeping today's
"exceptionally low interest rates for an extended period." He later warned that
at some point as "the economic recovery takes hold, the Fed will need to
tighten policy to prevent the emerging of an inflation problem down the road."

   Although there was an uptick in consumer prices in November, that inflation
component still seems tame. The Labor Department reported that consumer prices
edged up a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in November after an 0.3% rise in October.
Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the November core inflation
rate was unchanged from the previous month. At the same time, the Commerce
Department reported that consumer spending increased moderately in November,
going up just 0.2% on an inflation adjusted basis. Wholesale prices climbed
1.8% in November after a 0.3% gain in October. That core rate was up 0.5%, the
largest monthly increase in over a year.

   The Fed reported that industrial production increased 0.8% in November from
the previous month. It also noted that the rate by which industries used their
available capacity increased to 71.3% from a revised 70.67% in October. The Fed
also reported that third - quarter worker productivity was not as strong as
previously reported. While the annual rate dipped to 8.13% from the formerly
reported 9.5% estimate, it was still the highest figure in six years.

   Another revised estimate revealed that the U.S. economy grew more slowly
than previously reported. The Commerce Department said that the nation's gross
domestic product of goods and services (GDP) increased at a 2.8% annual rate in
the third quarter instead of its earlier projection of 3.5%. However it was
still the first increase since the second quarter of 2008.

   The housing market, a key component of the economy, is presenting a mixed
picture. The Commerce Department reported that new home construction increased
8.9% in November on a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 574,000 units, while
the Census Bureau said new home sales tumbled 11.3% that month. Meanwhile, the
National Association of Realtors announced that sales of existing homes
increased 7.4% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 6.54 million units - the
highest level since February 2007.

   Upbeat economic news came from the Institute for Supply Management ("ISM")
which reported that its index of manufacturing activity rose to 55.9 in
December from 53.6 in November, to the highest reading since April 2006. Any
score above 50 indicates expansion. Bullish sentiment was echoed by the
Conference Board, which said its index of leading economic indicators gained
0.9% in November following a 0.3% rise in October.

   Less positive was the news from the employment front. The Commerce
Department reported that another 85,000 jobs were cut in December, bringing the
total job loss to 7.2 million since the recession began in December 2007. While
the unemployment rate of 10% was unchanged from November, it was only because
many workers stopped looking for jobs that month and thus weren't counted.

   Growth prospects for the fourth quarter were heightend by the Commerce
Department report that the U.S. trade deficit narrowed in October to $32.9
billion. Exports rose 2.6%, its sixth straight monthly increase, while imports
gained only 0.4%. The weaker dollar has helped to spur exports. Tracked against
a basket of sixteen other currencies the dollar ended 2009 down 5%, according
to the J.P. Morgan Chase Index. For the year, the dollar declined 2.94% against
the euro and increased 2.6% against the yen.

   Merger and acquisition deal volume in the U.S. fell 10% in 2009 to $766.8
billion from $850.6 billion in 2008, according to Dealogic. There were 7,140
U.S. deals last year, a drop of 17% from the 8,614 a year earlier. Global
activity also declined, with deal volume totaling $2.3 trillion in 2009, off
22% from $2.94 trillion in 2008 and the lowest volume since $1.98 trillion in
2004.

   There was a great disparity in global initial public offerings ("IPO") of
stocks in 2009 with Asia taking the lion's share by far, according to Dealogic.
China alone completed 185 deals totaling $50.5 billion, over double the amount
completed in the U.S. and Europe combined. The U.S. achieved 49 deals totaling
$16.7 billion while Europe had 69 deals valued at only $7.7 billion. While the
global number of IPOs last year declined 15% to 583, the dollar volume
increased 50% over 2008 to $114.7 billion.

   Looking to the future, companies in the S&P 500 Index are expected to earn
$77.84 a share in 2010, an increase of about 30% over last year, according to
Thomson Financial. The less optimistic Wall Street Journal consensus survey
forecast a 21% gain to $72.62 a share.

   Based on these earning forecasts for 2010, Bloomberg News reported that
stocks in the S&P 500 Index were trading at a price/earnings ratio of 14.18 at
the year end against 13.98 on September 30 and 11.34 at the close of 2008.
These figures compare with an average P/E ratio of 14.9 dating back to 1984.
For trailing twelve-month earnings, the ratios were 24.52, 19.56, and 18.8
respectively. To us, these valuations seem about fairly priced. They are not
cheap but they are also not widely out of line.

   Following a dismal year, companies are expected to increase their dividend
payments by 6.1% for 2010, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index
analyst at Standard and Poor's. Mr. Silverblatt believes that "the dividend
recovery will be slow" and that it will take until 2012 to 2013 to return to
where we were. Last year 804 companies cut dividends against 110 two years ago
and was at the highest level since the S&P began collecting data in 1955. The
number of dividend increases fell 36.4% to a record low.

   As far as the market outlook is concerned, analysts are far more optimistic
than individual investors. Surveyed by Investors Intelligence, analysts tallied
52% bulls and 17% bears at the year end. At the same time, the American
Institute of Investors reported that its members were evenly split, with 38%
bulls and 38% bears. Our viewpoint is somewhere between the investors and the
analysts. The public is gun shy. They have been selling domestic stock mutual
funds and buying bond funds. Analysts, meanwhile, are optimistic because
interest rates are still low and the tape has been performing pretty well.

   We think that the economy turned around about six months ago and earnings
will be higher than most people expect. Corporations have cut a lot of fat from
their operations and if, or as, the economy turns up, profit margins will be
quite high, which is bullish for the market.

   One factor that is making us somewhat nervous right now is the highly
optimistic sentiment indicators. However, as the old saying goes, the bull
market has to climb a wall of worry and there is always plenty to worry about.
There will be a correction at some point but it doesn't necessarily have to be
a big one. On the whole, today's equity market looks positive.

                                  BOND MARKET

   Last year was generally tough for government bonds. Yields on the benchmark
10-year Treasury Note increased from 2.21% at the beginning of 2009 to 3.84% at
the close. (Yields move in the opposite direction from price -- when bond
yields rise, bond prices fall.) The high yield for the year was reached on June
10 when the 10-year hit 3.95%.

   The second half of the year saw modest gains in Treasury bond portfolios
(including coupons yields and interest). The improvements were made primarily
in corporate bonds of lower credit ratings. After the S&P touched bottom in
early March, investors were willing to buy riskier assets.

   Treasury Inflation Protected Securities ("TIPS") also outperformed standard
Treasury Notes for the year. That is because some investors viewed the easy Fed
money policy, combined with increased fiscal deficits, as potentially
inflationary. Once the stock market stabilized and eventually started to move
higher, investors saw fewer reasons to own U.S. Government debt, with its low
yields and safe haven status.

   The so-called "flight to quality" from 2008 and early 2009 reversed and
Treasuries did poorly. With the Federal Funds Rates at a zero to 25 basis
points (effectively a zero percent overnight inter-bank interest rate) and with
yields further out in time, the so-called "yield curve" is about as steep as it
has ever been. This reflects worry about possible future inflation and a higher
level of government borrowing. Both factors are negative for government bond
holders.

   Corporate bonds, on the other hand, had a huge risk premium priced in at the
beginning of the year, reflecting mass concern about a possible
"Armageddon" -- a total meltdown of our financial system. As these fears
abated, asset prices rose and corporate bonds climbed with them. The spread
over the "risk free" rate of return for government bonds narrowed and bond
holders and credit product positions profited nicely.

   Our bond portfolio reflects our view that both TIPS and corporate bonds
would do better this year than Treasury notes and bonds. While the Fund has
rarely owned non-AAA paper, our managers viewed the opportunity early in 2009
as unique and invested in several lower grade investment bond names. That
decision, combined with owning TIPS and keeping a low duration (a measure of
sensitivity to interest rates) in other Treasury securities, helped provide
solid performance for our bond portfolio. At this writing, our portfolio
remains at a low relative duration, with a high percentage of TIPS and less
credit exposure than we held two months ago.

          Sincerely,

          /s/Martin E. Zweig, Ph.D.

(1)Closing Price -- New York Stock Exchange.
(2)Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of a share of the
   Fund's common stock at the opening NYSE share price on the first business
   day and a sale at the closing NYSE share price on the last business day of
   each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
   the purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
   the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Generally, total
   investment return based on net asset value will be higher than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is an
   increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value to
   the net assets from the beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely,
   total investment return based on net asset value will be lower than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is a decrease
   in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net
   asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.

(4)Shares were sold at a 5% discount from a 5-day average market price from
   5/14/07 to 5/18/07.
(5)Total investment return includes the dilutive effect of the rights offering.
   Without this effect, the total investment return would have been (13.82)%.
(6)Amount is less than $0.005.
(7)NAV return is calculated using the opening Net Asset Value price of the
   Fund's common stock on the first business day and the closing Net Asset
   Value price of the Fund's common stock on the last business day of each
   period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for the
   purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
   Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                               DECEMBER 31, 2009

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988. The Fund's investment objective is to seek the
highest total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income,
consistent with the preservation of capital.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates and those differences could be significant.

  A. SECURITY VALUATION:

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price.

   Debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or valuations
provided by a pricing service, which utilizes information with respect to
recent sales, market transactions in comparable securities, quotations from
dealers, and various relationships between securities in determining value. Due
to the continued volatility in the current market, valuations developed through
pricing techniques may materially vary from the actual amounts realized upon
sale of the securities.

   As required, some securities and other assets may be valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Directors.

   Certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where closing
prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily
available market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement in
the U.S. securities market, or other regional and local developments) may occur
between the time that foreign markets close (where the security is principally
traded) and the time that the Fund calculates its net asset value (generally,
the close of the NYSE) that may impact the value of securities traded in these
foreign markets. In these cases, information from an external vendor may be
utilized to adjust closing market prices of certain foreign common stocks to
reflect their fair value. Because the frequency of significant events is not
predictable, fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a
frequent basis.

                                      17

<PAGE>



   Investments in underlying funds are valued at each fund's closing net asset
value determined as of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).

   Short-term investments having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market.

   The Fund utilizes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:

   .   Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

   .   Level 2 -- prices determined using other significant observable inputs
       (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,
       prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)

   .   Level 3 -- prices determined using significant unobservable inputs
       (including the Fund's own assumptions in determining the fair value of
       investments)

   A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's net assets by each major
security type is disclosed at the end of the Schedule of Investments. The
inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

  B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INCOME:

   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign securities,
as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest income is recorded on the accrual
basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the effective
interest method. Realized gains and losses are determined on the identified
cost basis.

  C. INCOME TAXES:

   The Fund is treated as a separate taxable entity. It is the policy of the
Fund to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes or excise taxes
has been made.

   The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on investments or
currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable. The Fund will
accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon current
interpretations of the tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

   Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, sets forth a minimum threshold
for financial statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. Management has analyzed the Fund's tax
positions and has concluded that no provision for income tax is required in the
Fund's financial statements. The Fund is unaware of any tax positions for which
it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits
will significantly change in the next twelve months. Each of the Fund's federal
tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remains subject to examination by
the Internal Revenue Service.

                                      18

  D. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

   Distributions are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These differences may include the treatment of
non-taxable dividends, market premium and discount, non-deductible expenses,
expiring capital loss carryovers, foreign currency gain or loss, operating
losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. Permanent book and tax basis
differences relating to shareholder distributions will result in
reclassifications to capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest.

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10 percent of the Fund's net
asset value ("NAV") on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent
earnings from net investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary,
return of capital. Shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the
Fund's investment performance from the terms of the Fund's Managed Distribution
Plan. As noted in the Statement of Changes, the Fund distributed a return of
capital.

  E. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:

   Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from changes
in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market prices of
securities.

NOTE 3 -- INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

($ REPORTED IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED)

   Virtus Investment Advisers, Inc. ("VIA" the "Adviser") is an indirect

   A) INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE: The Investment Advisory Agreement (the
"Agreement") between the Adviser and the Fund provides that, subject to the
direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund and the applicable provisions
of the Act, the adviser is responsible for the actual management of the Fund's

particular investment rests with the Adviser, subject to review by the Board of
Directors and the applicable provisions of the Act. For the services provided
by the Adviser under the Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee
equal, on an annual basis to 0.70% of the Fund's average daily net assets.
During the fiscal year (the "period") ended December 31, 2009, the Fund
incurred advisory fees of $3,180.

   Zweig Consulting LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), which serves as the Sub-Adviser

</TABLE>

NOTE 5 -- INDEMNIFICATIONS

   Under the Fund's organizational documents and related agreements, its
directors and officers are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out
of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, the Fund enters
into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these arrangements.

NOTE 6 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   At December 31, 2009, the Fund had one class of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of which 500,000,000 shares are authorized and 114,594,744
shares are outstanding.

   Registered shareholders may elect to have all distributions paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder by Computershare as dividend paying agent.
Pursuant to the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders not making such election will have all such amounts automatically
reinvested by Computershare, as the Plan agent, in whole or fractional shares
of the Fund, as the case may be. During the periods ended December 31, 2009 and
December 31, 2008, there were no shares issued pursuant to the Plan.

                                      20

<PAGE>



   In a non-transferable rights offering ended May 18, 2007, shareholders
exercised rights to purchase 20,730,142 shares of common stock at an offering
price of $4.98 per share for proceeds, net of expenses, of $102,586,107.
Expenses were adjusted by $15,058 in 2008, resulting in final net proceeds of
$102,571,049.

   On December 21, 2009, the Fund announced a distribution of $0.034 per share
to shareholders of record on December 31, 2009. This distribution has an
ex-dividend date of January 5, 2010, and is payable on January 11, 2010. Please
see inside front cover for more information on fund distributions.

NOTE 7 -- CREDIT RISK AND ASSET CONCENTRATIONS

   In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may present
greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments
may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in
these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these
investments and the income they generate, as well as the Fund's ability to
repatriate such amounts.

   The Fund may invest a high percentage of its assets in specific sectors of
the market in its pursuit of a greater investment return. Fluctuations in these
sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on the Fund, positive or
negative, than if the Fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors.

NOTE 8 -- REGULATORY EXAMS

   Federal and state regulatory authorities from time to time make inquiries
and conduct examinations regarding compliance by Virtus and its subsidiaries
(collectively "the Company") with securities and other laws and regulations
affecting their registered products.

   There are currently no such matters which the Company believes will be
material to these financial statements.

NOTE 9 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION

($ REPORTED IN THOUSANDS)

   At December 31, 2009, federal tax cost and aggregate gross unrealized
appreciation (depreciation) of securities held by the Fund were as follows:

                                                              NET UNREALIZED
  FEDERAL                                                      APPRECIATION
 TAX COST   UNREALIZED APPRECIATION UNREALIZED DEPRECIATION   (DEPRECIATION)
 ---------  ----------------------- ----------------------- ------------------
 $446,357          $36,036                $(10,536)              $25,500

   The Fund has $9,584 of capital loss carryovers, expiring in 2017, which may
be used to offset future capital gains. The Fund may not realize the benefit of
these losses to the extent it does not realize gains on investments prior to
the expiration of the capital loss carryovers. In addition, under certain
conditions, the Fund may lose the benefit of these losses to the extent that
distributions to shareholders exceed required distribution amounts as defined
under the Internal Revenue Code. Shareholders may also pay additional taxes on
these excess distributions.

                                      21

<PAGE>



   Under current tax law, foreign currency and capital losses realized after
October 31 may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the
following fiscal year. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009, the Fund
deferred $1,421 and recognized $108 of post-October losses.

   The components of distributable earnings on a tax basis (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) which is disclosed in the table above)
consist of undistributed ordinary income of $0 and undistributed long-term
capital gains of $0.

   The differences between the book and tax basis components of distributable
earnings relate principally to the timing of recognition of income and gains
for federal income tax purposes. Short-term gain distributions reported in the
Statement of Changes in Net Assets, if any, are reported as ordinary income for
federal tax purposes. Distributions are determined on a tax basis and may
differ from net investment income and realized capital gains for financial
reporting purposes.

NOTE 10 -- RECLASSIFICATION OF CAPITAL ACCOUNTS

   As of December 31, 2009, the Fund increased undistributed net investment
income by $39,064, increased the accumulated net realized loss by $740, and
decreased capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest by $38,324.

NOTE 11 -- RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

   In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2010-06 "Improving Disclosures about
Fair Value Measurements". ASU 2010-06 amends FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to require
additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Certain disclosures
required by ASU No. 2010-06 are effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2009, and other required disclosures are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the
impact ASU No. 2010-06 will have on its financial statement disclosures.

NOTE 12 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT EVALUATIONS

   Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund
through February 16, 2010, the date the financial statements were issued, and
has determined that the following subsequent event requires recognition or
disclosure in these financial statements.

   Virtus Distributors, Inc., the Fund's administrator, sub-contracts with PNC
Global Investment Servicing for certain sub-administrative duties.

   On February 2, 2010, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. ("PNC") entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") with The Bank
of New York Mellon Corporation ("BNY Mellon"). Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, which has been

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc.
(the "Fund") at December 31, 2009, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at December 31, 2009 by correspondence with the
custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                        SUPPLEMENTARY PROXY INFORMATION

   The Special Meeting of Shareholders of The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. was
held on October 27, 2009. The meeting concluded with the Fund remaining
closed-end. The number of in-person and proxy votes represented at the special
meeting did not constitute a quorum and the chairman of the special meeting
closed the meeting without adjournment as permitted by the Fund's bylaws. The
number of proxies received represented approximately 32% of the Fund's
outstanding shares, with less than 8% of outstanding shares in favor of the
conversion proposal. The affirmative vote of a majority of shares outstanding
as of the record date would have been required to pass the proposal.

   The Fund was required to submit the conversion proposal to its shareholders
in accordance with its Articles of Incorporation because its shares traded on
the New York Stock Exchange during the quarter ended June 30, 2009 at an
average discount from their net asset value of 10% or more, determined on the
basis of the discount as of the end of the last trading day in each week during
such quarter. As set forth in the Fund's definitive proxy statement filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 28, 2009, the Board of
Directors, including its independent directors, voted unanimously to recommend
against conversion to an open-end fund.

                 AUTOMATIC REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") allows you to conveniently
reinvest distributions monthly in additional Fund shares thereby enabling you
to compound your returns from the Fund. By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able
to invest money regularly and automatically, and watch your investment grow.

   It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure
a profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

ENROLLMENT IN THE REINVESTMENT PLAN

   It is the policy of the Fund to automatically reinvest distributions payable
to shareholders. A "registered" shareholder automatically becomes a participant
in the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"). The
Plan authorizes the Fund to credit all shares of common stock to participants
upon a distribution regardless of whether the shares are trading at a discount
or premium to the net asset value. Registered shareholders may terminate their
participation and receive distributions in cash by contacting Computershare
Trust Company, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator"). The termination will become
effective with the next distribution if the Plan Administrator is notified at
least 7 business days prior to the distribution payment date. Registered
shareholders that wish to change their distribution option from cash payment to
reinvest may do so by contacting the Plan Administrator at 1-800-272-2700.

   In the case of banks, brokers, or other nominees which hold your shares for
you as the beneficial owner, the Plan Administrator will administer the Plan
based on the information provided by the bank, broker or nominee. To the extent
that you wish to participate in the Plan, you should contact the broker, bank
or nominee holding your shares to ensure that your account is properly
represented. If necessary, you may have your shares taken out of the name of
the broker, bank or nominee and register them in your own name.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED THROUGH THE REINVESTMENT PLAN

   When a distribution is declared, nonparticipants in the plan will receive
cash. Participants in the Plan will receive shares of the Fund valued as
described below:

   If on the record date of the distribution, the market price of the Fund's
common stock is less than the net asset value, the Plan Administrator will buy
Fund shares on behalf of the Participant in the open market, on the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) or elsewhere. The price per share will be equal to the
weighted average price of all shares purchased, including commissions.
Commission rates are currently $0.02 per share, although the rate is subject to
change and may vary. If, following the commencement of purchases and before the
Plan Administrator has completed its purchases, the trading price equals or
exceeds the most recent net asset value of the common shares, the Plan
Administrator may cease purchasing shares on the open market and the Fund may
issue the remaining shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) the net asset
value on the last day the Plan Administrator purchased shares or (b) 95% of the
market price on such day. In the case where the Plan Administrator has
terminated open market purchase and the Fund has issued the remaining shares,
the number of shares received by the Participant in respect of the cash
distribution will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares

                                      30

<PAGE>


purchased in the open market and the price at which the Fund issued the
remaining shares. Under certain circumstances, the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission may require limitation or temporary
suspension of market purchases of shares under the Plan. The Plan Administrator
will not be accountable for its inability to make a purchase during such a
period.

   If on the record date of the distribution, the market price is equal to or
exceeds the net asset value, Participants will be issued new shares by the Fund
at the greater of the (a) the net asset value on the record date or (b) 95% of
the market price on such date.

   The automatic reinvestment of distributions will not relieve Participants of
any income tax which may be payable on such distributions. A Participant in the
Plan will be treated for federal income tax purposes, as having received on a
payment date, a distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant
could have received instead of shares. If you participate in the Plan, you will
receive a Form 1099-DIV concerning the Federal tax status of distributions paid
during the year.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

   Participants in the Plan have the option of making additional cash payments
for investment in shares of the Fund. Such payments can be made in any amount
from $100 per payment to $3,000 per month. The Plan Administrator will use the
funds received to purchase Fund shares in the open market on the 15/th/ of each
month or the next business day if the 15/th/ falls on a weekend or holiday (the
"Investment Date"). The purchase price per share will be equal to the weighted
average price of all shares purchased on the Investment Date, including
commissions. There is no charge to shareholders for Cash Purchases. The plan
administrator's fee will be paid by the Fund. However, each participating
shareholder will pay pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred
(currently $0.02 per share, but may vary and is subject to change) with respect
to the Plan Administrator's open market purchases in connection with all cash
investments. Voluntary cash payments should be sent to Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., PO Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078.

   Participants have an unconditional right to obtain the return of any cash
payment if the Plan Administrator receives written notice at least 5 business
days before such payment is to be invested.

AUTOMATIC MONTHLY INVESTMENT

   Participants in the Plan may purchase additional shares by means of an
Automatic Monthly Investment of not less than $100 nor more than $3,000 per
month by electronic funds transfer from a predesignated U.S bank account. If a
Participant has already established a Plan account and wishes to initiate
Automatic Monthly Investments, the Participant must complete and sign an
automatic monthly investment form and return it to the Plan Administrator
together with a voided check or deposit slip for the account from which funds
are to be withdrawn. Automatic monthly investment forms may be obtained from
the Plan Administrator by calling 1-800-272-2700.

TERMINATION OF SHARES

   Shareholders wishing to liquidate shares held with the Plan Administrator
must do so in writing or by calling 1-800-272-2700. The Plan Administrator does
not charge a fee for liquidating your shares; however, a brokerage commission
of $0.02 will be charged. This charge may vary and is subject to change.

                                      31

<PAGE>



   Once terminated, you may re-enroll in the Plan (provided you still have
shares registered in your name) by contacting the Plan Administrator at
1-800-272-2700.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   For more information regarding the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase
Plan, please contact the Plan Administrator at 1-800-272-2700 or visit our
website at Virtus.com.

   The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or distribution paid subsequent
to written notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan at least 90
days before the record date for such distribution. The Plan also may be amended
or terminated by the Plan Administrator with at least 90 days written notice to
participants in the Plan.

             whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted
             with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity
             controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the

             sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
             subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and

             registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph
             (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with

<PAGE>


III  Factors to consider when voting.

     A.   A Delegate may abstain from voting when it concludes that the effect

          long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its

          accountability.

     D.   In analyzing CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS, the Delegate shall vote on

          economic benefits associated with amending an issuer's state of
          incorporation, dilution or improved accountability associated with
          changes in capital structure, management proposals to require a
          supermajority shareholder vote to amend charters and bylaws and
          bundled or "conditioned" proxy proposals.

     E.   In analyzing EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROPOSALS and MANAGEMENT MATTERS,
          the Adviser shall vote on a case-by-case basis taking into

          perquisites, particularly in conjunction with sub-par performance and
          employee layoffs.

     F.   In analyzing PROXY CONTESTS FOR CONTROL, the Delegate shall vote on a
          case-by-case basis taking into consideration such factors as long-term
          financial performance of the target company relative to its industry;
          management's track record; background to the proxy contest;

     B.   The Adviser delegated with authority to vote proxies for Portfolio
          Holdings shall be deemed to assume a duty of care to safeguard the
          best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. No Delegate shall
          accept direction or inappropriate influence from any other client,
          director or employee of any affiliated company and shall not cast any
          vote inconsistent with this Statement of Policy without obtaining the
          prior approval of the Fund or its duly authorized representative(s).

     C.   With regard to each Series for which there is a duly appointed
          Subadviser acting pursuant to an investment advisory agreement
          satisfying the requirements of Section 15(a) of the Investment Company
          Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules thereunder, the Subadviser may,
          pursuant to delegated authority from the Adviser, vote proxies for
          Portfolio Holdings with regard to the Series or portion of the assets
          thereof for which the Subadviser is responsible. In such case, the
          Subadviser shall vote proxies for the Portfolio Holdings in accordance
          with Sections II, III and V of this Statement of Policy, provided,
          however, that the Subadviser may vote proxies in accordance with its
          own proxy voting policy/procedures ("Subadviser Procedures") if the
          following two conditions are satisfied: (1) the Adviser must have
          approved the Subadviser Procedures based upon the Adviser's
          determination that the Subadviser Procedures are reasonably designed
          to further the best economic interests of the affected Fund
          shareholders, and (2) the Subadviser Procedures are reviewed and
          approved annually by the Board of Trustees. The Subadviser will
          promptly notify the Adviser of any material changes to the Subadviser
          Procedures. The Adviser will periodically review the votes by the
          Subadviser for consistency with this Statement of Policy.

V.   Conflicts of Interest

     A.   The Fund and its Delegate(s) seek to avoid actual or perceived
          conflicts of interest in the voting of proxies for Portfolio Holdings
          between the interests of Fund shareholders, on one hand, and those of
          the Adviser, Delegate, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          of the Fund, on the other hand. The Board of Trustees may take into
          account a wide array of factors in determining whether such a conflict
          exists, whether such conflict is material in nature, and how to
          properly address or resolve the same.

     B.   While each conflict situation varies based on the particular facts
          presented and the requirements of governing law, the Board of Trustees
          or its delegate(s) may take the following actions, among others, or
          otherwise give weight to the following factors, in addressing material
          conflicts of interest in voting (or directing Delegates to vote)
          proxies pertaining to Portfolio Holdings: (i) rely on the
          recommendations of an established, independent third party with
          qualifications to vote proxies such as Institutional Shareholder
          Services; (ii) vote pursuant to the recommendation of the proposing
          Delegate; (iii) abstaining; or (iv) where two or more Delegates
          provide conflicting requests, vote shares in proportion to the assets
          under management of the each proposing Delegate.

     C.   The Adviser shall promptly notify the President of the Fund once any
          actual or potential conflict of interest exists and their
          recommendations for protecting the best interests of Fund's
          shareholders. No Adviser shall waive any conflict of interest or vote
          any conflicted proxies without the prior written approval of the Board
          of Trustees or the President of the Fund pursuant to section D of this
          Article.

<PAGE>


     D.   In the event that a determination, authorization or waiver under this
          Statement of Policy is requested at a time other than a regularly
          scheduled meeting of the Board of Trustees, the President of the Fund
          shall be empowered with the power and responsibility to interpret and
          apply this Statement of Policy and provide a report of his or her
          determinations at the next following meeting of the Board of Trustees.

VI.  Miscellaneous.

     A.   A copy of the current Statement of Policy with Respect to Proxy Voting
          and the voting records for the Fund reconciling proxies with Portfolio
          Holdings and recording proxy voting guideline compliance and
          justification, shall be kept in an easily accessible place and
          available upon request.

     B.   The Adviser shall present a report of any material deviations from
          this Statement of Policy at every regularly scheduled meeting of the
          Board of Trustees and shall provide such other reports as the Board of
          Trustees may request from time to time. The Adviser shall provide to
          the Fund or any shareholder a record of its effectuation of proxy
          voting pursuant to this Statement of Policy at such times and in such
          format or medium as the Fund shall reasonably request. The Adviser
          shall be solely responsible for complying with the disclosure and
          reporting requirements under applicable laws and regulations,
          including, without limitation, Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
          Advisers Act of 1940. The Adviser shall gather, collate and present
          information relating to the its proxy voting activities of those of
          each Delegate in such format and medium as the Fund shall determine
          from time to time in order for the Fund to discharge its disclosure
          and reporting obligations pursuant to Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment
          Company Act of 1940, as amended.

     C.   The Adviser shall pay all costs associated with proxy voting for
          Portfolio Holdings pursuant to this Statement of Policy and assisting
          the Fund in providing public notice of the manner in which such
          proxies were voted.

     D.   The Adviser may delegate its responsibilities hereunder to a proxy
          committee established from time to time by the Adviser, as the case
          may be. In performing its duties hereunder, the Adviser, or any duly
          authorized committee, may engage the services of a research and/or
          voting adviser or agent, the cost of which shall be borne by such
          entity.

     This Statement of Policy shall be presented to the Board of Trustees
     annually for their amendment and/or approval.

       POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

       There may be certain inherent conflicts of interest that arise in
       connection with the Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's management of each
       Fund's investments and the investments of any other accounts he manages.
       Such conflicts could arise from the aggregation of orders for all
       accounts managed by a particular portfolio manager, the allocation of
       purchases across all such accounts, the allocation of IPOs and any soft
       dollar arrangements that the Adviser may have in place that could benefit
       the Funds and/or such other accounts. The Board of Trustees/Directors has
       adopted on behalf of the Funds policies and procedures designed to
       address any such conflicts of interest to ensure that all transactions
       are executed in the best interest of the Funds' shareholders. The
       Advisers and Sub adviser are required to certify their compliance with
       these procedures to the Board of Trustees on a quarterly basis. There
       have been no material compliance issues with respect to any of these
       policies and procedures during the Funds' most recent fiscal year ended
       December 31, 2009. Additionally, there are no material conflicts of
       interest between the investment strategy of a Fund and the investment
       strategy of other accounts managed by Mr. Neel and Mr. Dickerson since
       portfolio managers generally manage funds and other accounts having
       similar investment strategies.

(A)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS

       For the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2009,
       following is a description of Mr. Neel's and Mr. Dickerson's compensation
       structure as portfolio managers of ZA and Euclid.

       Virtus Investment Partners, Inc. and its affiliated investment management
       firms (collectively, "Virtus"), believe that the firm's compensation
       program is adequate and competitive to attract and retain high-caliber
       investment professionals. Investment professionals at Virtus receive a
       competitive base salary, an incentive bonus opportunity and a benefits
       package. Portfolio managers may also have the opportunity to participate
       in long-term equity programs, including potential awards of Virtus
       restricted stock units ("RSUs") with multi-year vesting, subject to
       Virtus board approval.

       Following is a more detailed description of the compensation structure of
       the Fund's portfolio managers.

       Base Salary. Each Portfolio Manager is paid a fixed base salary, which is
       designed to be competitive in light of the individual's experience and
       responsibilities. Base salary is determined using compensation survey
       results of investment industry compensation conducted by an independent
       third party in evaluating competitive market compensation for its
       investment management professionals.

       Incentive Bonus. Annual incentive payments are based on targeted
       compensation levels, adjusted based on profitability, investment
       performance factors and a subjective assessment of contribution to the
       team effort. The short-term incentive payment is generally paid in cash,
       but a portion may be made in Virtus RSUs. Individual payments are
       assessed using comparisons of actual investment performance compared with
       specific peer groups or index measures.

<PAGE>


       Performance of the funds managed is generally measured over one-, three-
       and five year periods and an individual manager's participation is based
       on the performance of each fund/account managed.

       While portfolio manager compensation contains a performance component,
       this component is further adjusted to reward investment personnel for
       managing within the stated framework and for not taking unnecessary
       risks. This approach ensures that investment management personnel remain
       focused on managing and acquiring securities that correspond to a fund's
       mandate and risk profile and are discouraged from taking on more risk and
       unnecessary exposure to chase performance for personal gain. We believe
       we have appropriate controls in place to handle any potential conflicts
       that may result from a substantial portion of portfolio manager
       compensation being tied to performance

       Other Benefits. Portfolio managers are also eligible to participate in
       broad-based plans offered generally to employees of Virtus and its
       affiliates, including 401(k), health and other employee benefit plans.

       In summary, the Investment Manager believes that overall compensation is
       both fair and competitive while rewarding employees for not taking
       unnecessary risks to chase personal performance.

(A)(4) DISCLOSURE OF SECURITIES OWNERSHIP

       For the most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2009,
       beneficial ownership of shares of the Fund by Messrs. Dickerson and Neel
       are as follows. Beneficial ownership was determined in accordance with
       rule 16a-1(a)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR
       240.161-1(a)(2)).

     (b)     There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
             financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
             (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the registrant's second
             fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
             materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,

                        SENIOR MANAGEMENT CODE OF ETHICS

I    Background

     Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that each registered
investment company disclose whether or not it has adopted a code of ethics that
applies to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer,
principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar
functions, regardless of whether these individuals are employed by the fund or a
third party (collectively, "Senior Management"). If a fund has not adopted such
a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so in certain regulatory
filings.

     Pursuant to various management agreements between The Zweig Fund, Inc. and
The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Funds") and Phoenix subsidiaries,
Phoenix employees currently serve as Senior Management to the Funds. As
employees of Phoenix they are subject to the Phoenix Code of Ethics (the "PCE").
The PCE complies with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other relevant
requirements. The Boards of Directors of the Funds, on October 1, 2003, adopted
the Phoenix Code of Ethics for the Senior Management of the Funds.

II   Board Resolution adopted on October 1, 2003

     WHEREAS, that Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that
each registered investment company publicly disclose whether or not it has
adopted a code of ethics that applies to its principal executive officer,
principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or
persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these individuals
are employed by the fund or a third party (collectively, "Senior Management");
and

     WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has reviewed the Phoenix Code of Conduct,
as presented at this meeting, as the same may be amended from time to time (the
"Senior Management Code") and has determined the same to provide written
standards that are reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote the
types of conduct by Senior Management that are contemplated by regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; now, therefore, be it

     RESOLVED, that the Fund does hereby approve and adopt the Senior Management
Code as the written code of ethics that applies to its principal executive
officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
individuals are employed by the Fund or a third party;

     FURTHER RESOLVED, the Chairman of the Fund, with the advice of counsel and
subject to the terms and conditions specified in the Phoenix Code of Conduct,
shall be appointed and directed to oversee the consideration and granting of any
waivers of the Senior Management Code with respect to Senior Management other
than the Chairman provided however that the Chairman shall provide notice of any
such waiver to the Board of Directors at the next succeeding regularly scheduled
meeting of the Board of Directors and provided further that any requested
waivers involving the Chairman shall be presented to the Board for approval; and

     FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Chief Compliance Officer of The Phoenix

deliver and execute any and all instruments, certificates and documents as she
or he may deem necessary or appropriate, with the advice of counsel, to fully
carry out the purposes and intent of the Senior Management Code.

Commitment to Shareholders

Phoenix is committed to providing shareholder value. One way we do this is by
observing the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct in all of our
business dealings.

Conflicts of Interest

Phoenix expects each of its employees and directors to maintain the highest
moral and ethical standards and to avoid conflicts of interest in conducting
business activities. A "conflict of interest" occurs when an individual's
private interest interferes, or even appears to interfere, in any way with the
interests of the Company as a whole. A conflict situation can arise when an
employee or director takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult
to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively.
Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee or director, or a member of
his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her
position in the Company.

An employee requested by Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another
company owes a fiduciary duty to Phoenix as well as to the company on whose
board of directors he or she serves. Where conflicts of interest arise between
the interests of Phoenix and the other company, the employee should consult
Phoenix's General Counsel for guidance. Moreover, no employee requested by
Phoenix to serve on the board of directors of another company may accept fees or
other compensation for board service. In the event the company for which an
employee serves as a director requires directors to receive fees, any
remuneration received by the employee must be donated to a charitable
organization. The Company will offset any tax consequences incurred by the
employee.

All conflicts of interest must be disclosed in writing to the Chief Compliance
Officer. Employees and directors are required to file a Conflict of Interest
Statement annually. Any conflicts of interest that arise following completion of
the Conflict of Interest Statement must be promptly reported to the Chief
Compliance Officer in writing.

Corporate Opportunities

Employees and directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate
interests when the opportunity to do so arises. Consequently, employees and
directors are prohibited from engaging in the following activities:

..    taking for themselves personal opportunities that are discovered through
     the use of corporate property, information or position;

..    using Company property, information or position for personal gain; and

..    competing with the Company.

Insider Trading and Personal Trading

Federal securities laws and Company policy prohibit the purchase or sale of
securities while in possession of material non-public information and prohibit
passing such information on to others. No employee or director may buy or sell
Phoenix securities if he or she has material non-public information. This
restriction also applies to an employee's or director's spouse, other adults
living in the employee's or director's household, minor children and persons for
whom the employee exercises investment authority. Employees, directors and their
family members also must avoid passing non-public information on to third
parties.

<PAGE>


Information is "material" if a reasonable investor would probably consider the
information important in deciding whether to buy, hold or sell securities of the
company to which the information relates.

Directors, officers and their family members1 are also subject to certain
restrictions under New York Insurance Law governing acquisition of Phoenix
shares. Until June 25, 2006, directors and officers, whether acting directly or
indirectly, may only acquire, or offer to acquire, such shares: (i) through a
Phoenix plan; or (ii) through a registered broker or dealer at quoted prices on
the date of purchase. Family members may only acquire such shares through the
latter method.

All directors, all employees with a title of Vice President or higher, plus
certain other employees whose positions place them in regular contact with
non-public information, and certain family members of all of them are subject to
a further restriction as well: these individuals may only buy or sell Phoenix
securities during "window" periods. You have been or will be notified: (i) if
these restrictions apply to you; and (ii) when periods begin and end.

In addition, officers with a title of Executive Vice President or higher,
certain other individuals who have been notified by the Corporate Secretary, and
certain family members of each of them, must pre-clear all transactions in
Phoenix securities through our Corporate Secretary. Further, they must promptly
report such transactions to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

No employee or director may buy or sell securities of another company with the
knowledge that those securities are being considered for purchase or sale by
Phoenix, any of its subsidiaries or any of the Company's advisory accounts. In
the case of any company in which Phoenix owns 10 percent or more of the
outstanding equity, no employee (nor certain family members) may make any
personal investment without prior approval from the Law Department.

Certain employees who are involved with the Company's investment adviser and
broker-dealer operations may be required to secure pre-clearance of and/or
report all personal securities transactions by these individuals. In addition,
the Company reserves the right to require duplicate confirmations, quarterly
transaction reports and prior clearance for any personal securities transactions
by those individuals. If you have any question as to whether your position
requires pre-clearance or reporting, you should contact the compliance officer
for your business area (investment adviser or broker-dealer) or the Corporate
Compliance Department.

Footnote 1 An officer's or director's child, stepchild, grandchild, parent,
step-parent, grandparent, spouse, or sibling, including in-laws and adoptive
relationships.

Market Timing

Company policy prohibits employees from engaging in excessive trading or market
timing activities with respect to any mutual fund, regardless of whether such
mutual fund is affiliated with the Company. This prohibition does not apply to
money market funds or other funds designed to permit short term investment or to
non-volitional investment vehicles such as 401(k) plans, automatic reinvestment
programs, or asset allocation programs.

Confidentiality

Directors and employees are required to maintain the confidentiality of
information entrusted to them in the course of their work for the Company.
Disclosure of confidential information is restricted to authorized persons or
situations in which disclosure is legally mandated. Confidential information
includes all non-public information about the Company or persons with which it
conducts business (such as customers, vendors and potential investment targets)
including, but not limited to: internal operating procedures; investment
strategies; sales data and customer lists; financial plans; projections; and
clients' personal information. (See also Privacy and Confidential Personal
Information below). A director's or employee's obligation to protect
confidential information continues even after termination of his or her position
with the Company.

<PAGE>


Protection and Use of Company Property and Assets

Employees have access to Company property to assist them in effectively carrying
out their duties to the Company. Company property should only be used for
legitimate purposes. All employees should protect the Company's property and
ensure its efficient use. Theft, fraud, carelessness and waste have a direct
impact on the Company's profitability.

Examples of Company property include proprietary and non-public information,
equipment, facilities, vehicles, funds and other assets. Improper use or abuse
of Company property is prohibited. Expenses to be paid for by the Company, via
reimbursement or direct payment, are limited to those expenses that are
authorized and related to legitimate business activities.

Contract Review

The following contracts must be reviewed by the Law Department prior to being
signed, amended or terminated early:

..    Contracts that involve an expenditure or value of greater than $25,000;

..    Contracts that pose significant legal obligations on Phoenix (such as an
     obligation not to solicit business, not to hire, or to provide
     indemnification); and

..    Contracts that involve employment or consulting services.

In addition, contracts that could have a significant impact on Phoenix's
financial results or reports must be reviewed by Corporate Finance for business
risks and financial implications.

Corporate Disclosures

As a public company, Phoenix is required to publicly disclose certain
information on a regular basis. This includes financial information and other
material information about the Company. It is imperative that such information
be disseminated in a consistent manner and in accordance with SEC disclosure
requirements and Company policy. In order to ensure that information released is
accurate and properly disseminated, only certain individuals are authorized to
speak on behalf of the Company. Employees are prohibited from speaking with
rating agencies, analysts, investors or the press without obtaining prior
authorization from the President and Chief Executive Officer. Employees
receiving any such inquiries should refer such individuals to the appropriate
area for response:

..    Members of the Press - to the senior officer, Corporate Communications;

..    Rating Agencies - to any officer in the Rating Agency Relations unit; and

..    Securities Analysts and Investors - to any officer in the Investor
     Relations unit.

In order to enable the Company to comply with applicable law, Company policy
prohibits directors and employees from publicly disclosing any non-public
information about the Company's financial performance, other than at times and
through methods approved by the Company's President or Chief Financial Officer.
Employees are also prohibited from commenting on the Company's stock
performance.

Accuracy and Retention of Company Records

The integrity of Phoenix's records is vital to the Company's continued success.
The falsification, misuse or inappropriate alteration of Company documents is
strictly prohibited. Phoenix's business transactions must be accurately recorded
on the Company's books and records in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, any other required accounting basis and established
Company policy. Financial information must fairly represent all relevant
information.

The retention and destruction of Company records must follow established Company
policies and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

<PAGE>


Commitment to Customers

Phoenix upholds its commitment to our customers by conducting our business
fairly and honestly and maintaining the highest ethical standards in all
dealings with customers.

Safeguarding Customer Assets

Employees have an obligation to safeguard the assets of our customers at all
times, and to protect them from all forms of misuse. Misappropriation of funds
can include theft, fraud, embezzlement or unauthorized borrowing. Employees must
not, under any circumstances, misappropriate funds, property or other assets, or
assist another individual in doing so.

Ethical Market Conduct

The Company expects all who are involved in the sales and marketing of its
products and services to abide by the following principles:

..    conduct business according to high standards of honesty and fairness;

..    provide competent and customer-focused sales and service;

..    engage in active and fair competition;

..    provide clear, honest and fair advertising and sales materials;

..    handle customer complaints and disputes in an appropriate and timely
     manner; and

..    monitor sales and service procedures to help ensure compliance with ethical
     market conduct.

Privacy and Confidential Personal Information

It is the responsibility of every employee to maintain the privacy of
confidential personal information. Confidential personal information includes
non-public financial and health information obtained from consumers and
customers in connection with providing a financial product or service. Specific
examples of confidential personal information include information concerning
assets, income, businesses, estates, financial plans or health.

The misuse of confidential personal information could subject the Company and
its employees to civil liability or criminal penalties. Before releasing
confidential information to anyone, employees must make certain that releasing
it is permitted under the Company's policies or authorized in writing by the
person to whom it relates.

Customer Complaints

The Company is committed to fairly and expeditiously handling all customer
complaints. All complaints must be handled and reported in accordance with
established corporate policies as well as procedures established for the
applicable business unit or affiliate. To facilitate resolution of each customer
complaint, as well as to facilitate any related regulatory inquiries, all
customer complaints and related communications are centrally retained.

Fraud

The Company strongly supports all efforts to detect and prevent fraud. It
believes that only through aggressive action to combat fraud can the Company
continue to meet its fundamental obligations to its stockholders and customers.
When there is reason to believe that the Company has been the target of fraud or
attempted fraud, it will aggressively work with the appropriate law enforcement
officials to seek prosecution and conviction of the responsible individual(s).
Any employee who is aware or suspects that the Company has been the target of
fraud or attempted fraud should report it to the Corporate Audit Department
immediately.

<PAGE>


Insurance Anti-Fraud Plan

In accordance with insurance regulatory requirements, the Company has a
comprehensive insurance anti-fraud plan that is designed to:

..    prevent insurance fraud, including internal fraud involving the Company's
     officers, employees or agents, fraud resulting from misrepresentations on
     applications for insurance, and claims fraud;

..    report insurance fraud to appropriate law enforcement and regulatory
     authorities;

..    encourage cooperation in the prosecution of insurance fraud cases; and

..    aggressively pursue recovery of all sums improperly paid by the Company as
     a result of fraud.

Commitment to Corporate Citizenship

Phoenix is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, which includes
complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we
operate as well as engaging in fair competition in the marketplace.

Complying with Legal and Regulatory Requirements

The Company expects all employees to conduct business in accordance with all
applicable laws and regulations. The laws and regulations related to the
financial services industry are complex, thus placing a duty on each employee to
take all reasonable steps to ensure his or her actions are in compliance.
Compliance with the law does not, however, comprise our entire ethical
responsibility. Rather, it is a minimum standard for performance of our duties.
(See also the provisions below on Commitment to Ethics and Compliance).

Accounting, Internal Accounting Controls and Auditing Matters

The Company treats complaints about accounting, internal accounting controls, or
auditing matters seriously and expeditiously. Employees have the opportunity to
submit confidential and anonymous complaints about accounting or auditing
matters for review by representatives of Phoenix, and if appropriate, the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors. These complaints will be handled in a
manner that protects the confidentiality and anonymity of the employee when so
requested by the employee. (See the Toll-Free Help Line section of this Code, on
page 11).

No employee will be terminated or otherwise retaliated against for submitting a
complaint under this procedure if he or she reasonably believes that the
complaint may involve a violation of federal securities or anti-fraud laws.

Fair Dealing

Each employee must deal fairly with the Company's customers, suppliers,
competitors and employees. No employee should take unfair advantage of anyone
through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information,
misrepresentation of material facts, or other unfair-dealing practice.

Antitrust

The Company is committed to preserving a free and competitive marketplace and
will not engage in any understandings or agreements with any competitor that
could result in a restraint of trade. Employees must avoid engaging in any
conduct that violates the antitrust laws, such as agreements with competitors
regarding prices, terms of sale, division of markets and allocations of
customers. Discussions with competitors related to market share, projected sales
for any specific product or service, revenues and expenses, production
schedules, unannounced products and services, pricing or marketing strategies
are prohibited.

The antitrust laws and, thus, the above prohibitions, also apply to informal
contacts with competitors, such as encounters at trade shows or meetings of
professional organizations. Every employee has an obligation to avoid situations
that could result in a violation of the antitrust laws.

Anti-Money Laundering

<PAGE>


It is the responsibility of every employee to protect the Company from
exploitation by individuals engaged in money laundering activities. Accordingly,
affected employees must:

..    become familiar with the anti-money laundering laws and their requirements
     as applied to the Company; and

..    learn and fully comply with the Company's anti-money laundering policies
     and procedures.

Failure to comply with applicable laws or the Company's policies may result in
significant criminal and civil penalties for the Company as well as for those
individuals involved. Furthermore, even association with money laundering
activity could subject both the Company and its employees to civil and criminal
penalties.

Lobbying and Political Contributions

Lobbying is generally defined as communicating with a public official, or a
member of his or her staff, in the legislative or executive branch of
government, for the purpose of influencing legislative or administrative action.
Lobbying is highly regulated and lobbyists are required to be registered and to
report their activities. No employee may engage in lobbying on behalf of Phoenix
without prior permission of the Law Department. The giving of gifts to local
public officials and members of their staff, whether in the form of meals,
tickets to events or otherwise, is strictly regulated by most states and by the
federal government. Special restrictions also apply to employees who provide
investment management services to public entities.

Employees must be careful to distinguish between personal and corporate
political activities. Unless specifically requested by the Company to
communicate on its behalf on a particular issue, you should identify
communications with legislators as expressing your own personal beliefs and not
those of Phoenix. The use of Phoenix stationery for any personal political
communication is prohibited. Any employee wishing to be a candidate for elective
office should consult with his or her supervisor and department head in advance.

Questions regarding the Company's position on proposed legislation or
regulations should be directed to Government Relations or the Law Department.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits the payment or authorization of the
payment of any money, or the giving of value, directly or indirectly, to a
foreign official for the purpose of:

..    influencing any act or decision of the foreign official; or

..    inducing the foreign official to use his influence to assist in obtaining
     business for or directing business to any person.

A "foreign official" is any person acting in an official capacity on behalf of a
foreign government, agency, department or instrumentality. Also included under
the term "foreign official" are foreign political parties, officials of
political parties and candidates for foreign political office.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to all directors, employees and agents
of the Company. Violation of the act can result in both fines and imprisonment.

Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents

Employees must avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others.
Intellectual property includes copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents
and trade secrets. Improper use includes copying, distributing or modifying
third party copyrighted materials without permission. Infringement may result in
criminal as well as civil liabilities for Phoenix and its employees.

The Company has an agreement with the Copyright Clearance Center that gives a
license to Phoenix employees to make photocopies of many publications for
business purposes. Questions about the types of copying that are covered by the
agreement should be directed to the Corporate Compliance Department.

<PAGE>


Commitment to Employees

Phoenix's employees are our most important asset and we are committed to
fostering a work environment in which employees have the opportunity to grow,
contribute and participate free from discrimination.

Equal Opportunity

The Company employs and promotes on the basis of merit and achievement without
regard to age, race, gender, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, sexual
orientation, marital status, or disability. This policy applies to every phase
of the employment process and every aspect of the employment relationship:
recruitment, hiring, training, promotions, transfers, terminations, benefits,
compensation and participation in Company-sponsored educational, social and
recreational programs.

Sexual Harassment

The Company prohibits sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment
includes: unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and other
verbal, visual or physical conduct when:

..    submission is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of a
     person's employment;

..    submission to or rejection of inappropriate conduct by an employee is used
     as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee; or

..    the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an
     individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or
     offensive working environment.

Sexual harassment also includes: unwelcome sexual flirtations and advances;
verbal abuse of a sexual nature; inappropriate touching; graphic or verbal
comments about an individual's body; displaying in the workplace a sexually
suggestive object or picture; and sexually explicit or offensive jokes.

Employment of Relatives

Except in the limited circumstances described in this section, the Company does
not permit the employment of a director's or employee's "relative", which term
includes a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, sibling, step-parent,
step-child, step-sibling, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece,
or first cousin including in-laws. Specifically, the Company prohibits the
hiring of a "relative" of any director or officer, or of any employee working in
the Corporate Audit, Corporate Compliance, Human Resources or Law Departments.
Although this policy does not require the termination of any employee who
becomes related to a person described in the preceding sentence through a
post-hiring event such as marriage or a promotion, any employee who becomes
"related" through such an occurrence should promptly advise his or her
supervisor. The Company will then take steps to assure that no employee reports
to or supervises a relative and that related employees do not work in the same
department or report to the same supervisor. The employment of a "relative" of
any officer at the level of Executive Vice President or higher will not be
permitted or accommodated even if the relationship results from a post-hiring
event.

Workplace Safety

The Company is committed to maintaining a work environment that is safe and
healthy for its employees and others. All job-related injuries or illnesses
should be reported immediately to your supervisor or Human Resources
representative. Questions concerning health and safety matters should also be
referred to one of them.

The Company does not tolerate acts of violence or threats of violence against
employees or Company property. Possession of firearms or other weapons anywhere
on Company property or while conducting Company business is prohibited. Any
situation or concern involving violent

<PAGE>


behavior or the threat of violence should be immediately reported to Security or
Human Resources.

Drugs and Alcohol

The sale, purchase, use, possession or transfer of narcotics or other legally
controlled substances by employees while on Company premises or on Company
business (other than use of prescription drugs in accordance with a physician's
orders) is prohibited. Employees attending functions on behalf of the Company
where alcohol is served are expected to use good judgment and avoid consuming
excessive amounts of alcoholic beverages.

Felony Convictions

Federal law prohibits the employment by an insurance company, without the
consent of the appropriate state insurance department, of any person convicted
of a felony involving dishonesty or breach of trust. To assist the Company in
fulfilling its responsibilities under this law, employees are required to
disclose any felony conviction to the Company at the time of application for
employment. Any employee who is subsequently convicted of a felony must report
this fact to the Company immediately.

Employee Ownership of Phoenix Stock

Employees and directors are subject to various requirements governing their
ownership of Company stock, including federal securities law and New York
insurance law. Please refer to the Insider Trading and Personal Trading section
of this Code (at page 1) for more information.

Commitment to Ethics and Compliance

A strong commitment to business ethics and compliance is the foundation of a
successful organization. Every employee is expected to carry out the Company's
business activities in an ethical manner and in a fashion consistent with
applicable laws, regulations, policies and guidelines.

Ethical Decision Making

Phoenix's success is dependent on each of us applying the highest ethical
standards to whatever we do on behalf of the Company. Employees should consider
the following questions before making decisions.

..    Is my action consistent with approved Company practices?

..    Is my action consistent with the Company's values?

..    Does my action give the appearance of impropriety?

..    Can I, in good conscience, defend my action to my supervisor, other
     employees and the general public?

..    Does my action meet my personal code of ethical behavior?

..    Does my action conform to the spirit of these and all other applicable
     guidelines?

Monitoring Code Compliance

The Corporate Compliance and the Corporate Audit Departments are responsible for
monitoring the compliance activities of all areas of the Company and for
ensuring that this Code of Conduct is being followed. Compliance will be
monitored by periodic audits where appropriate. Additionally, the Company's
Chief Compliance Officer must report annually to the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors on the level of compliance with our requirement that each
employee and director complete the Code of Conduct Acknowledgement and the
Conflict of Interest Declaration. Waivers of violations of the Code by directors
or by officers with a title of Senior Vice President or higher may only be
granted by the Audit Committee or the Board. Such waivers must be promptly
reported to shareholders. All other waivers, which may be granted by

<PAGE>


the Chief Compliance Officer, the President or any Executive Vice President,
shall be reported to the Audit Committee but need not be reported to the
shareholders.

Toll-Free Help Line

Phoenix maintains a confidential, 24-hour, toll-free telephone help line for
employees for the purpose of requesting assistance concerning, or reporting
violations of, this Code or reporting complaints about accounting or auditing
matters. The number is: 1-800-813-8180.

Assistance is available during regular business hours. If you call outside of
regular business hours, you may leave a confidential message and your call will
be returned the following business day. Special security measures have been
taken with this help line to ensure confidentiality. If you wish to remain
anonymous, you may request a case identification number and refer to that number
in subsequent phone calls.

Obligation to Report

Employees are obligated to report suspected violations of this Code to their
department head, the Chief Compliance Officer or the Law Department.

Whistleblower Protection

No retaliation or retribution of any kind will be taken against an employee who,
in good faith, reports a suspected violation of this Code.

Investigation

All allegations of suspected violations will be promptly investigated and
appropriate action will be taken. Investigations will be conducted in an
objective, professional manner. The specifics of an investigation, including the
identity of the individual reporting the information, will be kept confidential
except as such disclosure is necessary to fully investigate the allegations,
facilitate resolution and/or report the results to appropriate authorities.

Disclosure to Government Authorities

Certain actions and omissions prohibited by this Code may also violate criminal
laws and may subject violators to criminal prosecution. The Law Department will
review the results of investigations that indicate potential violations of
criminal law and recommend to the appropriate senior officers whether disclosure
to appropriate enforcement authorities is warranted.

Disciplinary Action for Violations

Failure to adhere to this Code, other Company policies or applicable laws or
government regulations may result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment. Situations in which disciplinary action may be
appropriate include the following, insofar as they relate to conduct of the
Company's business:

..    authorization of or participation in activities that violate the law,
     government regulations, this Code or other Company policies;

..    retaliation, direct or indirect, or encouragement of others to retaliate
     against a Company employee who reports a suspected violation;

..    failure to cooperate with an investigation of suspected violations,
     including interfering with or obstructing an investigation; and

..    failure to report a suspected violation of the law, government regulations,
     this Code or other Company policies.

You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance

realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a
return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all
of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of
capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment
performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income."

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only
estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual
amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a
Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these
distributions for federal income tax purposes.

amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a
Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these
distributions for federal income tax purposes.

(1)YTD February 1, 2009 to January 11, 2010. (The distribution paid on
   January 12, 2009 was reportable for tax on Form 1099 in 2008)

The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a
return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all
of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of
capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment
performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income."

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only
estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual
amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a
Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these
distributions for federal income tax purposes.
