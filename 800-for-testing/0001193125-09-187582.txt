               FUND DISTRIBUTIONS AND MANAGED DISTRIBUTION PLAN

   The Fund has a Managed Distribution Plan to pay 10% of the Fund's net asset
value on an annualized basis. Distributions may represent earnings from net
investment income, realized capital gains, or, if necessary, return of capital.
The board believes that regular monthly, fixed cash payouts will enhance
shareholder value and serve the long-term interests of shareholders. You should
not draw any conclusions about the Fund's investment performance from the
amount of the distributions or from the terms of the Fund's Managed
Distribution Plan.

   The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net
realized capital gains in the fiscal year to date; therefore, a portion of your
distributions may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for
example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid
back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the
Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with "yield" or
"income".

   The amounts and sources of distributions reported in Section 19(a) notices
of the 1940 Act are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting
purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting
purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder
of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The
Fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will
tell you how to report distributions for federal income tax purposes.

   The Board may amend, suspend or terminate the Managed Distribution Plan at
any time, without prior notice to shareholders if it deems such action to be in
the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Dear Fellow ZTR Shareholder:

   I am pleased to share with you the manager's report and commentary for the
Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. for the six-months ended June 30, 2009.

   The Zweig Total Return Fund's net asset value gained 7.28% for the quarter
ended June 30, 2009, including $0.097 in reinvested distributions. During the
same period, the Fund's Composite Index gained 6.67% including reinvested
dividends. The Fund's average exposure for the quarter was approximately 44% in
bonds and 40% in equities.

   For the six-months ended June 30, 2009, the Fund's net asset value increased
4.36%, including $0.192 in reinvested distributions. During the same period,
the Fund's Composite Index increased 0.39% including reinvested dividends. The
Fund's average exposure for the first half was approximately 44% in bonds and
39% in equities.

          Sincerely,

          /s/ George R. Aylward
          George R. Aylward
          President, Chairman and
          Chief Executive Officer
          The Zweig Total Return
          Fund, Inc.
                          MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

   The Fund's bond exposure on June 30, 2009 was approximately 44%, with
average duration (a measure of sensitivity to interest rates) of 3.3 years. On
March 31, 2009 we held approximately 46% in bonds with average duration of 3.6
years. If we were fully invested, we would be 50% in bonds and 50% in stocks.
Consequently, at 44%, we are at about 88% of a full position (44%/50%).

   The first six-months of the year were dismal for Treasury Bonds. During the
first two quarters the yield of the ten-year Treasury note climbed from 2.21%
to 3.54%. For the first half, the ten-year Treasury's total return was -8.74%.
The second quarter alone saw a total return of -6.19% in ten-year Treasury
notes. Even the more diversified Barclay's Treasury Index showed a 4.31% loss
for the first half.

   Massive government deficit spending is putting upward pressure on interest
rates. Government demand for money, in the form of more debt, increases
borrowing costs. Another factor in the sell-off in Treasury securities was the
concern of investors that China and other large sovereign buyers of Treasuries
might dump them on the fear of a massive U.S. budget deficit. China has become
a large owner of U.S. Treasury debt. If it were to either stop buying, or
worse, sell its bonds, rates would likely skyrocket. Furthermore, the dollar
has been weak because the government has been borrowing and lending money at
such a high rate.

   Better news was found in other segments of the fixed income market, which
actually performed quite well for the first half. As the worries of a total
financial meltdown abated, and

                                       2

other credit markets eased, investors moved from Government bonds to higher
yielding corporate bonds. The second quarter was especially kind to corporate
bonds and the Merrill Corporate Bond Index rose 10.84% /(1)/. Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) also saw a small total return gain of
0.65% in the second quarter. Barclay's Inflation Note Index, after a strong
first quarter, reported its TIPS index up 6.21%/(1)/ for the first half.

   Concerned about the massive stimulus and the huge monetary liquidity being
poured into the system, we moved late last year into TIPS and away from regular
Treasury bonds. In our view, they offered a much better risk-reward profile,
yet had the credit worthiness of their plain vanilla Treasury counterparts if
the crisis deepened. As it turns out, they have had a very good run and
performed much better than the vanilla alternative.

   Our portfolio managers also added corporate bonds to our holdings early in
the first quarter. Because we also added some selective credit exposure, the
bonds portion of the Fund performed very well in the first half. While the
overall duration had remained stable most of the year, the move away from
Treasury coupon bonds into TIPS and corporate bonds has helped the Fund's
overall performance.

   Our exposure to U.S. common stocks was approximately 39% on June 30, 2009,
unchanged from the levels at the end of the first quarter. At 39%, we are at
about 78% of a full position (39%/50%).

   The stock market came to life in the second quarter of 2009 but still has a
long road to climb for a full recovery. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed
the quarter at 8,447, a gain of 838 points, or 11%/(1)/, from the previous
three months. It was the Dow's best quarterly performance since the fourth
quarter of 2003. However, the Dow closed down 3.8%/(1)/ for the first half and
is still 40%/(1)/ below its all-time high of 14,168 in October 2007. It would
take three more rallies like the second quarter's to regain that peak.
Incidentally, in early June, the Dow Index dropped General Motors and Citicorp
from its line-up of thirty blue-chip companies and replaced them with Cisco
Systems and Travelers Companies.

   The other major indexes outperformed the Dow. The NASDAQ Composite ended the
quarter at 1,835.04, up 20%/(1)/ from the prior three months and 16.4%
/(1)/ higher for the first half. Also doing well, the S&P 500 closed at 919.32,
a gain of 15.2%/(1)/ for the quarter and 1.8%/(1)/ for the year.

   World-wide, the markets also rallied in the second quarter. Europe saw
Britain's FTSE gain 8%/(1)/, Germany's DAX 18%,/(1)/ with France's CAC 40 up
12%/(1)/. In Asia, Japan's NIKKEI Stock Average at 220 Companies and China's
benchmark Shanghai Index each surged 25%/(1)/. India was the top scorer, with
its benchmark SENSEX soaring 49%/(1)/.

   On the domestic side, the Federal Reserve noted signs of slower economic
contraction and improved financial conditions. It said it would keep its key
interest rate at virtually zero for "an extended period" and leave its rescue
programs unchanged. While stating that "economic activity is likely to remain
weak for a time," it added that it expects current fiscal and stimulus policies
to "contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a
context of price stability."

   The housing market, a key element in the economy, witnessed some encouraging
developments. The Commerce Department reported that construction of new homes
increased to an annual rate of 530,000 in May, a gain of 17.2% from April but
still 45.2% below the pace a year ago. Pending home sales in May increased to
the highest level since last September, according to the National Association
of Realtors.

   Another positive note was sounded by the Institute for Supply Management
("ISM"). It reported that its manufacturing index was up to


                                      3

<PAGE>


44.8 in June from 42.8 in May to its strongest level since last September. This
figure is still below 50, indicating contraction. The Commerce Department
reported that orders for durable goods in May increased 1.8%, matching the gain
in April, and rising for the third time in four months. However, orders are
still down 27% from a year ago.

   While there were some hopeful signs for the economy, the climbing jobless
rate indicated that the recession, which started in December 2007, the longest
since the 1930s, has not relaxed its grip. The Labor Department reported that
an additional 487,000 jobs were lost in June and the unemployment rate moved up
to 9.5%. Since the recession began, the U.S. has lost 6.5 million jobs,
bringing total U.S. employment to its lowest point since August 2004.

   Reflecting the disappointing employment picture, the Conference Board
reported that its index of consumer attitudes fell to 49.3 in June from 54.8 in
May. Its survey found that Americans saying jobs are "hard to get" rose to
44.8% in June from 43.9% the previous month, while those saying jobs are
"plentiful" dipped to 4.5% in June from 5.8% in May.

   Indicating that inflation may be in check, the Labor Department reported
that its Consumer Price Index ("CPI") rose only 0.1% in May following an
unchanged rate in April. Compared to a year ago, the CPI was down 1.3%, the
biggest drop since 1950. The Government also reported that producer prices
increased a less-than-expected 0.2% in May. Excluding food and energy, the core
rate declined 0.1%.

   The U.S. gross domestic product ("GDP") has declined at a slower rate than
originally forecast. The Commerce Department, which originally reported that
the GDP fell at a 6.1% annual rate in the first quarter of 2009, has revised
that estimate to 5.5%. Both figures are an improvement over the 6.3% drop in
the GDP annual rate in the first quarter of 2008.

   While the rate of economic contraction may be slowing, the environment is
still not conducive to mergers and acquisitions. U.S. deal volume in the second
quarter slid 57% to $144.7 billion from $334.9 billion last year, according to
Dealogic. It is the lowest second quarter level since 2003. There were 1,489
domestic deals in the quarter against 1,916 a year earlier. The same pattern
played out world-wide, with deal volume declining to $1.2 trillion, off 28%
from the 2008 second quarter, and deals crumbled 24% to 15,880.

   Initial public offerings ("IPO") in the U.S. were also weak. There were 10
IPOs valued at $1.3 billion in the second quarter against 11 offerings that
raised $4.2 billion in the 2008 period, according to Dealogic. The picture was
brighter world-wide, which saw 78 deals raising $10.6 billion, up from 54 deals
raising $1.3 billion in the like quarter last year.

   There was no good news in the U.S. balance of trade. The trade deficit
expanded in April, the last month for which figures are available, to $29.2
billion from $28.5 billion in March, according to the Commerce Department. U.S.
exports fell $2.8 billion to $121.1 billion while imports slipped $2.2 billion
to $150.3 billion.

   The dollar ended a year-long rally in the second quarter, losing 5.37% of
its value against the euro and falling 2.66% against the Japanese yen. Measured
against a trade-weighted group of currencies tracked by J.P. Morgan Chase, the
dollar declined 5.5%. It was the first loss since the initial quarter of 2008.
On the plus side, the weaker dollar should help U.S. exports and boost the
revenues of American companies doing business abroad.

   Wall Street analysts on average, expect second-quarter operating profits of
the S&P 500 Companies to finish down 34.9% from a year ago, according to
Thomson Reuters. It would mark the eighth consecutive year-to-year decline.
After a weak third quarter, analysts see a "really

<PAGE>


strong" fourth quarter. For all of this year, profits were projected to shrink
11% and then rebound and grow 27% for 2010.

   With earnings soft, companies are cutting back on dividends. Standard and
Poors ("S&P") reported that among the approximately 7,000 publicly-owned
corporations it surveyed, there were only 233 payment enhancements (including
increases, extras and redemptions) in the second quarter. This was a drop of
48.8% from the 455 last year and an all-time quarterly low. At the same time,
250 companies either reduced or skipped dividends compared with 97 in the same
quarter of 2008. It was the highest figure since the 272 in the second quarter
of 1958. Looking to the future, Howard Silverblatt, S&P senior index analyst,
said "until we see the economy better, and not just for one quarter, many
companies will remain gun-shy about parting with their cash."

   At the end of the second quarter, companies in the S&P 500 were trading at
14.6 times earnings. This compared with P/Es of 12.9 in March 31, 2009 and 18.8
at the start of the year. The recent ratio is higher because the "price"
component has increased while the "earnings" component has declined. As we see
it, recent P/Es are somewhere between average value and somewhat overvalued.

   A slightly less pessimistic outlook for the U.S. economy was provided in the
International Monetary Fund's ("IMF") annual review. IMF now forecasts a 2.5%
contraction this year, an improvement from the April view of a 2.8% decline.
For all of next year, the agency raised its estimate of growth from 0 to 0.75%.

   Looking toward the future of the stock market, analysts are more optimistic
than investors. Analysts surveyed by Investors Intelligence showed 41.4% bulls
and 29.9% bears on June 30. Meanwhile, members of the American Institute of
Investors had a different perspective, with only 37.8% bulls and 44.6% bears.

   This market and the economy seem to be tracking the early 30s. The
difference is that the government rescue programs have truncated the risk of
depression. They seem to have turned things around to a degree. Although the
economy is better than it was a few months ago, we don't know whether it will
fully recover. The problem with all the stimulus is that it could lead to
inflation. If it doesn't work, it could result in deflation. In either case, we
would see problems for the stock market.

   There was a pretty good market bottom in March but we can't be sure that it
was a real bottom. We are not convinced that this is a new bull market.
Consequently, our posture is still neutral.

              Sincerely,

                                                  [GRAPHIC]

/(2)/ Please note that the tax status of the distributions is determined at the
      end of the taxable year. However, based on interim data as of June 30,
      2009, we estimate 10% of the distributions represents net investment
      income and 0% represents excess gain distributions which are taxed as
      ordinary income and 90% represents return of capital. Also refer to the
      inside front cover for the Managed Distribution Plan and Note 2D in the

(1)Closing Price -- New York Stock Exchange.
(2)Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of a share of the
   Fund's common stock at the opening NYSE share price on the first business
   day and a sale at the closing NYSE share price on the last business day of
   each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
   the purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
   the Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan. Generally, total
   investment return based on net asset value will be higher than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is an
   increase in the discount or a decrease in the premium of the market value to
   the net assets from the beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely,
   total investment return based on net asset value will be lower than total
   investment return based on market value in periods where there is a decrease
   in the discount or an increase in the premium of the market value to the net
   asset value from the beginning to the end of such periods.
(3)Computed using average shares outstanding.
(4)Shares were sold at a 5% discount from a 5-day average market price from
   5/14/07 to 5/18/07.
(5)Total investment return includes the dilutive effect of the rights offering.
   Without this effect, the total investment return would have been (13.82)%.
(6)Amount is less than $0.005.
(7)NAV return is calculated using the opening Net Asset Value price of the
   Fund's common stock on the first business day and the closing Net Asset
   Value price of the Fund's common stock on the last business day of each
   period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for the
   purpose of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
   Fund's Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan.
(8)Annualized.
(9)Not annualized.
(10)Please note that the tax status of the distributions is determined at the
    end of the taxable year. However, based on interim data as of June 30,
    2009, we estimate 10% of the distributions represents net investment income
    and 0% represents excess gain distributions which are taxed as ordinary
    income and 90% represents return of capital. Also refer to the inside front
    cover for the Managed Distribution Plan and Note 2D in the notes to
    financial statements.

                       THE ZWEIG TOTAL RETURN FUND, INC.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                 June 30, 2009
                                  (Unaudited)

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

   The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a closed-end, diversified
management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"). The Fund was incorporated under the laws of the State of
Maryland on July 21, 1988. The Fund's investment objective is to seek the
highest total return, consisting of capital appreciation and current income,
consistent with the preservation of capital.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principals
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amount of increases and decreases in
net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates and those differences could be significant.

  A. Security Valuation:

   Equity securities are valued at the official closing price (typically last
sale) on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or if no
closing price is available, at the last bid price.

   Debt securities are valued on the basis of broker quotations or valuations
provided by a pricing service, which utilizes information with respect to
recent sales, market transactions in comparable securities, quotations from
dealers, and various relationships between securities in determining value. Due
to the continued volatility in the current market, valuations developed through
pricing techniques may materially vary from the actual amounts realized upon
sale of the securities.

   As required, some securities and other assets may be valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Directors.

   Certain foreign common stocks may be fair valued in cases where closing
prices are not readily available or are deemed not reflective of readily
available market prices. For example, significant events (such as movement in
the U.S. securities market, or other regional and local developments) may occur
between the time that foreign markets close (where the security is principally
traded) and the time that the Fund calculates its net asset value (generally,
the close of the NYSE) that may impact the value of securities traded in these
foreign markets. In these cases, information from an external vendor may be
utilized to adjust closing market prices of certain foreign common stocks to
reflect their fair value. Because the frequency of significant events is not
predictable, fair valuation of certain foreign common stocks may occur on a
frequent basis.

   Investments in underlying money market mutual funds are valued at each
fund's closing net asset value.

   Short-term investments having a remaining maturity of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market.

                                      19

<PAGE>



   The Fund has adopted the provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 157 ("SFAS 157"). This standard clarifies the definition of fair
value for financial reporting, establishes a framework for measuring fair value
and requires additional disclosures about the use of fair value measurements.
To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and
related disclosures, the Fund utilizes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes
the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad
levels:

   .   Level 1 -- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

   .   Level 2 -- prices determined using other significant observable inputs
       (including quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates,
       prepayment speeds, credit risk, etc.)

   .   Level 3 -- prices determined using significant unobservable inputs
       (including the Fund's own assumptions in determining the fair value of
       investments)

   In April 2009, FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. 157-4, Determining Fair
Value when the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have
Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly ("FSP
157-4"). The Fund has adopted FSP 157-4 effective with this report. FSP 157-4
provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with SFAS
157, when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have
significantly decreased. FSP 157-4 also includes guidance on identifying
circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly. FSP 157-4 requires
entities to describe the inputs used in valuation techniques used to measure
fair value and changes in inputs over the period. FSP 157-4 expands the
three-level hierarchy disclosure and the level three roll-forward disclosure
for each major security type as described in paragraph 19 of FAS No. 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.

   The following table provides a summary of the inputs used to value the
Fund's net assets as of June 30, 2009, as required under SFAS 157 and FAS 157-4.

</TABLE>

   There were no Level 3 (Significant unobservable input) priced securities.

   The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

  B. Security Transactions and Related Income:

   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Dividend income is
recorded on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign securities,
as soon as the Fund is notified. Interest

                                      20

<PAGE>


income is recorded on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and
accretes discounts using the effective interest method. Realized gains and
losses are determined on the identified cost basis.

  C. Income Taxes:

   It is the policy of the Fund to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M
of the Internal Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes or
excise taxes has been made.

   The Fund may be subject to foreign taxes on income, gains on investments or
currency repatriation, a portion of which may be recoverable. The Fund will
accrue such taxes and recoveries as applicable based upon current
interpretations of the tax rules and regulations that exist in the markets in
which it invests.

   FASB Interpretation No. 48, ("FIN 48") Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes, sets forth a minimum threshold for financial statement recognition of
the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Management has analyzed the Fund's tax positions and has concluded that no
provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial statements. The
Fund is not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that
the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change in the
next twelve months. Each of the Fund's federal tax returns for the prior three
fiscal years remains subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service.

  D. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders:

   Distributions are recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These differences may include the treatment of
non-taxable dividends, market premium and discount, non-deductible expenses,
expiring capital loss carryovers, foreign currency gain or loss, operating
losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. Permanent book and tax basis
differences relating to shareholder distributions will result in
reclassifications to capital paid in on shares of beneficial interest.

  E. Foreign Currency Translation:

   Foreign securities and other assets and liabilities are valued using the
foreign currency exchange rate effective at the end of the reporting period.
Cost of investments is translated at the currency exchange rate effective at
the trade date. The gain or loss resulting from a change in currency exchange
rates between the trade and settlement dates of a portfolio transaction is
treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. Likewise, the gain or loss
resulting from a change in currency exchange rates between the date income is
accrued and paid is treated as a gain or loss on foreign currency. The Fund
does not isolate that portion of the results of operations arising from changes
in exchange rates and that portion arising from changes in the market prices of
securities.

  F. Financial Accounting Standards No. 161

   In March 2008, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
161; "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("FAS
161"). The Fund has adopted the provisions of Statement 161 during the current
fiscal year. This statement is intended to improve financial reporting for
derivative instruments by requiring enhanced disclosure that enables investors
to understand how and why a fund uses derivatives, how derivatives are
accounted for, and how derivative instruments affect a fund's results of
operations and financial position. The adoption of Statement 161 did not have a
material impact on the amounts reported in the Fund's financial statements.

                                      21

  G. Security Lending:

   The Fund may loan securities to qualified brokers through an agreement with
State Street Bank and Trust Company (the "Custodian"). Under the terms of
agreement, the Fund is required to maintain collateral with a market value not
less than 100% of the market value of loaned securities. Collateral is adjusted
daily in connection with changes in the market value of securities on loan.
Collateral may consist of cash, securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
Government or its agencies, sovereign debt of foreign countries and/or
irrevocable letters of credit issued by banks. Cash collateral is invested in a
short-term money market fund. Dividends earned on the collateral and premiums
paid by the broker are recorded as income by the Fund net of fees and rebates
charged by the Custodian for its services in connection with this securities
lending program. Lending portfolio securities involves a risk of delay in the
recovery of the loaned securities or in the foreclosure on collateral.

   At June 30, 2009, the Fund had no securities on loan.

NOTE 4 -- INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   At end of business December 31, 2008, Virtus Investment Partners, Inc.
("Virtus") spun off from The Phoenix Companies, Inc., into an independent
publicly traded company. Virtus is the holding company for various asset
management subsidiaries, including Zweig Advisers, LLC (the "Adviser", formerly
known as Phoenix/Zweig Advisers LLC) and VP Distributors, Inc. ("VP
Distributors", formerly known as Phoenix Equity Planning Corporation). Due to
the spin-off, the asset management subsidiaries have changed their names.

   a) Investment Advisory Fee: The Investment Advisory Agreement (the
"Agreement") between the Adviser and the Fund provides that, subject to the
direction of the Board of Directors of the Fund and the applicable provisions
of the Act, the adviser is responsible for the actual management of the Fund's
portfolio. The responsibility for making decisions to buy, sell, or hold a
particular investment rests with the Adviser, subject to review by the Board of
Directors and the applicable provisions of the Act. For the services provided
by the Adviser under the Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee
equal, on an annual basis to 0.70% of the Fund's average daily net assets.
During the six-months ended June 30, 2009, the Fund incurred advisory fees of
$1,532 (reported in thousands).

                                      22

<PAGE>



   Zweig Consulting LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), which serves as the Sub-Adviser
for the Fund, performs certain asset allocation research and analysis and
provides such advice to the Adviser. The Sub-Adviser's fees are paid by the
Adviser.

   b) Administration Fee: VP Distributors serves as the Fund's Administrator
(the "Administrator") pursuant to an Administration Agreement. The
Administrator receives a fee for financial reporting, tax services, and
oversight of the subagents' performance at a rate of 0.065% of the Fund's
average daily net assets. During the six-months ended June 30, 2009, the Fund
incurred Administration fees of $142 (reported in thousands).

   c) Directors Fee: During the period the Fund paid each Director who is not
an interested person of the Fund or the Adviser a fee of $11,000 per year plus
$1,500 per Directors' or committee meeting attended, together with the
out-of-pocket costs relating to attendance at such meetings. The co-lead
Directors are paid an additional $10,000 retainer each per year. The Audit
Committee chairperson is paid an additional $5,000 retainer per year. Any
Director of the Fund who is an interested person of the Fund or the Adviser
receives no remuneration from the Fund.

NOTE 5 -- INDEMNIFICATIONS

   Under the Fund's organizational documents and related agreements, its
directors and officers are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out
of the performance of their duties to the Fund. In addition, the Fund enters
into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these arrangements.

NOTE 6 -- CAPITAL STOCK AND REINVESTMENT PLAN

   At June 30, 2009, the Fund had one class of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of which 500,000,000 shares are authorized and 114,594,744 shares
are outstanding.

   Registered shareholders may elect to have all distributions paid by check
mailed directly to the shareholder by Computershare as dividend paying agent.
Pursuant to the Automatic Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan"),
shareholders not making such election will have all such amounts automatically
reinvested by Computershare, as the Plan agent, in whole or fractional shares
of the Fund, as the case may be. During the six-months ended June 30, 2009 and
the year ended December 31, 2008, there were no shares issued pursuant to the
Plan.

   In a non-transferable rights offering ended May 18, 2007, shareholders
exercised rights to purchase 20,730,142 shares of common stock at an offering
price of $4.98 per share for proceeds, net of expenses, of $102,586,107.
Expenses were adjusted by $15,058 in 2008, resulting in final net proceeds of
$102,571,049.

   On July 1, 2009, the Fund announced a distribution of $0.033 per share to
shareholders of record on July 13, 2009. This distribution has an ex-dividend
date of July 9, 2009, and is payable on July 27, 2009. Please see inside front
cover for more information on fund distributions.

NOTE 8 -- CREDIT RISK AND ASSET CONCENTRATIONS

   In countries with limited or developing markets, investments may present
greater risks than in more developed markets and the prices of such investments
may be volatile. The consequences of political, social or economic changes in
these markets may have disruptive effects on the market prices of these
investments and the income they generate, as well as the Fund's ability to
repatriate such amounts.

   The Fund may invest a high percentage of its assets in specific sectors of
the market in its pursuit of a greater investment return. Fluctuations in these
sectors of concentration may have a greater impact on the Fund, positive or
negative, than if the Fund did not concentrate its investments in such sectors.

NOTE 9 -- REGULATORY EXAMS

   Federal and state regulatory authorities from time to time make inquiries
and conduct examinations regarding compliance by Virtus and its subsidiaries
(collectively "the Company") with securities and other laws and regulations
affecting their registered products.

   There are currently no such matters which the Company believes will be
material to these financial statements.

NOTE 10 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT EVALUATIONS

   In May 2009, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 165 ("FAS 165")
regarding Subsequent Events was issued and is effective with interim or annual
financial periods ending after June 15, 2009. FAS 165 is intended to introduce
the concept of the financial statements being available to be issued as a
measurement date for evaluating subsequent events.

   Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Funds
through August 21, 2009, the date the financial statements were issued, and is
reporting that The Zweig Total Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") announced on July
22, 2009, that, as required by its Articles of Incorporation, it will submit to
a shareholder vote to the Fund's shareholders of record at the close of
business on August 13, 2009, a proposal that the Fund convert from a closed-end
fund to an open-end fund because its shares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange during the quarter ended June 30, 2009, at an average discount from
their net asset value of 10% or more, determined on the basis of the discount
as of the end of the last trading day in each week during such quarter. The
conversion proposal would require the affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares to carry for approval.

                    BOARD CONSIDERATION AND RE-APPROVAL OF
             INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND SERVICING AGREEMENT

   Pursuant to Section 15(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended
(the "1940 Act"), the Board of Directors (the "Board") of The Zweig Total
Return Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), including a majority of the Directors who have
no direct or indirect interest in the investment advisory agreement and are not
"interested persons" of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act (the "Independent
Directors"), are required to annually review and re-approve the terms of the
Fund's existing investment advisory agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with
Zweig Advisers LLC (the "Adviser") and the servicing agreement (the "Servicing
Agreement") between the Adviser and Zweig Consulting LLC (the "Sub-Adviser")
(collectively, the "Agreements"). In this regard, the Board reviewed and
re-approved, during the most recent six month period covered by this report,
the Agreements.

   More specifically, at a meeting held on February 9-10, 2009, the Board,
including the Independent Directors, considered the factors and reached the
conclusions described below relating to the selection of the Adviser and the
Sub-Adviser and the re-approval of the Agreements.

   1. Nature, Extent and Quality of Services. The Independent Directors
considered the nature, extent and quality of the services performed by the
Adviser and the Sub-Adviser, including portfolio management, supervision of
Fund operations and compliance and regulatory filings and disclosures to
shareholders, general oversight of other service providers, review of Fund
legal issues, assisting the Directors in that capacity and other services. The
Independent Directors concluded that the services are extensive in nature and
that the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser delivered an acceptable level of service.

   2. Investment Performance of the Fund and Adviser. The Independent Directors
considered the investment performance for the Fund over various periods of time
as compared to the Lipper, Inc. performance groups and performance universe,
and concluded that the Adviser was delivering acceptable performance results
consistent with the long-term investment strategies being pursued by the Fund.
The Independent Directors had been informed that the Adviser and its affiliates
did not manage any fund comparable to the Fund against which the Fund's
performance could be compared.

   3. Costs of Services and Profits Realized by the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser.

   (a) Costs of Services to Fund: Fees and Expenses. The Independent Directors
considered the Fund's management fee rate and expense ratios relative to that
Fund's Lipper, Inc. expense group. The Independent Directors concluded that
those fees are acceptable based upon the qualifications, experience, reputation
and performance of the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser. The Independent Directors
also concluded that the expense ratio of the Fund was within an acceptable
range relative to its Lipper, Inc. expense group.

   (b) Profitability and Costs of Services to Adviser and Sub-Adviser. The
Independent Directors considered the Adviser's and Sub-Adviser's overall
profitability and costs. The Independent Directors also considered whether the
amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit. The Independent Directors
concluded that the Adviser's and the Sub-Adviser's profitability was at an
acceptable level in light of the quality of the services being provided to the
Fund.

   4. Extent of Economies of Scale as the Fund Grows. The Independent Directors
considered whether there have been economies of scale with respect to the
management of the Fund and whether

                                      25

<PAGE>


such Fund has appropriately benefited from any economies of scale. The
Independent Directors noted that economies of scale may develop for certain
funds as their assets increase and their Fund-level expenses decline as a
percentage of assets, but that closed-end funds such as the Fund typically do
not have the ability to substantially increase their asset base as do mutual
funds. The Independent Directors concluded that the Fund has appropriately
benefited from any economies of scale.

   5. Whether Fee Levels Reflect Economies of Scale. The Independent Directors
also considered whether the management fee rate is reasonable in relation to
the asset size of the Fund and any economies of scale that may exist, and
concluded that, given the Fund's closed-end structure, it was. At the same
time, the Directors agreed that it would be appropriate to monitor this issue
in the event that the assets of the Fund were to increase substantially via a
rights offering or some other means.

   6. Other Relevant Considerations.

   (a) Adviser Personnel and Methods. The Independent Directors considered the
size, education and experience of the Adviser's and Sub-Adviser's staff, their
fundamental research capabilities and approach to recruiting, training and
retaining portfolio managers and other research and management personnel, and
concluded that in each of these areas they were structured in such a way to
support the level of services being provided to the Fund.

   (b) Other Benefits to the Adviser or Sub-Adviser. The Independent Directors
also considered the character and amount of other incidental benefits received
by the Adviser and the Sub-Adviser and their respective affiliates from their
association with the Fund. The Independent Directors concluded that potential
"fall-out" benefits that they may receive, such as greater name recognition or
increased ability to obtain research or brokerage services, appear to be
reasonable, and may in some cases benefit the Fund.

Conclusions

   In considering the Agreements, the Independent Directors did not identify
any factor as all-important or all-controlling and instead considered these
factors collectively in light of the Fund's surrounding circumstances. Based on
this review, it was the judgment of the Independent Directors that shareholders
had received acceptable absolute and relative performance at reasonable fees
and, therefore, re-approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement with the
Adviser and the Servicing Agreement with the Sub-Adviser were in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a part of their decision-making
process, the Independent Directors noted their belief that a long-term
relationship with capable, conscientious advisers is in the best interests of
the Fund. The Independent Directors considered, generally, that shareholders
invested in a Fund knowing that the Adviser managed that Fund and knowing its
investment management fee schedule. As such, the Independent Directors
considered, in particular, whether the Adviser, with the assistance of the
Sub-Adviser, managed the Fund in accordance with its investment objectives and
policies as disclosed to shareholders, and concluded that the Fund was so
managed.

   Upon conclusion of their review and discussion, the Independent Directors,
voting separately, and the full Board unanimously approved the continuation of
the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Service Agreement.

realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a
return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all
of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of
capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment
performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income."

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only
estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual
amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a
Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these
distributions for federal income tax purposes.

return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all
of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of
capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund's investment
performance and should not be confused with "yield" or "income."

The amounts and sources of distributions reported in this Notice are only
estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual
amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon
the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and
may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a
Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these
distributions for federal income tax purposes.
