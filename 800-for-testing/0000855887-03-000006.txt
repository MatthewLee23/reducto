LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Dear Shareholder:

This  semiannual  report  for Dreyfus Strategic Municipal Bond Fund, Inc. covers
the six-month period from December 1, 2002, through May 31, 2003. Inside, you'll
find  valuable  information  about how the fund was managed during the reporting
period, including a discussion with the fund's portfolio manager, James Welch.

We  have  recently  seen  some signs of stability in the U.S. financial markets.
Perhaps  most  important, the war in Iraq wound down quickly, without disrupting
oil  supplies  or  major  incidents of terrorism. Many stock market indices have
posted  encouraging  gains  since  the  start  of 2003, although it is uncertain
whether such gains will continue. At the same time, an estimated $350 billion in
federal  tax  cuts  were  signed  into  law  on May 28, and the evidence to date
suggests  that  any  adverse  impact on municipal bond yields should be minimal.
Indeed,  rising state and local taxes may make municipal bonds more valuable for
investors seeking tax-exempt income.

Of  course,  problems and concerns remain. In the U.S. economy, unemployment has
risen  to  multiyear highs, and corporations remain reluctant to spend. Positive
factors  appear to outweigh negative ones, however, and we believe that the U.S.
economy is on the path to recovery.

What  are the implications for your investments? We believe that municipal bonds
may  benefit  as  state  and local tax rates rise, making tax-exempt yields more
attractive  compared  to  taxable  yields  for many investors. At the same time,
because  of  ongoing  fiscal pressures affecting many states and municipalities,
diversification  remains  important.  As  for  stocks, we currently believe that
selectivity  among  individual  companies  can  be  a  key  factor in the equity
markets.  However,  no  one  can say for certain what direction the markets will
take  over  time.  Your  financial  advisor  can  help  you  to ensure that your
portfolio  reflects  your investment needs, long-term goals and attitudes toward
risk.

Thank you for your continued confidence and support.

Sincerely,


/s/Stephen E. Canter

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE

James Welch, Portfolio Manager

How did Dreyfus Strategic Municipal Bond Fund, Inc. perform during the period?

For the six-month period ended May 31, 2003, the fund achieved a total return of
9.59% .(1)  During the same period, the fund provided aggregate income dividends
of $0.2974 per share, which is equal to a distribution rate of 6.57%.(2)

The  fund  and  market's  performance during the reporting period was primarily
influenced   by   declining  interest  rates,  heightened  investor  demand  for
tax-exempt  fixed-income  securities  and mounting fiscal pressures on state and
local governments. The fund's investment returns were enhanced by our leveraging
strategy, which benefited from historically low borrowing rates.

What is the fund's investment approach?

The fund seeks to maximize  current income exempt from federal income tax to the
extent believed by Dreyfus to be consistent with the preservation of capital. In
pursuing  this goal,  the fund  invests at least 80% of its assets in  municipal
bonds. Municipal bonds are classified as general obligation bonds, revenue bonds
and notes. Under normal market conditions,  the fund invests at least 80% of its
net assets in investment-grade bonds.

We look for bonds that we believe can provide high current income.  We strive to
find such opportunities through analysis of individual bonds' structures. Within
the context of our bond structure analyses,  we pay particularly close attention
to each bond's maturity and early redemption features.

Over time, many of the fund's older,  higher-yielding bonds have matured or were
redeemed by their issuers.  We have  generally  attempted to replace those bonds
with new securities that offered  currently higher than average income payments.
We have also sought to
                                                                        The Fund


DISCUSSION OF FUND PERFORMANCE (CONTINUED)

upgrade  the  fund  with  newly  issued  bonds that, in our opinion, have better
structural   or   income  characteristics  than  existing  holdings.  When  such
opportunities  arise,  we  usually  sell  bonds  that are close to their optimal
redemption  date  or  maturity.  In  addition, we conduct credit analysis of our
holdings  in  an  attempt  to avoid potential defaults on interest and principal
payments.

What other factors influenced the fund's performance?

The  reporting  period  was characterized by persistent economic weakness, which
was  aggravated  by corporate scandals early in the reporting period and, later,
heightened  international  tensions  culminating in the war in Iraq. Despite the
Federal  Reserve Board's aggressively accommodative monetary policy, the economy
failed  to gain much momentum after the Iraq war wound down in early April 2003,
and  municipal  bond  yields  continued to decline. Lower yields on newly issued
bonds produced price appreciation for seasoned bonds, contributing positively to
the  fund' s total return. Lower yields and higher prices were also supported by
high  levels  of  investor  demand  for relatively stable, tax-exempt investment
alternatives.

The  weak economy also produced negative influences affecting the municipal bond
market.  Most  notably, revenues from personal income taxes, capital gains taxes
and  sales  taxes  fell  short  of many states' and municipalities' projections,
creating  budget  deficits.  State  governments  have  attempted to bridge their
budget  gaps  through  spending  reductions  and,  in  some cases, higher taxes.
Government  entities  have  also  turned  to  the  municipal bond market to fund
ongoing  operations  and  new  projects. As a result, the supply of newly issued
bonds  during  the reporting period rose sharply compared to the same period one
year  earlier.  While a surge of new issuance historically has tended to produce
higher  yields,  the  reporting  period' s  increased supply of bonds was easily
absorbed by robust investor demand, and municipal bond yields generally remained
low.


In  this  challenging  fiscal  environment,  we  have  attempted to adopt a more
conservative   investment   posture.   We   reduced   the  fund' s  holdings  of
corporate-backed bonds and redeployed those assets primarily among high-quality,
income-oriented  bonds  that are more sensitive to interest-rate changes than to
investors' perception of credit quality.

Finally,  the fund benefited from lower short-term interest rates and a widening
of the difference between short-term rates and long-term bond yields. As part of
the fund's leveraging strategy, we extended the term of one of the fund's series
of  auction-rate  preferred  notes, effectively locking in today's low borrowing
rates  for  two  years.  By  reinvesting  the  proceeds  in municipal bonds with
long-term maturities, we have effectively enhanced the fund's income stream.

What is the fund's current strategy?

We  continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to upgrade the fund's credit quality
without  sacrificing  substantial amounts of current income. In the meantime, we
are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for municipal bonds in general and
the  fund' s  seasoned, core holdings in particular. In our current view, recent
federal  tax  cuts  are  likely to be offset by higher state and local taxes for
many  taxpayers.  New  York  and  Connecticut have already raised taxes to cover
their  budget  deficits, and other states are considering doing so. As a result,
tax-exempt  securities  may become more attractive to investors seeking tax-free
income.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

NOTE 1--Significant Accounting Policies:

Dreyfus Strategic Municipal Bond Fund, Inc. (the "fund") is registered under the
Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"), as a diversified
closed-end  management investment company. The fund's investment objective is to
maximize current income exempt from federal income tax to the extent believed by
the fund's investment adviser to be consistent with the preservation of capital.
The  Dreyfus Corporation ("Dreyfus") serves as the fund's investment adviser and
administrator.  Dreyfus is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mellon Bank, N.A., which
is  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mellon Financial Corporation ("Mellon"). Boston
Safe  Deposit  and Trust Company (the "Custodian") acts as the fund's custodian.
The  Custodian is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mellon. PFPC Global Fund Services
("PFPC"), a subsidiary of PNC Bank ("PNC"), serves as the fund's transfer agent,
dividend-paying  agent, registrar and plan agent. The fund's Common Stock trades
on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DSM.

The  fund  has outstanding 2,480 shares of Series A, Series B and Series C for a
total  of  7,440  shares  of Auction Preferred Stock ("APS"), with a liquidation
preference  of $25,000 per share (plus an amount equal to accumulated but unpaid
dividends  upon  liquidation) . APS  dividend  rates  are determined pursuant to
periodic auctions. Deutsche Bank, as Auction Agent, receives a fee from the fund
for  its  services  in  connection with such auctions. The fund also compensates
broker-dealers  generally at an annual rate of .25% of the purchase price of the
shares of APS placed by the broker-dealer in an auction.

The  fund  is  subject  to  certain restrictions relating to the APS. Failure to
comply  with  these  restrictions  could  preclude  the  fund from declaring any
distributions  to common shareholders or repurchasing common shares and/or could
trigger the mandatory redemption of APS at liquidation value.

The holders of the APS, voting as a separate  class,  have the right to elect at
least two directors. The holders of the APS vote as a separate

class  on  certain  other  matters,  as required by law. The fund has designated
Robin  A. Pringle and John E. Zuccotti to represent holders of APS on the fund's
Board of Directors.

The  fund's  financial  statements  are  prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States, which may require the use of
management  estimates  and  assumptions.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(a)  Portfolio  valuation:  Investments  in municipal debt securities (excluding
options  and  financial  futures  on municipal and U.S. Treasury securities) are
valued on the last business day of each week and month by an independent pricing
service  (the  "Service" ) approved  by  the Board of Directors. Investments for
which  quoted bid prices are readily available and are representative of the bid
side of the market in the judgment of the Service are valued at the mean between
the  quoted  bid  prices  (as  obtained  by  the  Service  from  dealers in such
securities)  and  asked  prices  (as  calculated  by  the Service based upon its
evaluation  of  the  market  for  such  securities) . Other  investments  (which
constitute  a majority of the portfolio securities) are carried at fair value as
determined  by  the  Service,  based  on methods which include consideration of:
yields or prices of municipal securities of comparable quality, coupon, maturity
and  type; indications as to values from dealers; and general market conditions.
Options  and  financial  futures  on  municipal  securities  and  U.S.  Treasury
securities  are  valued  at  the  last sales price on the securities exchange on
which  such  securities  are  primarily traded or at the last sales price on the
national  securities  market  on  the  last business day of each week and month

(b)  Securities  transactions and investment income: Securities transactions are
recorded  on  a  trade  date  basis.  Realized  gain  and  loss  from securities
transactions  are  recorded  on  the  identified  cost  basis.  Interest income,
adjusted for amortization of discount and premium on investments, is earned from
settlement  date  and  recognized  on the accrual basis. Securities purchased or
sold  on  a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be settled a month or more
after the trade date.

                                                             The Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (CONTINUED)

(c)  Dividends  to  shareholders  of  Common  Stock  (" Common Shareholder(s)"):
Dividends  are  recorded  on  the  ex-dividend  date.  Dividends from investment
income-net  are  declared  and paid monthly. Dividends from net realized capital
gain,  if  any,  are normally declared and paid at least annually. To the extent
that  net  realized capital gain can be offset by capital loss carryovers, it is
the policy of the fund not to distribute such gain.

For  common  shareholders who elect to receive their distributions in additional
shares  of  the  fund, in lieu of cash, such distributions will be reinvested at
the  lower  of  the market price or net asset value per share (but not less than
95%  of  the  market price) based on the record date's respective prices. If the
net  asset value per share on the record date is lower than the market price per
share, shares will be issued by the fund at the record date's net asset value on
the  payable date of the distribution. If net asset value per share is less than
95%  of the market value, shares will be issued by the fund at 95% of the market
value.  If  the market price is lower than the net assets value per share on the
record date, PFPC will purchase fund shares in the open market commencing on the
payable  date  and  reinvest those shares accordingly. As a result of purchasing
fund  shares in the open market, fund shares outstanding will not be affected by
this form of reinvestment.

On  May  31,  2003,  the  Board  of Directors declared a cash dividend to Common
Shareholders  of $.051 per share from investment income-net, payable on June 27,
2003  to  Common  Shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 13,
2003.

(d)  Dividends  to  Shareholders  of APS: For APS, dividends are currently reset
annually  for Series A and B and every 7 days for series C. The dividend rate in
effect  at  May 31, 2003 were as follows: Series A --1.55%, Series B--1.625% and
Series    C--1.05%.

(e) Federal income taxes: It is the policy of the fund to continue to qualify as
a regulated  investment company,  which can distribute tax exempt dividends,  by
complying with the applicable provisions of the

Internal  Revenue  Code  of 1986 as amended, and to make distributions of income
and  net  realized  capital gain sufficient to relieve it from substantially all
federal income and excise taxes.

The  fund  has  an  unused  capital  loss carryover of approximately $28,514,620
available  for  federal  income  tax  purposes  to be applied against future net
securities  profits,  if  any,  realized subsequent to November 30, 2002. If not
applied,  $9,312,230 of the carryover expires in fiscal 2003, $3,964,163 expires
in  fiscal  2007,  $5,542,712 expires in fiscal 2008, $442,201 expires in fiscal
2009 and $9,253,314 expires in fiscal 2010.

The  tax  character of distributions paid to shareholders during the fiscal year
ended  November  30, 2002 was as follows: tax exempt income $30,331,952. The tax
character  of  current  year  distributions will be determined at the end of the
current fiscal year.

NOTE 2--Bank Line of Credit:

The  fund  participates  with  other  Dreyfus-managed  funds  in  a $100 million
unsecured  line  of  credit  primarily to be utilized for temporary or emergency
purposes.  Interest  is  charged to the fund based on prevailing market rates in
effect at the time of borrowings. During the period ended May 31, 2003, the fund
did not borrow under the line of credit.

NOTE 3--Investment Advisory Fee, Administration Fee and Other Transactions With
Affiliates:

(a)  The  fee  payable  by the fund, pursuant to the provisions of an Investment
Advisory  Agreement  with Dreyfus, is payable monthly based on an annual rate of
.. 50  of  1% of the value of the fund's average weekly net assets. The fund also
has  an  Administration  Agreement  with  Dreyfus,  a Custody Agreement with the
Custodian and a Transfer Agency and Registrar Agreement with PFPC. The fund pays
in  the  aggregate  for  administration,  custody and transfer agency services a
monthly  fee  based on an annual rate of .25 of 1% of the value of the
                                                                        The Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (CONTINUED)

fund' s  average  weekly  net  assets; out-of pocket transfer agency and custody
expenses are paid separately by the fund.

(b)  Through January 27th, 2003, each director who is not an "affiliated person"
as  defined  in  the  Act  received from the fund an annual fee of $4,500 and an
attendance  fee  of  $500 per meeting. Each such director also serves as a board
member  of  other  Funds  within  the  Dreyfus  complex (collectively, the "Fund
Group" ). After  January 27th, 2003, Board compensation was changed from a "Fund
by  Fund"  basis  to  a  "Fund  Group"  basis,  such that each such director now
receives  an  annual  fee  of  $30,000,  an  attendance  fee  of $4,000 for each
in-person  meeting  and  $500  for  telephone meetings. These fees are allocated
among  the  funds  in  the  Fund Group in proportion to each fund's relative net
assets.   The  Chairman  of  the  Board  receives  an  additional  25%  of  such
compensation.  Subject to the fund's Emeritus Program Guidelines, Emeritus Board
members, if any, receive 50% of the annual retainer fee and per meeting fee paid
at the time the Board member achieves emeritus status.

NOTE 4--Securities Transactions:

The  aggregate amount of purchases and sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term  securities,  during  the  period  ended  May  31,  2003, amounted to
$210,612,156 and $206,010,437, respectively.

At  May  31,  2003,  accumulated  net unrealized appreciation on investments was
$20,627,375,   consisting  of  $43,601,261  gross  unrealized  appreciation  and
$22,973,886 gross unrealized depreciation.

At  May  31,  2003,  the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes was
substantially  the  same  as  the cost for financial reporting purposes (see the
Statement of Investments).
