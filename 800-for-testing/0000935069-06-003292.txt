(a)  The  aggregate  cost  of  investments  for tax  purposes  is  approximately
$138,993,900.  Net unrealized  appreciation  on investments  for tax purposes is
$24,018,127,  consisting of $24,184,688  of gross  unrealized  appreciation  and
$166,561 of estimated gross unrealized depreciation.

(b) The investments are fair valued by Banc of America Investment Advisors, Inc.
(the "Adviser") or Grosvenor  Capital  Management,  L.P. (the  "Subadviser")  in
accordance  with  policies and  procedures  that seek to ensure that the Fund is
able to reliably  determine the value of its investments in the Portfolio Funds.
Investments  in Portfolio  Funds are generally valued at net asset value,  which
approximates  fair  value,  as  reported  by the  administrators  or  investment
managers of the  Portfolio  Funds.  Such values  generally  represent the Fund's
proportionate share of the net assets of the Portfolio Funds.  Accordingly,  the
value of  investments  in Portfolio  Funds is generally  increased by additional
contributions  to the Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from
the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by  withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net
losses of the Portfolio Funds.

The Portfolio Funds' administrators or investment managers generally value their
investments at fair value. Listed investment  securities are generally valued by
an independent pricing source. Securities with no readily available market value
are  initially  valued at cost,  with  subsequent  adjustments  to values  which
reflect either the basis of meaningful  third-party  transactions in the private
market, or fair value deemed appropriate by Portfolio Funds' management. In such
instances,  consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating
results of the issuer, the amount that the Portfolio Funds can reasonably expect
to realize upon sale of the securities and other factors deemed relevant.

The below ratios are  calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses
as  applicable by the average of total monthly  members'  capital.  Total return
amounts are calculated by  geometrically  linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.

strategies  and (ii)  are  expected  to  exhibit  a low  degree  of  performance
correlation,  not only with broad market indices but also with each other. These
Portfolio  Funds  are  managed  by  selected  investment  managers  ("Investment
Managers") who specialize in the chosen  strategies.  The Fund generally invests
in between 25 and 50 Portfolio Funds.

Effective  December  4,  2004,  Banc  of  America  Investment   Advisors,   Inc.
("Adviser") is the SEC registered investment adviser to the Fund. The Adviser is
an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of Bank of America  Corporation  ("BAC").
Prior to December 4, 2004, Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("CMA"), which has
merged into Columbia Management Advisors, LLC, was the investment adviser to the
Fund.  CMA is an affiliate of the  Adviser.  The Adviser has retained  Grosvenor
Capital Management,  L.P. ("Grosvenor" or the "Subadviser") as subadviser to the
Fund. The Adviser and the  Subadviser  have been  designated as special  members
(the "Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The  Fund's  investments  are  fair  valued  by the  Adviser  or  Subadviser  in
accordance  with  policies and  procedures  that seek to ensure that the Fund is
able to reliably  determine the value of its investments in the Portfolio Funds.
Investments in Portfolio  Funds are generally  valued at net asset value,  which
approximates  fair  value,  as  reported  by the  administrators  or  investment
managers of the  Portfolio  Funds.  Such values  generally  represent the Fund's
proportionate share of the net assets of the Portfolio Funds.  Accordingly,  the
value of  investments  in Portfolio  Funds is generally  increased by additional
contributions  to the Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from
the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by  withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net
losses from the Portfolio Funds.

The Portfolio Funds' administrators or investment managers generally value their
investments at fair value. Listed investment  securities are generally valued by
an  independent  pricing  source.  Futures are valued on the basis of  available
market  quotations.  Securities  with no  readily  available  market  value  are
initially valued at cost, with subsequent  adjustments to values,  which reflect
either the basis of meaningful  third-party  transactions in the private market,
or fair  value  deemed  appropriate  by  Portfolio  Funds'  management.  In such
instances,  consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating
results of the issuer, the amount that the Portfolio Funds can reasonably expect
to realize upon sale of the securities and other factors deemed relevant.

C.   INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest  income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the average cost basis.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D.   INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax return  their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

E.   CASH

At September 30, 2006, a total of $2,887,970 in cash was held on deposit at PFPC
Trust Company,  the Fund's custodian.  Of that amount,  $1,709,971 was held in a
segregated  account at PFPC Trust  Company  related to holdbacks on  withdrawals
from investors in the Fund.

F.   FUTURES CONTRACTS

The Fund utilized futures  contracts during the period ended September 30, 2006.
The Fund's use of futures is primarily for tactical  hedging  purposes.  Initial
margin  deposits of cash and  securities  are made upon  entering  into  futures
contracts.  The contracts are marked to market monthly and the resulting changes
in value are  accounted  for as unrealized  gains and losses.  Variation  margin
payments are paid or received, depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses
are incurred.  When the contract is closed,  the Fund records a realized gain or
loss equal to the difference  between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing
transaction and the amount invested in the contract.

Risks of entering into futures contracts include the possibility that there will
be an  imperfect  price  correlation  between  the  futures  and the  underlying
securities.  Second,  it is  possible  that  a lack  of  liquidity  for  futures
contracts  could exist in the  secondary  market,  resulting  in an inability to
close a  position  prior to its  maturity  date.  Third,  the  futures  contract
involves  risk that the Fund could lose more than the  original  margin  deposit
required to initiate a futures transaction. Finally, the risk exists that losses
could exceed  amounts  disclosed on the schedule of  investments or statement of
assets and liabilities.

3.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).


                                       12

               Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period,  before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions  thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital  contributions  made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

The Board, from time to time and in their complete and exclusive discretion, may
determine to repurchase interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  interests  from Members at June 30,
2006.  The  interests  redeemed  pursuant  to  such  tenders  are  shown  in the
Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject any application for interest in the Fund.

4.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to two years  from  initial  investment.  Some  Portfolio  Funds  may  charge
redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing  market  conditions.  None of the  Portfolio  Funds is expected to make
distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

For the six months ended  September 30, 2006,  aggregate  purchases and sales of
portfolio  funds  amounted to  $8,900,000,  and  $21,253,820,  respectively.  In
addition,  the Fund paid  $2,900,000  for purchases in advance of Portfolio Fund
openings.

               Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

5.   MANAGEMENT FEE

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a portion of the management
fee that it receives  from the Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

6.   INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for
such  Incentive  Period  over (b) the  greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the  balance  in the  Member's  Loss
Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

A Member's "Loss  Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period is zero and for
each Incentive Period  thereafter is equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward as
of  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased  or
decreased,  but not below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between
the net  losses  over  net  profits  allocated  to the  Member  for the  current
Incentive Period.  The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive
if  its  Interest  as of  the  beginning  of  that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted
appropriately for any additional contributions) earned a rate of return equal to
the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar
quarter  and reset on the first day of each  calendar  quarter.  The Hurdle Rate
Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive  Period.  The Hurdle
Rate  Amounts  for March 31,  2006,  June 30, 2006 and  September  30, 2006 were
4.424% ,  4.904%,  and  5.312% per annum,  respectively.  On June 30,  2006,  an
incentive  allocation  of $45,642 was realized.  Additional  capital of $466,087
would have been reallocable to the Special Members had the Members'  measurement
period for incentive allocation closed on September 30, 2006.

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety. Allocations to the Investor and capital contributions

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

6.   INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

made by the Member  during the  Incentive  Period  prior to such  repurchase  or
distribution,  and  the  Member's  opening  capital  account  balance  and  Loss
Carryforward  as of the beginning of such  Incentive  Period,  will be allocated
between the two Interests in proportion to the portion of the Member's  Interest
that is repurchased or distributed.

7.   ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION FEES

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC")  (also an affiliate  of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)
serves as  administrator  and accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity
provides certain accounting,  record keeping, and investor related services. The
Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian and the  administrator  based primarily
upon month-end  Members'  capital,  subject to a monthly minimum fee.  Effective
January 1, 2005,  the Fund has entered  into an  agreement  with PFPC to perform
regulatory administrative services. The Fund pays PFPC .015% per year of average
net assets  subject to a minimum  fee. For the six months  ended  September  30,
2006,  the Fund  expensed  $15,000,  which is recorded in Other  expenses in the
accompanying Statement of Operations.

8.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Each manager who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund,  as defined by the
1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $6,000 plus a fee of $1,000 for each
meeting attended.  Any manager or officer who is an "interested person" does not
receive any annual fee or other fees from the Fund.  All managers are reimbursed
by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Effective April 1, 2005, the Adviser provides a Chief Compliance  Officer to the
Fund at no cost to the Fund.

Investors  who  repurchased  their  capital  interest from the Fund prior to the
December  31, 2005  tender  period  were not paid  interest on their  contingent
payment as stated on the tender offer  documents.  As a result,  these investors
are due interest from the Fund in the amount of $12,070  representing the unpaid
interest  amount due to investors  from the date of the original  tender payment
through June 30, 2006. The Adviser will  reimburse the Fund for unpaid  interest
paid to  investors.  The total  amount of  reimbursement  is  $12,070,  which is
included as Receivable  from Adviser and in Capital  withdrawals  payable on the
Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

9.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT
     RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
only  invested  in  such  limited  partnership  and  limited  liability  company
interests.

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Members and will not be  exchangeable  for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer  from  time to time to  repurchase  Interests  at their  members'  capital
account value, the Interests are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined  by the Board in its  discretion  and such  repurchase
amount may represent only a small portion of the Fund's  outstanding  Interests.
Because the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds  themselves  have  limited
liquidity,  the Fund may not be able to fund  significant  repurchases.  Members
whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase  also bear the risk that the Fund's
members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they submit
their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be minimal.

10.  LITIGATION EVENT

The  events  described  below  have not  directly  impacted  the Fund or had any
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

On February 9, 2005,  certain  affiliates  of the Adviser,  including the former
investment adviser to the Fund,  entered into Assurances of Discontinuance  with
the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlements") and consented to
the entry of  cease-and-desist  orders by the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") (the "SEC  Orders") in connection  with matters  related to late trading
and market timing of mutual funds advised and  distributed  by affiliates of the
Adviser. The SEC Orders and the NYAG Settlements contain  substantially the same
terms and conditions  outlined in the agreements in principle that affiliates of
the Adviser  entered into with the SEC and NYAG in March 2004. A copy of the SEC
Orders is available on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov. A copy of the NYAG
settlements  is  available as part of the Bank of America  Corporation  Form 8-K
filing of February 10, 2005.

In  connection  with these  matters,  various  parties  have filed suit  against
certain  Columbia Funds  (including  former Nations Funds),  the Trustees of the
Columbia  Funds,  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  (the former parent of the
Adviser)  and  certain  of  its  affiliated  entities  and/or  Bank  of  America
Corporation  and  certain  of its  affiliated  entities.  More  than 300  cases,
including  those filed against  entities  unaffiliated  with the Columbia Funds,
their Boards,  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  and its affiliated  entities
and/or  Bank of  America  Corporation  and its  affiliated  entities,  have been
transferred  to a  multi-district  proceeding in the Federal  District  Court in
Maryland.  The parties have reached settlements or settlements in principle with
respect to the claims in the proceeding  concerning the Columbia Funds. All such
settlements  are  subject  to court  approval.  Other  actions  against  certain
Columbia  Funds,  the Trustees of the Columbia  Funds,  advisers and  affiliated
entities,  alleging among other things excessive fees and  inappropriate  use of
fund assets for distribution and other improper purposes, have been consolidated
in the  Massachusetts  federal  court as IN RE COLUMBIA  ENTITIES  LITIGATION on
March 2,  2005.  On  November  30,  2005,  the  judge  dismissed  all  claims by
plaintiffs and ordered that the case be closed. The plaintiffs filed a notice of
appeal to the United  States Court of Appeals for the First  Circuit on December
30,  2005;  this  appeal is  currently  pending.  The parties  have  advised the
appellate  court that they are engaged in settlement  discussions  and the court
has, accordingly,  deferred the briefing schedule for the appeal. The settlement
has not yet been finalized. Any settlement ultimately agreed by the parties will
be subject to court approval. These actions are ongoing.

11.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")  issued FASB
interpretation 48 ("FIN 48"), "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes". This
standard  defines the  threshold  for  recognizing  the  benefits of  tax-return
positions in the financial statements as  "more-likely-than-not" to be sustained
by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

11.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED)

position  meeting  the  more-likely-than-  not  criterion,  based on the largest
benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized.  FIN 48 is effective
as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning  after December 15, 2006.
At adoption,  companies must adjust their  financial  statements to reflect only
those tax  positions  that are  more-likely-than-  not to be sustained as of the
adoption  date. As of September 30, 2006, the Fund does not expect the impact of
the adoption of FIN 48 will be material to the financial statements.

In September  2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)  issued
STATEMENT  ON  FINANCIAL  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS  (SFAS)  NO.  157,  "FAIR  VALUE
MEASUREMENTS." This standard  establishes a single  authoritative  definition of
fair  value,  sets  out a  framework  for  measuring  fair  value  and  requires
additional  disclosures about fair value  measurements.  SFAS No. 157 applies to
fair value  measurements  already  required or permitted by existing  standards.
SFAS No. 157 is  effective  for  financial  statements  issued for fiscal  years
beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years.
The  changes  to  current  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  from the
application  of this  Statement  relate to the  definition  of fair  value,  the
methods used to measure  fair value,  and the  expanded  disclosures  about fair
value  measurements.  As of September  30,  2006,  the Fund does not believe the
adoption  of SFAS No. 157 will  impact the  amounts  reported  in the  financial
statements,  however,  additional  disclosures  may be required about the inputs
used to develop the  measurements  and the effect of certain of the measurements
reported on the Statement of Changes in Investors' Capital for a fiscal period.

12.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Subsequent  to  September  30,  2006,  the  Fund  received   additional  capital
contributions of $1,765,891.



The Fund files its complete  schedule of portfolio  holdings with the Securities
and Exchange  Commission for the first and third quarters of each fiscal year on
Form N-Q within  sixty days after the end of the period.  The Fund's Form N-Q is
available on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov, and may be reviewed
and  copied  at the  Commission's  Public  Reference  Room in  Washington,  D.C.
Information  on the  operation of the Public  Reference  Room may be obtained by
calling 1-800-SEC-0330.

               Investment Contract Renewal Disclosure (unaudited)


BOARD ACTION WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND SUBADVISORY AGREEMENTS

At a meeting held on September 20, 2006,  the Board of Directors of the Columbia
Management  Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund"),  which consists only of
Directors  who are not  "interested  persons"  of the  Fund (as  defined  in the
Investment  Company  Act of  1940),  approved  the  continuation  of the  Fund's
management   agreement  (the  "Management   Agreement")  with  Banc  of  America
Investment   Advisors,   Inc.  ("BAIA")  and  the  subadvisory   agreement  (the
"Subadvisory  Agreement"  and,  together  with  the  Management  Agreement,  the
"Advisory Agreements") with Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Grosvenor") for
an additional  one year period ending on October 31, 2007. At that meeting,  the
Board  considered  information and factors that it believed were relevant to the
interests of the Fund's investors,  and during its deliberations  consulted with
its independent legal counsel and with Fund counsel. In addition, at most of its
other meetings  throughout the year, the Board considers  matters bearing on the
Advisory Agreements.

The Directors  receive and review all materials that they or their legal counsel
believe to be  reasonably  necessary  to evaluate the  Advisory  Agreements  and
determine whether to approve their continuation. Those materials included, among
other items, (i) information on the Fund's  investment  performance  relative to
the  performance  of a universe of registered  funds of hedge funds  compiled by
BAIA,  including  funds  managed by third  parties and another  registered  fund
managed by BAIA (the  "BAIA-Identified  Peer  Group"),  as well as  unregistered
funds of hedge funds managed by BAIA ("BAIA Unregistered Funds"), and the Fund's
performance  benchmark;  (ii)  information on the Fund's advisory fees and other
expenses,  including  information  comparing the Fund's expenses to those of the
BAIA-Identified  Peer  Group and the BAIA  Unregistered  Funds  and  information
compiled by an independent  third party  comparing the Fund's expenses to a peer
group of  registered  funds of hedge  funds  identified  by the third party (the
"Third  Party-Identified  Peer Group" and together with the BAIA-Identified Peer
Group,  the "Peer Groups");  (iii)  information  about the  profitability of the
Management Agreement to BAIA and potential "fall-out" or ancillary benefits that
BAIA and its affiliates may receive as a result of their  relationships with the
Fund; and (iv) information obtained through BAIA's and Grosvenor's response to a
letter  prepared at the request of the  Directors  by their  counsel  requesting
certain  information  in  connection  with the  renewal of the  Fund's  Advisory
Agreements.  The Board  also  considered  other  information  such as (v) BAIA's
financial  results  and BAIA's and  Grosvenor's  financial  condition,  and (vi)
BAIA's and Grosvenor's  resources devoted to, and its record of compliance with,
the Fund's investment policies and restrictions, policies on personal securities
transactions  and  other  compliance  policies.   Throughout  the  process,  the
Directors  had the  opportunity  to ask  questions  of, and  request  additional
materials from, BAIA and Grosvenor and to consult with their legal counsel.  The
Board also referred to information about the Fund's  investment  process that it
received  from  Grosvenor's   investment   professionals  at  previous  meetings
throughout the year.

In considering whether to approve the continuation of the Advisory Agreements,
the Directors did not identify any single factor as determinative, and each
weighed various factors as he deemed appropriate. The Directors considered the
following matters in connection with their approval of the continuation of the
Advisory Agreements:

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. The Board considered the
nature, quality and extent of the advisory services provided by BAIA and
Grosvenor under the Advisory Agreements. It considered the investment approach
Grosvenor employs, Grosvenor's research capabilities, the nature of BAIA's and
Grosvenor's experience and resources, the experience of relevant Grosvenor and
BAIA personnel, and Grosvenor's and BAIA's resources, practices and procedures
designed to address regulatory compliance matters.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board reviewed the Fund's investment performance and
the performance of the funds in the BAIA-Identified Peer Group and the BAIA
Unregistered Funds. The Board also reviewed the factors that Grosvenor
identified as contributing to performance.

EXPENSE INFORMATION, PROFITABILITY AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board gave
substantial consideration to the fees payable under the Fund's Advisory
Agreements and to the fact that BAIA pays Grosvenor's subadvisory fees out of
the advisory fees that BAIA receives from the Fund. The Board also considered
the incentive allocation payable to Grosvenor and BAIA. The Board reviewed the
Fund's fees and expenses and the fees and expenses of other comparable
registered funds of hedge funds, including funds in the Peer Groups and the BAIA
Unregistered Funds. The Board also considered information regarding the advisory
fees paid by a similar registered fund of hedge funds managed by BAIA that was
included in the Peer Groups. The Board noted BAIA's stated justification for the
fees charged to the Fund, which included information about performance and
services.

The Board reviewed the actual dollar amount of fees paid to BAIA and Grosvenor
under the Advisory Agreements and BAIA's expenses in providing its services and,
in this context, considered the fact that BAIA or its affiliates provide other
services to the Fund and its investors and receive payment for these services.
The Board also considered so-called "fall-out benefits" to BAIA, such as any
incremental increase to its reputation derived from serving as investment
adviser to the Fund.

In addition, the Board considered possible economies of scale with respect to
the management of the Fund that might be realized at different Fund asset
levels. In this regard, the Board considered the Fund's existing and reasonably
foreseeable asset levels and information relating to BAIA's costs.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. The Board also considered the terms of the Advisory
Agreements, including the applicable standard of care, and the structure of, and
the method used to determine, the compensation of Grosvenor's portfolio
managers. In addition, the Board considered the extent to which the Fund
operated in accordance with its investment objective and its record of
compliance with its investment restrictions, and the compliance programs of the
Fund and BAIA.

Based on these considerations and following deliberation and discussion, in open
sessions with representatives of BAIA and Grosvenor and in executive sessions
with independent counsel, the Directors concluded that (i) BAIA and Grosvenor
had the capabilites, resources and personnel necessary to fulfill their duties
under the Advisory Agreements; (ii) the scope and quality of services provided
under the Advisory Agreement are consistent with the Fund's operational
requirements; (iii) the advisory fees paid to BAIA under the Management
Agreement as well as the incentive allocation payable to BAIA were reasonable in
light of the services that BAIA provides and the costs that BAIA incurs; (iv)
the subadvisory fees paid to Grosvenor under the Subadvisory Agreement as well
as the incentive allocation payable to Grosvenor were reasonable in light of the
services that Grosvenor provides; (v) BAIA's profitability in providing advisory
services to the Fund were reasonable; and (vi) there was no potential for
economies of scale to be realized by BAIA and Grosvenor in managing the Fund
given the current and foreseeable asset size of the Fund. Based on their
evaluation of all factors that they deemed to be material, including those
factors described above, and assisted by the advice of independent counsel, the
Directors approved the continuance of the Advisory Agreements.
