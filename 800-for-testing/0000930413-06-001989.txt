            Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Members and Board of Managers of
Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C.  (the "Company"),  including
the schedules of portfolio  investments and securities  sold, not yet purchased,
as of December 31, 2005,  and the related  statement of operations  for the year
then ended,  and the  statements of changes in members'  capital for each of the
two  years  in the  period  then  ended.  These  financial  statements  are  the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Company's  internal  control over financial  reporting.  Our audits
included  consideration of internal control over financial  reporting as a basis
for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but
not for the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the  effectiveness  of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no
such  opinion.  An audit also  includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence
supporting the amounts and  disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2005, by correspondence with
the  custodian  and other brokers or by other  appropriate  auditing  procedures
where replies from brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of Advantage  Advisers  Xanthus
Fund, L.L.C. at December 31,2005, and the results of its operations for the year
then ended, and the changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in
the period then ended, in conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.


                                                               /s/ Ernst & Young

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - DECEMBER 31, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      1. ORGANIZATION

         Advantage  Advisers Xanthus Fund,  L.L.C. (the "Company") was organized
         as a limited  liability  company  under the laws of Delaware in January
         1999.  The Company is registered  under the  Investment  Company Act of
         1940,  as  amended,  (the  "Act")  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified
         management  investment company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless
         the  Company is  otherwise  terminated  under the terms of the  Limited
         Liability  Company  Agreement  dated as of June 5, 2003.  The Company's
         investment  objective is to achieve  maximum capital  appreciation.  It
         pursues this objective by actively investing in a portfolio  consisting
         primarily of equity securities of technology companies and of companies
         which derive a major  portion of their  revenue  directly or indirectly
         from  technological  events and advances.  The  Company's  portfolio of
         securities in the technology area is expected to include long and short
         positions   primarily  in  equity   securities  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.
         companies.  Equity  securities  include common and preferred  stock and
         other securities having equity  characteristics,  including convertible
         debt securities, stock options, warrants and rights.

         Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of the
         operations of the Company is vested in the individuals who serve as the
         Board of Managers of the Company  ("Board of Managers").  There are six
         members  of the  Board  of  Managers,  one of  whom  is  considered  an
         "interested person" under the Act. The Company's  investment adviser is
         Advantage  Advisers  Management,  L.L.C., a Delaware limited  liability
         company (the  "Adviser").  The Adviser is a subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer
         Asset  Management  Inc.  ("OAM") and an affiliate of  Oppenheimer & Co.
         Inc.  ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is  responsible  for  managing  the
         Company's  investment  activities  pursuant to an  investment  advisory
         agreement  dated  June  5,  2003.  OAM is the  managing  member  of the
         Adviser,   and  Alkeon  Capital  Management  L.L.C.   ("Alkeon")  is  a
         non-managing member of the Adviser.  Investment  professionals employed
         by Alkeon,  including Mr. Takis Sparaggis,  who serves as the Company's
         portfolio  manager,  manage the  Company's  portfolio  on behalf of the
         Adviser under the supervision of OAM. Oppenheimer has a minority profit
         participation interest in Alkeon.

         The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members is
         subject to approval by the Board of  Managers.  From January 1, 2004 to
         December  31, 2004,  new Members  were not  accepted  into the Company,
         although  existing Members as of December 31, 2003 were allowed to make
         additional  contributions.  At a meeting held on November 1, 2004,  the
         Board of Managers  approved the acceptance of initial  contributions by
         the Company from new members on or after  January 1, 2005.  The Company
         may from time to time offer to repurchase interests pursuant to written
         tenders by Members.  Such repurchases will be made at such times and on
         such  terms as may be  determined  by the Board of  Managers,  in their
         complete and exclusive  discretion.  The Adviser expects that generally
         it will  recommend to the Board of Managers  that the Company  offer to
         repurchase interests from Members twice each year, effective at the end
         of the second fiscal quarter and again at the end of the year.

         Generally,  except as provided under applicable law, a Member shall not
         be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities in any
         amount in excess of the capital  account  balance of such Member,  plus
         such Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Adviser to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Adviser believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's financial  statements
         are reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from
         these estimates.

         A. REVENUE RECOGNITION

         Securities  transactions,  including related revenue and expenses,  are
         recorded on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
         ex-dividend date, net of applicable  withholding taxes. Interest income
         and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and discounts
         on fixed income  securities are amortized using the effective  interest
         rate method.

         B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         The Company's securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted
         by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

         (i) Domestic  exchange traded  securities (other than options and those
             securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

             (1) at  their  last  composite  sale  prices  as  reported  on  the
                 exchanges where those securities are traded; or

             (2) If no sales of those  securities  are  reported on a particular
                 day, the securities  are valued based upon their  composite bid
                 prices for  securities  held  long,  or their  composite  asked
                 prices for securities  sold, not yet purchased,  as reported by
                 those exchanges.

         (ii)Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

             (1) at the NASDAQ  Official  Closing Price  ("NOCP")  (which is the
                 last trade price at or before 4:00 PM (Eastern  Time)  adjusted
                 up to NASDAQ's  best offer  price if the last  traded  price is
                 below such bid and down to  NASDAQ's  best  offer  price if the
                 last trade is above such offer price); or

             (2) if no NOCP is  available,  at the last sale price on the NASDAQ
                 prior to the calculation of the net asset value of the Company;
                 or

      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

             (3) if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

             (4) if no sale is shown  and no bid price is  available,  the price
                 will be deemed  "stale"  and the value  will be  determined  in
                 accordance with the fair valuation procedures set forth herein.

         Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange will be valued at
         their  last sale  prices on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are
         primarily  traded, or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular
         day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities held long) or asked
         prices (in the case of securities  sold, not yet purchased) as reported
         by such exchange. Listed options will be valued at their bid prices (or
         asked prices in the case of listed written  options) as reported by the
         exchange with the highest  volume on the last day a trade was reported.
         Other securities for which market quotations are readily available will
         be  valued  at  their  bid  prices  (or  asked  prices  in the  case of
         securities  sold,  not yet  purchased)  as  obtained  from  one or more
         dealers making markets for those  securities.  If market quotations are
         not readily  available,  securities  and other assets will be valued at
         fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the supervision of,
         the Board of Managers.

         Debt  securities  will be  valued  in  accordance  with the  procedures
         described above,  which with respect to such securities may include the
         use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a matrix
         to determine  valuation for normal  institutional size trading units or
         consultation with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
         Managers will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
         provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities with remaining
         maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual  circumstances,  be
         valued at amortized  cost,  so long as such  valuation is determined by
         the Board of Managers to represent fair value.

         All assets and liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
         will be  converted  into U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
         provided by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m.  London  time.
         Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values of
         such  securities  are  determined,  prior to the  close  of  securities
         markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior to
         such close.  On occasion,  the values of such  securities  and exchange
         rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time such values
         or exchange  rates are determined and the time that the net asset value
         of the Company is determined.  When such events  materially  affect the
         values of  securities  held by the  Company  or its  liabilities,  such
         securities and  liabilities  will be valued at fair value as determined
         in good faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         B. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         Fair value shall take into account the relevant factors and surrounding
         circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the nature and pricing  history
         (if any) of the security or other  investment;  (ii) whether any dealer
         quotations are available;  (iii) possible valuation  methodologies that
         could be used to determine fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation of the
         Adviser with respect to the valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar
         securities  or other  investments  are held by other  accounts or other
         funds  managed by the  Adviser  and the  valuation  method  used by the
         Adviser with respect  thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair value
         to be determined will result from the use of data or formulae  produced
         by third parties independent of the Adviser; and (vii) the liquidity or
         illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

         The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify as
         financial instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
         No.  107,  "Discloses  about  Fair  Value  of  Financial  Instruments,"
         approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement  ofAssets,
         Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         C. CASH EQUIVALENTS

         The Company treats all highly liquid financial  instruments that mature
         within  three  months at the time of purchase as cash  equivalents.  At
         December 31, 2005, $704,827 in cash equivalents was held at PNC Bank.

         D. INCOME TAXES

         No provision for the payment of Federal, state or local income taxes on
         the  profits of the  Company is made as the  Members  are  individually
         liable for the income taxes on their share of the Company's income.

         The  Company  has   reclassified   ($3,399,281)  and  $47,304,902  from
         accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated net realized gain on
         investments, respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
         ended  December  31,  2005.  This  reclassification  was  a  result  of
         permanent book to tax  differences to reflect,  as an adjustment to net
         capital  contributions,  the amounts of taxable  loss and net  realized
         gain on investments  that have been allocated to the Company's  Members
         and had no effect on net assets.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

         Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services to the Company
         including, among other things, providing office space and other support
         services. In exchange for such services, the Company pays Oppenheimer a
         monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized basis) of
         the Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

      3. ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

         During the year ended December 31, 2005, Oppenheimer earned $221,800 as
         brokerage commissions from portfolio transactions executed on behalf of
         the Company.  Mainsail  Group,  L.L.C.,  a  broker-dealer  affiliate of
         Alkeon,  earned  $1,054,243  as brokerage  commissions  from  portfolio
         transactions executed on behalf of the Company.

         Net profits or net losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
         allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts
         of all Members (but not the Special Advisory Member) as of the last day
         of each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective investment
         percentages for the fiscal period. The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
         Special  Advisory  Member of the  Company,  is  entitled  to receive an
         incentive  allocation  (the  "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged  to the
         capital  account of each  Member as of the last day of each  allocation
         period,  of 20% of the amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the
         positive balance in the Member's "loss recovery account." The Incentive
         Allocation is credited to the Special  Advisory Account of the Adviser.
         By the last  business day of the month  following  the date on which an
         Incentive  Allocation  is made,  the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of
         the  Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited to the Special  Advisory
         Account with respect to the  allocation  period.  During the year ended
         December 31, 2005, an Incentive  Allocation of $3,335,825  was credited
         to the Special Advisory Member's capital account.

         Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not an
         "interested  person" of the Company, as defined by the Act, receives an
         annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  Any
         Manager who is an  "interested  person"  does not receive any annual or
         other fee from the Company.  Managers who are not "interested  persons"
         are reimbursed by the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
         incurred by them in performing their duties.

         PFPC  Trust  Company  (the  "Custodian")  serves  as  custodian  of the
         Company's assets.

         PFPC Inc.  ("PFPC") serves as investor services and accounting agent to
         the  Company  and  in  that  capacity   provides  certain   accounting,
         recordkeeping and investor related  services.  The Company pays PFPC an
         accounting and investor services fee based primarily on the average net
         assets  of the  Company  as of the  last  day of  each  month,  payable
         monthly, subject to a minimum annual fee.

         Oppenheimer acts as the non-exclusive  placement agent for the Company,
         without  special   compensation  from  the  Company,  and  bears  costs
         associated  with  its  activities  as  placement  agent.  However,  the
         placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission  of up to 3%
         (up to 3.1% of the amount  invested) in  connection  with a purchase of
         interests,  at its  discretion.  For the year ended  December 31, 2005,
         such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $23,650.

      4. INDEMNIFICATIONS

         The Company has entered into  several  contracts  that contain  routine
         indemnification  clauses.  The Company's  maximum  exposure under these
         arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve future claims that may
         be made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However, based
         on experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

      5. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  investment  securities,  excluding
         short-term  securities,  for the year ended December 31, 2005, amounted
         to $1,619,963,725 and $1,742,832,458, respectively. Aggregate purchases
         and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased,  excluding  short-term
         securities,   for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2005,  amounted  to
         $733,503,939 and $720,202,262, respectively.

         At  December  31,  2005,  the  aggregate  cost for  Federal  income tax
         purposes  of  portfolio   investments  and  securities  sold,  not  yet
         purchased was $375,525,790, and $106,579,426, respectively.

         For Federal income tax purposes, at December 31, 2005,  accumulated net
         unrealized  depreciation on portfolio  investments and securities sold,
         not yet  purchased was  $2,928,116,  consisting  of  $16,343,541  gross
         unrealized appreciation and $19,271,657 gross unrealized depreciation.

         Due from broker primarily represents proceeds from securities sold, not
         yet  purchased,  net of excess  cash,  held at the  prime  broker as of
         December 31, 2005.

      6. SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

         The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that connection,
         borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Trading in
         equity  securities  on margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
         representing  at least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
         respect to transactions in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
         respect  to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act  requires  the
         Company  to  satisfy  an  asset  coverage  requirement  of  300% of its
         indebtedness,  including  amounts  borrowed,  measured  at the time the
         Company  incurs  the   indebtedness.   The  Company  pays  interest  on
         outstanding  margin  borrowings  at an  annualized  rate of LIBOR  plus
         0.875%.  The Company  pledges  securities as collateral  for the margin
         borrowings,  which are  maintained in a segregated  account held by the
         Custodian.  As of and for the year ended December 31, 2005, the Company
         had no outstanding margin borrowings.

      7. FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
         CREDIT RISK

         In the  normal  course of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
         financial instruments and enter into various investment activities with
         off-balance sheet risk. These financial instruments include options and
         securities  sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,   these  financial
         instruments  represent  future  commitments  to  purchase or sell other
         financial instruments at specific terms at specified future dates. Each
         of these financial  instruments contains varying degrees of off-balance
         sheet  risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value of the  securities
         underlying  the financial  instruments  may be in excess of the amounts
         recognized  in  the  statement  of  assets,  liabilities  and  members'
         capital.

         The Company  maintains cash in bank deposit  accounts  which, at times,
         may exceed  federally  insured limits.  The Company has not experienced
         any losses in such  accounts  and does not believe it is exposed to any
         significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

         Securities sold, not yet purchased represent obligations of the Company
         to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a liability  to
         purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at  prevailing   prices.
         Accordingly, these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
         Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities sold,
         not yet purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
         assets, liabilities and members' capital.

         The risk  associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays
         a premium  whether or not the option is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
         Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and change in market  value
         should the  counterparty  not perform under the contract.  Put and call
         options  purchased  are  accounted for in the same manner as investment
         securities.

         When the Company writes an option,  the premium received by the Company
         is recorded as a liability and is subsequently  adjusted to the current
         market value of the option written. If a call option is exercised,  the
         premium  is added  to the  proceeds  from  the  sale of the  underlying
         security in  determining  whether  the  Company has  realized a gain or
         loss.  In writing an option,  the  Company  bears the market risk of an
         unfavorable change in the price of the security or index underlying the
         written  option.  Exercise of an option  written by the  Company  could
         result in the Company selling or buying a security at a price different
         from the current market value. During the year ended December 31, 2005,
         transactions in written options were as follows:

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.


                         ALKEON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                             As of February 27, 2006
I.   POLICY

     Proxy voting is an important right of shareholders  and reasonable care and
diligence  must be undertaken to ensure that such rights are properly and timely
exercised. When Alkeon Capital Management, LLC ("Alkeon") has discretion to vote
the proxies of its clients,  it will vote those  proxies in the best interest of
its clients and in accordance with these policies and procedures.

II. PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES

     (a) All proxies  received  by Alkeon  will be sent to  Alkeon"s  Compliance
Officer, currently Greg Jakubowsky. The Compliance Officer will:

          (1) Keep a record of each proxy received;

          (2)  Determine  if there  are any  routine  proposals  and  vote  them
accordingly  (see  Section  III).  If  there  are  non-routine  proposals,   the
Compliance  Officer  will then  forward  the proxy to the  Portfolio  Manager or
Analyst responsible for that given security;

          (3) Determine  which  accounts  managed by Alkeon hold the security to
which the proxy relates;

          (4) Provide the  Portfolio  Manager or Analyst  with the date by which
Alkeon must vote the proxy in order to allow enough time for the completed proxy
to be submitted to the issuer prior to the vote taking place.

          (5) Absent material  conflicts (see Section IV), the Portfolio Manager
or Analyst  will  determine  how Alkeon  should  vote the proxy.  The  Portfolio
Manager or Analyst will send his or her decision on how Alkeon will vote a proxy
to the Compliance Officer.  The Compliance Officer is responsible for completing
the proxy and entering the vote  information  in the ADP  ProxyEdge  system,  or
mailing the proxy in a timely manner if ADP ProxyEdge is not available.

III. VOTING GUIDELINES

     In the absence of specific voting  guidelines from the client,  Alkeon will
vote proxies in the best interests of each particular  client,  which may result
in different voting


<PAGE>

results for proxies for the same issuer.  Alkeon believes that voting proxies in
accordance with the following guidelines is in the best interest of its clients.

     o    Generally, Alkeon will vote in favor of routine corporate housekeeping
          proposals,   including  election  of  directors  (where  no  corporate
          governance issues are implicated) and selection of auditors.

     o    Generally,  Alkeon  will  vote  against  proposals  that  make it more
          difficult  to replace  members  of the  issuer's  board of  directors,
          including  proposals to stagger the board, cause management to be over
          represented  on the  board,  introduce  cumulative  voting,  introduce
          unequal voting rights, and create supermajority voting.

     o    Alkeon  has  determined  that  in most  cases  it  will  vote  for the
          expensing of stock  options as the  consensus  feeling is that options
          are an  actual  expense  of a given  issuer  unless  in  extraordinary
          circumstances approved by the Compliance Officer.

     For other  proposals,  Alkeon shall determine  whether a proposal is in the
best  interests of its clients and may take into account the following  factors,
among others:

     (1) whether the proposal was recommended by management and Alkeon's opinion
of management;

     (2) whether the proposal acts to entrench existing management; and

     (3) whether the proposal fairly compensates  management for past and future
performance.

IV.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     (1) The  Compliance  Officer will identify any conflicts that exist between
the interest of Alkeon and its clients.  This  examination will include a review
of the  relationship  of  Alkeon  and its  affiliates  with the  issuer  of each
security  and any of the issuer's  affiliates  to determine if the issuer or its
management  is a client of Alkeon or an  affiliate  of Alkeon or has some  other
relationship  with Alkeon or a client of Alkeon.  Examples of conflicts would be
voting  on any  security  of  Oppenheimer  & Co Inc.,  as Alkeon  manages  funds
sponsored by the entity.

     (2) If a material  conflict exists,  the Compliance  Officer will determine
whether voting in accordance  with the voting  guidelines and factors  described
above is in the best interest of the client.  The Compliance Officer will ensure
that all  proposals  are voted in the best  interest of the client by having all
material  conflicts  reviewed  by a proxy  voting  committee  consisting  of the
Compliance Officer and two Portfolio Managers.


<PAGE>

V.   DISCLOSURE

     (a) Alkeon will  disclose in its Form ADV Part II that  clients may contact
the Compliance Officer via e-mail at  gjakubowsky@alkeoncapital.com or telephone
at (212)  389-8710  in order to obtain  information  on how  Alkeon  voted  such
client's proxies,  and to request a copy of these policies and procedures.  If a
client requests this information,  the Compliance  Officer will prepare a report
to the client that lists,  with  respect to each voted proxy that the client has
inquired about, (1) the name of the issuer;  (2) the proposal voted upon and (3)
how Alkeon voted the client's proxy.

     (b) A concise summary of these Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures will be
included  in  Alkeon's  Form ADV Part II,  and will be  updated  whenever  these
policies and procedures are updated.  The Compliance  Officer will arrange for a
copy of this  summary to be sent to all  existing  clients  either as a separate
mailing or along with a periodic account statement or other  correspondence sent
to clients.

VI.  RECORDKEEPING

     The  Compliance  Officer will  maintain  files  relating to Alkeon's  proxy
voting procedures in Alkeon's office at 350 Madison Avenue, 9th Floor, New York,
NY 10017.  Records will be maintained  and preserved for five years from the end
of the  fiscal  year  during  which the last  entry  was made on a record,  with
records  for the first two years kept in the  offices of Alkeon.  Records of the
following will be included in the files:

     (a)  Copies  of  these  proxy  voting  policies  and  procedures,  and  any
amendments thereto.

     (b) A copy of each proxy statement that Alkeon  receives,  provided however
that  Alkeon may rely on  obtaining  a copy of proxy  statements  from the SEC's
EDGAR system for those proxy statements that are so available.

     (c) A record of each vote that Alkeon casts on behalf of clients.

     (d) A copy of each written  client  request for  information  on how Alkeon
voted such client's proxies,  and a copy of any written response to any (written
or oral) client request for information on how Alkeon voted its proxies.

     (e) A copy of any  document  Alkeon  created  that was material to making a
decision how to vote proxies, or that memorializes the basis for decision.

                                  INTRODUCTION

Rule 206(4)-6 (the "Rule") adopted under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the "Advisers  Act") requires all registered  investment  advisers that
exercise voting  discretion  over securities held in client  portfolios to adopt
proxy voting policies and procedures.

Advantage Advisers,  L.L.C.,  Advantage Advisers Management,  L.L.C.,  Advantage
Advisers  Multi-Manager,  L.L.C.,  Advantage Advisers Private Equity Management,
L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Augusta Management,  L.L.C., Advantage Advisers Troon
Management, L.L.C., and Oppenheimer Catalyst Management,  L.P.(collectively, the
"Advisers")  are registered  investment  advisers under the Advisers Act and are
therefore required to adopt proxy voting policies and procedures pursuant to the
Rule.

The  Advisers  act as  investment  advisers,  managers  or general  partners  to
registered  and   unregistered   investment   companies  and  managed   accounts
(collectively,  the "Accounts").  When an Adviser has investment discretion over
an  Account's  investment  portfolio,  then the  Adviser  votes  proxies for the
Account pursuant to the policies and procedures set forth herein.

Investment  discretion  for a number of the  Advisers'  Accounts is exercised by
portfolio managers that are either  non-managing  members of limited partners of
an Adviser,  or act as portfolio managers or subadvisers  pursuant to agreements
with the Advisers and/or the Accounts (collectively,  the "Portfolio Managers").
In all cases where Portfolio  Managers exercise  investment  discretion over the
Accounts,  the  Portfolio  Managers  vote proxies for the Accounts in accordance
with the policies and procedures of the investment advisory firms with which the
Portfolio Managers are affiliated.

Appendix A hereto sets forth the Accounts for which each Adviser is responsible,
whether the  Advisers'  proxy  policies or the proxy  policies of the  Portfolio
Managers are applicable to the Account.

                           VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES
                            IN UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS
                           ----------------------------

These proposals seek shareholder  votes for persons who have been nominated by a
corporation's  board of  directors  to stand for election to serve as members of
that board. No candidates are opposing these board nominees.

In each analysis of an uncontested election of directors you should review:

          a) Company performance

          b) Composition of the board and key board committees

          c) Attendance at board meetings

          d) Corporate governance provisions and takeover activity

We may also consider:


          a) Board decisions concerning executive compensation

          b) Number of other board seats held by the nominee

          c) Interlocking directorships


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                            It is our policy to vote IN FAVOR of
                                           the candidates proposed by the board.

We will look  carefully at each  candidate's  background  contained in the proxy
statement.  In the  absence of  unusual  circumstances  suggesting  a nominee is
clearly  not  qualified  to serve as a member  of the  board,  we will vote with
management.

CHAIRMAN AND CEO ARE THE SAME PERSON
- ------------------------------------

         Shareholders  may propose that different  persons hold the positions of
the chairman and the CEO.

         We would evaluate these  proposals on a case by case basis depending on
the size of the company and performance of management.

INDEPENDENCE OF DIRECTORS
- -------------------------

         Shareholders  may request  that the board be comprised of a majority of
         independent  directors  and that  audit,  compensation  and  nominating
         committees of the Board consists exclusively of independent  directors.
         We believe  that  independent  directors  are  important  to  corporate
         governance.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION                     It is our  policy to vote FOR  proposals
                                        requesting  that a majority of the Board
                                        be  independent   and  that  the  audit,
                                        compensation  and nominating  committees
                                        of the board  include  only  independent
                                        directors.

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS
- ----------------------------

         Shareholders  may propose  that  directors be required to own a minimum
amount of company stock or that directors  should be paid in company stock,  not
cash.  This proposal is based on the view that directors  will align  themselves
with the  interest  of  shareholders  if they are  shareholders  themselves.  We
believe that  directors  are required to exercise  their  fiduciary  duty to the
company and its  shareholders  whether or not they own shares in the company and
should be  allowed  to  invest  in  company  stock  based on their own  personal
considerations.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION


                                                     Vote AGAINST proposals that
                                                require director stock ownership

                            CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS
                            -------------------------
         Charitable   contributions   by  companies  are  generally  useful  for
         assisting  worthwhile  causes and for  creating  goodwill  between  the
         company and its  community.  Moreover,  there may be certain  long-term
         financial benefits to companies from certain  charitable  contributions
         generated from, for example,  movies spent helping  educational efforts
         in the firm's primary employment areas.  Shareholders should not decide
         what the most worthwhile charities are.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                                        (Shareholders Proposals)
                                                Vote AGAINST proposals regarding
                                                        charitable contribution.

         Shareholders  have  differing  and  equally  sincere  views as to which
         charities the company  should  contribute  to, and the amount it should
         contribute.  In  the  absence  of bad  faith,  self-dealing,  or  gross
         negligence,  management should determine which contributions are in the
         best interest of the company.

                      DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION
                            AND LIABILITY PROTECTION
                      -------------------------------------

         These  proposals   typically  provide  for  protection  (or  additional
         protection)  which is to be afforded to the  directors of a corporation
         in the form of indemnification  by the corporation,  insurance coverage
         or  limitations   upon  their   liability  in  connection   with  their
         responsibilities as directors.

         When a corporation indemnifies its directors and officers, it means the
         corporation  promises to  reimburse  them for certain  legal  expenses,
         damages,  and judgements  incurred as a result of lawsuits  relating to
         their corporate  actions.  The corporation  becomes the insurer for its
         officers and directors.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals that eliminate
                                        entirely director and officers'
                                        liability for monetary damages for
                                        violating the duty of care.

                                        Vote AGAINST indemnification proposals
                                        that would expand coverage beyond just
                                        legal expenses to acts, such as
                                        negligence, that are more serious
                                        violations of fiduciary obligations than
                                        mere carelessness.

                                        Vote FOR only those proposals providing
                                        such expanded coverage in cases when a
                                        director's or officer's legal defense
                                        was unsuccessful if: a) the director was
                                        found to have acted in good faith, and
                                        b) only if the director's legal expenses
                                        would be covered.

         The following factors should be considered:

          1.   The present environment in which directors operate provides
               substantial risk of claims or suits against against them in their
               individual capacities arising out of the discharge of their
               duties.

          2.   Attracting and retaining the most qualified directors enhances
               shareholder value.

                            SIZE OF THE BOARD
                            ------------------

         Typically  there are three  reasons for changing the size of the board.
         The  first  reason  may  be to  permit  inclusion  into  the  board  of
         additional  individuals who, by virtue of their ability and experience,
         would benefit the  corporation.  The second reason may be to reduce the
         size of the board due to  expiration of terms,  resignation  of sitting
         directors or, thirdly, to accommodate the corporation's changing needs.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR the board's recommendation to
                                        increase or decrease the size of the
                                        board.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   These proposals may aim at reducing or increasing the influence
               of certain groups of individuals.

          2.   This is an issue with which the board of directors is uniquely
               qualified to deal, since they have the most experience in sitting
               on a board and are up-to-date on the specific needs of the
               corporation.

VOTING ON DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS
- --------------------------------------------------

Votes in contested elections of directors are evaluated on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.
The following factors are considered:

              1.     management's track record
              2.     background to the proxy contest
              3.     qualifications of director nominees

                                 --------------

This is a shareholder's proposal to limit the tenure of outside directors.  This
requirement may not be an appropriate one. It is an artificial imposition on the
board,  and may have the result of  removing  knowledgeable  directors  from the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to
                                        limit the tenure of outside directors.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   An experienced director should not be disqualified because he or
               she has served a certain number of years.

          2.   The nominating committee is in the best position to judge the
               directors' terms in office due to their understanding of a
               corporation's needs and a director's abilities and experience.

          3.   If shareholders are not satisfied with the job a director is
               doing, they can vote him/her off the board when the term is up.

                             COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE
                             -----------------------

These  proposals  seek  shareholder  approval  of a  request  that the  board of
directors disclose the amount of compensation paid to officers and employees, in
addition  to the  disclosure  of such  information  in the  proxy  statement  as
required by the SEC regulations.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        (shareholders policy) Vote AGAINST these
                                        proposals that require disclosure,
                                        unless we have reason to believe that
                                        mandated disclosures are insufficient to
                                        give an accurate and meaningful account
                                        of senior management compensation.


The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Federal securities laws require disclosure in corporate proxy
               statements of the compensation paid to corporate directors and
               officers.

          2.   Employees other than executive officers and directors are
               typically not in policy-making roles where they have the ability
               to determine, in a significant way, the amount of their own
               compensation.

          3.   The disclosure of compensation of lower-level officers and
               employees infringes upon their privacy and might create morale
               problems.

<PAGE>



RATIFYING AUDITORS

Shareholders  must make certain  that  auditors are  responsibly  examining  the
financial  statements of a company,  that their reports  adequately  express any
legitimate  financial  concerns,  and that the  auditor  is  independent  of the
company it is serving.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR proposal to ratify auditors.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Although lawsuits are sometimes filed against accounting firms,
               including those nationally recognized, these firms typically
               complete their assignments in a lawful and professional manner.

          2.   Sometimes it may be appropriate for a corporation to change
               accounting firms, but the board of directors is in the best
               position to judge the advantages of any such change and any
               disagreements with former auditors must be fully disclosed to
               shareholders.

          3.   If there is a reason to believe the independent auditor has
               rendered an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of
               the company's financial position, then in this case vote AGAINST
               ratification.

                                  POISON PILLS
                                  ------------

Poison pills are  corporate-sponsored  financial devices that, when triggered by
potential acquirers,  do one or more of the following:  a) dilute the acquirer's
equity in the target company,  b) dilute the acquirer's  voting interests in the
target company,  or c) dilute the acquirer's  equity holdings in the post-merger
company.  Generally,  poison pills  accomplish  these tasks by issuing rights or
warrants to shareholders  that are essentially  worthless  unless triggered by a
hostile acquisition attempt.

A poison pill should  contain a redemption  clause that would allow the board to
redeem it even after a potential acquirer has surpassed the ownership threshold.
Poison  pills may be  adopted by the board  without  shareholder  approval.  But
shareholders  must have the  opportunity to ratify or reject them at least every
two years.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking
                                        that a company submit its poison pill
                                        for shareholder ratification.

                                        Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis regarding
                                        shareholder proposals to redeem a
                                        company's poison pill.

                                        Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis regarding
                                        management proposals to ratify a poison
                                        pill.

                                    GREENMAIL
                                    ---------
Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from individuals or groups seeking control of the company.
Since only the hostile party receives payment,  usually at a substantial premium
over the market, the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.

Greenmail  payments  usually expose the company to negative press and may result
in lawsuits by  shareholders.  When a company's  name is associated  with such a
practice,  company  customers may think twice about future purchases made at the
expense of the shareholders.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR proposals to adopt anti
                                        Greenmail or bylaw amendments or
                                        otherwise restrict a company's ability
                                        to make Greenmail payments

                                        Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis regarding
                                        anti-Greenmail proposals when they are
                                        bundled with other charter or bylaw
                                        amendments.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   While studies by the SEC and others show that Greenmail devalues
               the company's stock price, an argument can be made that a payment
               can enable the company to pursue plans that may provide long-term
               gains to the shareholders.

                               SUPERMAJORITY VOTE
                               ------------------
Supermajority  provisions violate the principle that a simple majority of voting
shares should be all that is necessary to effect change  regarding a company and
its corporate governance  provisions.  These proposals seek shareholder approval
to exceed the normal level of  shareholder  participation  and  approval  from a
simple majority of the outstanding shares to a much higher percentage.


VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                        Vote AGAINST management proposals to
                                        require a Supermajority shareholder vote
                                        to approve mergers and other significant
                                        business combinations.

                                        Vote FOR shareholder proposals to lower
                                        Supermajority vote requirements for
                                        mergers and other significant business
                                        combinations.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Supermajority requirements ensure broad agreement on issues that
               may have a significant impact on the future of the company.

          2.   Supermajority vote may make action all but impossible.

          3.   Supermajority requirements are counter to the principle of
               majority rule.

                             -----------------------
This proposal seeks shareholder approval to change the corporation's name. It is
probably better to vote for the proposed name change before management goes back
to the drawing board and spends another small fortune attempting again to change
the name.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR changing the corporate name.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   A name of a corporation symbolizes its substance.

          2.   There are many reasons a corporation may have for changing its
               name, including an intention to change the direction of the
               business or to have a contemporary corporate image.

          3.   The board of directors is well-positioned to determine the best
               name for the corporation because, among other reasons, it usually
               seeks professional advice on such matters.

                                 ---------------

These proposals seek shareholder approval to change the state in which a company
is incorporated. Sometimes this is done to accommodate the company's most active
operations  or  headquarters.   More  often,  however,  the  companies  want  to
reincorporate  in  a  state  with  more  stringent   anti-takeover   provisions.
Delaware's  state laws,  for instance,  including  liability  and  anti-takeover
provisions, are more favorable to corporations.



VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, carefully
                                        reviewing the new state's laws and any
                                        significant changes the company makes in
                                        its charter and by-laws.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   The board is in the best position to determine the company's need
               to incorporate.

          2.   Reincorporation may have considerable implications for
               shareholders, affecting a company's takeover defenses, its
               corporate structure or governance features.

          3.   Reincorporation in a state with stronger anti-takeover laws may
               harm shareholder value.

                 BOARD STRUCTURE: STAGGERED VS. ANNUAL ELECTIONS
                 -----------------------------------------------

A company that has classified, or staggered, board is one in which directors are
typically divided into three classes,  with each class serving three-year terms;
each class's reelection occurs in different years. In contrast, all directors of
an  annually  elected  board  serve  one-year  and the entire  board  stands for
election each year.

Classifying  the board makes it more  difficult  to change  control of a company
through a proxy contest involving election of directors. Because only a minority
of the directors are elected each year, it will be more difficult to win control
of the board in a single election.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals to classify the
                                        board. Vote FOR proposals to repeal
                                        classified boards and to elect all
                                        directors annually.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   The annual election of directors provides an extra check on
               management's performance. A director who is doing a good job
               should not fear an annual review of his/her directorship.

                                CUMULATIVE VOTING
                                -----------------

Most companies  provide that shareholders are entitled to cast one vote for each
share owned, the so-called "one share,  one vote" standard.  This proposal seeks
to  allow  each   shareholder  to  cast  votes  in  the  election  of  directors
proportionate  to the number of  directors  times the number of shares  owned by
each shareholder for one nominee.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals that permit
                                        cumulative voting.


The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Cumulative voting would allow a minority owner to create an
               impact disproportionate to his/her holdings.

          2.   Cumulative voting can be used to elect a director who would
               represent special interests and not those of the corporation and
               its shareholders.

          3.   Cumulative voting can allow a minority to have representation.

          4.   Cumulative Voting can lead to a conflict within the board which
               could interfere with its ability to serve the shareholders' best
               interests.

                  SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETING
                  ---------------------------------------------

Most state  corporation  statutes allow  shareholders  to call a special meeting
when they want to take action on certain  matters that arise  between  regularly
scheduled annual meetings.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or
                                        prohibit shareholder ability to call
                                        special meetings.

                                        Vote FOR proposals that remove
                                        restrictions on the right of
                                        shareholders to act independently of
                                        management.

                SHAREHOLDERS' ABILITY TO ALTER SIZE OF THE BOARD
                ------------------------------------------------

Proposals  which would allow  management to increase or decrease the size of the
board at its own discretion are often used by companies as a takeover defense.

Shareholders should support management proposals to fix the size of the board at
a specific number of directors,  preventing  management from increasing the size
of the board without shareholder  approval. By increasing the size of the board,
management  can make it more  difficult  for  dissidents  to gain control of the
board.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                        Vote FOR proposal which seek to fix the
                                        size of the board.

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals which give
                                        management the ability to alter the size
                                        of the board without shareholder
                                        approval.

                               -------------------

Confidential  voting,  also known as voting by secret ballot,  is one of the key
structural  issues  in the  proxy  system.  All  proxies,  ballots,  and  voting
tabulations that identify individual shareholders are kept confidential.

VOTE RECOMMENDATIONS

                                        Vote FOR shareholder proposals
                                        requesting that corporations adopt
                                        confidential voting.

                                        Vote FOR management proposals to adopt
                                        confidential voting.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Some shareholders elect to have the board not know how they voted
               on certain issues.

          2.   Should the board be aware of how a shareholder voted, the board
               could attempt to influence the shareholder to change his/her
               vote, giving itself an advantage over those that do not have
               access to this information.

          3.   Confidential voting is an important element of corporate
               democracy which should be available to the shareholder.

                         SHAREHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEES
                         -------------------------------

These proposals  request that the corporation  establish a shareholder  advisory
committee to review the board's performance.  In some instances, it would have a
budget  funded by the  corporation  and would be composed of salaried  committee
members with  authority to hire  outside  experts and to include  reports in the
annual proxy statement.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals to establish a
                                        shareholder advisory committee.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Directors already have fiduciary responsibility to represent
               shareholders and are accountable to them by law, thus rendering
               shareholder advisory committees unnecessary.

          2.   Adding another layer to the current corporate governance system
               would be expensive and unproductive.

                            FOREIGN CORPORATE MATTERS
                            -------------------------

These proposals are usually submitted by companies  incorporated  outside of the
United States  seeking  shareholder  approval for actions  which are  considered
ordinary business and do not require  shareholder  approval in the United States
(i.e., declaration of dividends, approval of financial statements, etc.).

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR proposals that concern foreign
                                        companies incorporated outside of the
                                        United States.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   The laws and regulations of various countries differ widely as to
               those issues on which shareholder approval is needed, usually
               requiring consent for actions which are considered routine in the
               United States.

          2.   The board of directors is well-positioned to determine whether or
               not these types of actions are in the best interest of the
               corporation's shareholders.

                             GOVERNMENT SERVICE LIST

This proposal  requests that the board of directors  prepare a list of employees
or consultants to the company who have been employed by the government  within a
specified period of time and the substance of their involvement.

Solicitation  of customers and  negotiation  of  contractual  or other  business
relationships is traditionally the responsibility of management.  Compilation of
such a list does not seem to serve a useful purpose,  primarily because existing
laws and regulations serve as a checklist on conflicts of interest.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST these proposals which a
                                        request a list of employees having been
                                        employed by the government.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   For certain companies, employing individuals familiar with the
               regulatory agencies and procedures is essential and, therefore,
               is in the best interests of the shareholders.

          2.   Existing laws and regulations require enough disclosure and serve
               as a check on conflicts of interest.

          3.   Additional disclosure would be an unreasonable invasion of such
               individual's privacy.

                         -------------------------------

CERES  proposals ask management to sign or report on process  toward  compliance
with  ten  principles  committing  the  company  to  environmental  stewardship.
Principle  10  directs  companies  to fill out the  CERES  report.  This  report
requires companies to disclose information about environmental  policies,  toxic
emissions,  hazardous  waste  management,  workplace  safety,  energy  use,  and
environmental audits.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals requesting that
                                        companies sign the CERES Principles.


The following factors should be considered:

          1.   We do not believe a concrete business case is made for this
               proposal. In our opinion, the company will be best served by
               continuing to carry on its business as it did before the proposal
               was made.

                              (MACBRIDE PRINCIPLES)
                              ---------------------

It is well  documented  that Northern  Ireland's  Catholic  community faces much
higher unemployment  figures then the Protestant  community.  Most proposals ask
companies  to  endorse  or report  on  progress  with  respect  to the  MacBride
Principles.

In  evaluating a proposal to adopt the MacBride  Principles,  you must decide if
the  principles  will  cause the  company to  divest,  and  worsen  unemployment
problems.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                        REFRAIN from voting on proposals that
                                        request companies to adopt the MacBride
                                        Principles.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   We believe that human and political rights are of the utmost
               importance for their own sake as well as for the enhancement of
               economic potential of a nation.

          2.   We do not believe a concrete business case has been made for this
               proposal. We will refrain from making social or political
               statements by voting for these proposals. We will only vote on
               proposals that maximize the value of the issuers' status without
               regard to (i.e., we will not pass judgement upon) the
               non-economic considerations.

                      INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND POLICIES
                      -------------------------------------

Proposals  in this area  generally  request  companies  to report on or to adopt
certain principles regarding their operations in foreign countries.

The  Maquiladora  Standards  are a set  of  guidelines  that  outline  how  U.S.
companies  should conduct  operations in Maquiladora  facilities just across the
U.S.-Mexican border. These standards cover such topics as community development,
environmental  policies,   health  and  safety  policies,  and  fair  employment
practices.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION                     ABSTAIN from providing a vote
                                        recommendation on proposals regarding

                                        international operating policies.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   We believe that human rights are of the utmost importance for
               their own sake as well as for the enhancement of economic
               potential of a nation.

          2.   We do not believe that a concrete business case has been made for
               these proposals. We will refrain from making social statements by
               voting for these proposals. We will not only vote on proposals
               that maximize the value of the issuers' securities without regard
               to (i.e., we will not pass judgement upon) the non-economic
               considerations.

                               AND DISCRIMINATION
                          ----------------------------

In  regards  to  equal   employment  and   discrimination,   companies   without
comprehensive EEO programs will find it hard to recruit qualified  employees and
find  them  at a  long-term  competitive  disadvantage.  Companies  who  are not
carefully watching their human resource practices could also face lawsuits.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        REFRAIN from voting on any proposals
                                        regarding equal employment opportunities
                                        and discrimination.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   We feel that the hiring and promotion of employees should be free
               from prohibited discriminatory practices. We also feel that many
               of these issues are already subject to significant state and
               federal regulations.

A Corporation  is requested to issue a report on its progress  towards  reducing
reliance on animal tests for consumer product safety.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        REFRAIN from making vote recommendations
                                        on proposals regarding animal rights.


The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Needless cruelty to animals should never be tolerated. However,
               the testing of products on animals may be very important to the
               health and safety of consumers.

          2.   We also feel that this issue is already subject to significant
               state and federal regulation.

                           COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZATION
                           --------------------------

The ability to increase the number of authorized  shares could  accommodate  the
sale of equity,  stock splits,  dividends,  compensation-based  plans,  etc. The
board can usually be trusted to use additional  shares for  capital-raising  and
other transactions that are in the corporation's best interests.

However,  excessive  escalation in the number of authorized shares may allow the
board to  radically  change  the  corporation's  direction  without  shareholder
approval. Be careful to view that the increased number of shares will not enable
the company to activate a poison pill.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals increase
                                        the number of shares of common stock
                                        authorized for issue.

                                        Vote AGAINST proposed common share
                                        authorization that increase existing
                                        authorization by more then 100 percent
                                        unless a clear need for the excess
                                        shares is presented by the company.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Is this company going to make frequent business acquisitions over
               a period of time?

          2.   Is the company expanding its operations?

          3.   Within the company, are there any debt structuring or prepackaged
               bankruptcy plans?

                           BLANK CHECK PREFERRED STOCK
                           ---------------------------

The terms of blank check  preferred  stock give the board of directors the power
to issue shares of preferred stock at their discretion, with voting, conversion,
distribution  and other rights to be  determined by the board at the time of the
issue.

Blank check  preferred  stock can provide  corporations  with the flexibility to
meet changing  financial  conditions.  However,  once the blank check  preferred
stock has been authorized,  the  shareholders  have no further power over how or
when it will be allocated.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals authorizing the
                                        creation of new classes of preferred
                                        stock with unspecified voting,
                                        conversion, dividend distribution, and
                                        other rights.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Blank check preferred stock can be used as the vehicle for a
               poison pill defense against hostile suitors, or it may be placed
               in friendly hands to help block a takeover bid.

                                PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

These proposals request that the corporation provide existing  shareholders with
an  opportunity  to acquire  additional  shares in proportion to their  existing
holdings  whenever new shares are issued.  In companies with a large shareholder
base and ease in which  shareholders  could  preserve  their  relative  interest
through  purchases  of  shares  on the open  market,  the  cost of  implementing
preemptive rights does not seem justifiable in relation to the benefits.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals seeking
                                        preemptive rights.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   The existence of preemptive rights can considerably slow down the
               process of issuing new shares due to the logistics involved in
               protecting such rights.

          2.   Preemptive rights are not necessary for the shareholder in
               today's corporations, whose stock is held by a wide range of
               owners and is, in most cases, highly liquid.

                                        will result in an increase of authorized
                                        but unissued shares of more than 100%
                                        after giving effect to the shares needed

                                        increase of authorized but unissued
                                        shares of more than 100% after giving
                                        effect to the shares needed for the

                    ADJUSTMENTS TO PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK
                    ----------------------------------------

The purpose of par value stock is to  establish  the maximum  responsibility  of
stockholder in the event that a corporation becomes insolvent. It represents the
maximum amount that a shareholder must pay the corporation if the stock is to be
fully paid when issued.

The  corporation  requests  permission to reduce the par value of its stock.  In
most cases,  adjusting par value is a routine  financing  decision and should be
supported.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR management proposals to reduce
                                        the par value of common stock.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   State laws sometimes prohibit issuance of new stock priced below
               that of the outstanding shares.

          2.   A corporation may be unable to raise capital if the par value is
               overstated.

DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS
- -------------------

The corporation may propose to increase  common and/or  preferred  shares and to
issue shares as part of a debt restructuring plan.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        It is our policy to vote CASE-BY-CASE on
                                        debt restructuring

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Dilution - How much will ownership interest of existing
               shareholders be reduced and how extreme will dilution to future
               earnings be?

          2.   Change in Control - Will the transaction result in a change of
               control of the company?

          3.   Bankruptcy - Is the threat of bankruptcy, which would result in
               severe losses in shareholder value, the main factor driving the
               debt restructuring?

                              DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Directors represent  shareholders and are responsible for protecting shareholder
interests. Companies state in the proxy material that they pay directors well in
order to attract the most qualified  candidates.  All compensation  packages for
any  executive,  director  or  employee  should  include  a  pay-for-performance
component.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                        Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis for
                                        director compensation.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   As directors take an increasingly active role in corporate
               decision-making and governance, their compensation is becoming
               more performance-based.

            SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL TO LIMIT EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR PAY
            --------------------------------------------------------

Shareholder   compensation   proposals  that  set  limits  or  reduce  executive
compensation  should be  closely  scrutinized.  Many of these  proposals  may be
flawed in their emphasis on an absolute dollar figure in compensation.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION
                                        Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis


The following factors should be considered:

          1.   Executive compensation is established by a committee that
               consists of independent directors who have fiduciary
               responsibility to act in the best interest of the shareholders
               and who are best placed to make compensation decisions.

                     EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS (ESOPS)
                     --------------------------------------

These  proposals ask for stockholder  endorsement of compensation  plans for key
employees  which  involve the  issuance  of company  shares by granting of stock
options,  SARs,  restricted  stock,  etc.  These  plans help  attract and retain
best-qualified corporate personnel and tie their interests more closely to those
of the shareholders.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR proposals to adopt share-based
                                        compensation plans when the following
                                        items are involved:

          1.   The exercise price for stock options is less than 85% of fair
               market value on the date of the grant.

          2.   It is an omnibus stock plan which gives directors broad
               discretion in deciding how much and what kind of stock to award,
               when and to whom.

          3.   The shares for issue exceed 8% of the company's outstanding

               increase exceeds 1.5% of the total number of shares outstanding.

                                        based compensation plans when the
                                        following items are involved:

          1.   Re-load options (new options issued for any exercised).

          2.   The plan would allow for management to pyramid their holdings by
               using stock to purchase more stock, without having to lay out
               cash. Vote YES if this is for directors.

                                GOLDEN PARACHUTES
                                -----------------

Golden  parachutes are designed to protect the employees of a corporation in the
event of a change in control.  The change in control  agreement will specify the
exact  payments  to be made under the golden  parachutes.  The  calculation  for
payout is usually  based on some  multiple  of an  employee's  annual or monthly
compensation.  Golden  parachutes are generally  given to employees whose annual
compensation exceeds $112,000.

Recent experience has shown a willingness of many managements to treat severance
agreements  as  equal to  equity  investments  and to  reward  themselves  as if
substantial amounts of equity were at risk.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote FOR proposals which seek to limit
                                        additional compensation payments.

                                        Vote FOR shareholder proposals to have
                                        golden parachutes submitted for
                                        shareholder ratification.


The following factors should be considered:

          1.   The stability of management may be affected by an attempted
               acquisition of the corporation.

          2.   There is a tendency on the part of an entrenched management to
               overstate the value of their continuing control of and influence
               on the day-to-day functions of a corporation.

                        PROPOSAL TO BAN GOLDEN PARACHUTES
                        ---------------------------------

Based on the foregoing information:

VOTE RECOMMENDATION


                                        We are FOR this proposal, which
                                        essentially bans golden parachutes,
                                        because we feel management's
                                        compensation should be solely based on
                                        real-time contributions to the
                                        corporation while they are serving it.
                                        Deferred current compensation is viewed
                                        differently than future, contingent
                                        compensation for current services.

                                        revoke outside directors' retirement
                                        compensation.

                       CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION STATUTES
                       ----------------------------------

These proposals suggest that the board of directors solicit shareholder approval
before committing acquisitions or divestiture of a business exceeding stipulated
threshold  levels.  Such statutes function by denying shares their voting rights
when they contribute to ownership in excess of certain thresholds.

VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote AGAINST proposals which request the
                                        board to seek shareholder approval
                                        before committing to an acquisition.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   These proposals deprive the board of directors of its ability to
               act quickly in propitious circumstances.

          2.   Conforming to these requirements can be expensive.

          3.   The board of directors is uniquely qualified and positioned to be
               able to make these decisions without prior shareholder approval.

          4.   The threshold levels usually imposed by these proposals are much
               more stringent than required by law.

                       OPT-OUT OF STATE TAKEOVER STATUTES
                       ----------------------------------

These  proposals  seek  shareholder  approval to opt-out  (not be  governed  by)
certain  provisions of the anti-takeover  laws of various states.  Delaware law,
for instance,  dictates that a bidder has to acquire at least 85% of a company's
stock before exercising control, unless he or she has board approval. This means
that a company may thwart an otherwise  successful bidder by securing 15% of its
stock in friendly hands.


VOTE RECOMMENDATION

                                        Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE basis for these
                                        proposals.

The following factors should be considered:

          1.   It is the directors' responsibility to act on behalf of the
               shareholders in opposing coercive takeover attempts.

          2.   Creating deterrents to corporate takeovers may allow for
               entrenchment of inefficient management.

          3.   These statutes strengthen the board's ability to deal with
               potential buyers on fair and reasonable terms.

          4.   Shareholders should have the final say on whether the company
               should be merged or acquired.

 CONFLICTS
 ---------

From time to time,  proxy  voting  proposals  may raise  conflicts  between  the
interests of the  Advisers'  clients and the  interests of the  Advisers,  their
affiliates and their employees. Conflicts of interest may arise when:

          1.   Proxy votes regarding non-routine matters are solicited by an
               issuer that may have a separate account relationship with an
               affiliate of an Adviser or an investment banking relationship
               with Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., an affiliate of the Advisers.

          2.   A proponent of a proxy proposal has a business relationship with
               an Adviser or one of its affiliates or an Adviser or one of its
               affiliates has a business relationship with participants in proxy
               contests, corporate directors or director candidates.

          3.   An employee of an Adviser has a personal interest in the outcome
               of a particular matter before shareholders.

               If an Adviser receives a proxy that to the knowledge of the Proxy
               Manager raises a conflict of interest, the Proxy Manager shall
               advise the Governance Committee which shall determine whether the
               conflict is "material" to any specific proposal involved in the
               proxy. The Governance Committee will determine whether the
               proposal is material as follows:

          1.   Routine proxy proposals are presumed not to involve a material
               conflict of interest.

          2.   Non-routine proxy proposals-Proxy proposals that are "non-
               routine" will be presumed to involve a material conflict of
               interest unless the Governance Committee determines that the
               conflict is unrelated to the proposal. Non-routine proposals
               would include a merger, compensation matters for management and
               contested elections of directors.


62
<PAGE>


CONFLICTS CONT'D

          3.   The Governance Committee may determine on a case by case basis
               that particular non-routine proposals do not involve a material
               conflict of interest because the proposal is not directly related
               to an Adviser's conflict vis-a-vis the issue. The Governance
               Committee will record the basis for any such determination. With
               respect to any proposal that the Governance Committee determines
               presents a material conflict of interest, an Adviser may vote
               regarding that proposal in any of the following ways:

                    a)   Obtain instructions from the client on how to vote.

                    b)   Use existing proxy guidelines if the policy with
                         respect to the proposal is specifically addressed and
                         does not involve a case by case analysis.

                    c)   Vote the proposal that involves the conflict according
                         to the recommendations of an independent third party,
                         including, but not limited to, Institutional Share
                         Services Inc. or Investor Responsibility Research
                         Center.

SPECIAL ISSUES WITH VOTING FOREIGN PROXIES
- ------------------------------------------


    Voting  proxies  with  respect  to  shares  of  foreign  stock  may  involve
significantly  greater effort and corresponding  cost than voting proxies in the
U.S domestic market. Issues in voting foreign proxies include the following:

          1.   Each country has its own rules and practices regarding
               shareholder notification, voting restrictions, registration
               conditions and share blocking.

          2.   In some foreign countries shares may be "blocked" by custodian or
               depository or bearer shares deposited with specific financial
               institutions for a certain number of days before or after the
               shareholders meeting. When blocked, shares typically may not be
               traded until the day after the blocking period. The Advisers may
               refrain from voting shares of foreign stocks subject to blocking
               restrictions where in an Adviser's judgment, the benefit from
               voting the shares is outweighed by the interest in maintaining
               client liquidity in the shares. This decision is made on a case
               by case basis based on relevant factors including the length of
               the blocking period, the significance of the holding and whether
               the stock is considered a long-term holding.


          3.   Time frames between shareholder notification, distribution of
               proxy materials, book closures and the actual meeting date may be
               too short to allow timely action.

          4.   In certain countries, applicable regulations require that votes
               must be made in person at the shareholder meeting. The Advisers
               will weigh the costs and benefits of voting on proxy proposals in
               such countries on a case by case basis and make decisions on
               whether voting on a given proxy proposal is prudent. Generally,
               the Advisers will not vote shares in any such markets on routine
               matters such as uncontested elections of directors, ratification
               of auditors, etc.

RECORD KEEPING

The Advisers will maintain the following records:

          1.   Copies of these policies

          2.   A copy of each proxy statement that an Adviser receives regarding
               client securities. An Adviser may satisfy this requirement by
               relying on a third party to keep copies of proxy statements
               provided that the Adviser has an undertaking from the third party
               to provide a copy of the proxy statement promptly upon request.

          3.   A record of each vote cast on behalf of a client. A third party
               may keep these voting records provided that the Adviser has an
               undertaking from the third party to provide a copy of the record
               promptly upon request.

          4.   A copy of any document created by an Adviser that was material to
               making a decision on how to vote proxies or that memorializes the
               basis for that decision.

          5.   A copy of each written client request for information on how the
               Advisers voted proxies on behalf of the client and a copy of
               written response by an Adviser to any client request for
               information on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the
               client.

The above records shall be maintained  for five years from the end of the fiscal
year during which the last entry was made on such record, the first two years in
an appropriate office of the Advisers.

         POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

          Actual or apparent conflicts of interest may arise when a Portfolio
          Manager also has day-to-day responsibilities with respect to one or
          more accounts. These potential conflicts include:

     o    Allocation of Limited Time and Attention. Because the Portfolio
          Manager manages other accounts, the Portfolio Manager may not be able
          to formulate as complete a strategy or identify equally attractive
          investment opportunities for each of those accounts as if the
          Portfolio Manager were to devote substantially more attention to the
          management of fewer accounts.

     o    Allocation of Investment Opportunities. If the Portfolio Manager
          identifies an investment opportunity that may be suitable for multiple
          accounts, the Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that
          opportunity because the opportunity may need to be allocated among all
          or many of these accounts.

     o    Pursuit of Differing Strategies. At times, the Portfolio Manager may
          determine that an investment opportunity may be appropriate for only
          some of the accounts for which he exercises investment responsibility,
          or may decide that certain of these accounts should take differing
          positions with respect to a particular security. In these cases, the
          Portfolio Manager may execute differing or opposite transactions for
          one or more accounts which may affect the market price of the security
          or the execution of the transactions, or both, to the detriment of one
          or more of his accounts.

     o    Performance Fees. The Portfolio Manager manages other accounts that
          are subject to a performance allocation or performance fee which in
          some cases may be greater than the fee payable by the Fund. This could
          create a conflict because the Portfolio Manager may benefit if a more
          attractive investment is allocated to an account that bears a greater
          performance allocation or fee.

(a)(3)    Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management Team
          Members

          Mr. Sparaggis' compensation consists of periodic advances and the
          income from the profits of Alkeon Capital Management, LLC derived by
          him as its sole principal. The level of Alkeon Capital Management's
          profitability in turn is dependent on the advisory fees and
          performance fees and allocations received from the Fund and other
          advisory clients.

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
               SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO RULES
        PROMULGATED UNDER SECTION 406 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (the "Code") of the registered investment companies
set forth in Exhibit A (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund") applies to
each  Fund's  principal  executive  officer,  principal  financial  officer  and
principal  accounting officer (the "Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth
in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

      o  honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
         relationships;

      o  full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
         and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities
         and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
         by the Fund;

      o  compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

      o  the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
         appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

      o  accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each  Covered  Officer  should  adhere to a high  standard  of business
ethics and should be  sensitive  to  situations  that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW.  A "conflict  of  interest"  occurs when a Covered  Officer's
private  interest  interferes  with the interests  of, or the Covered  Officer's
service to, a Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered
Officer, or a member of the Covered Officer's family, receives improper personal
benefits as a result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

         Certain  conflicts of interest arise out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and a Fund and  already  are  subject to conflict of interest
provisions  in the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended  ("Investment
Company Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended  ("Investment
Advisers Act"). For example,  Covered  Officers may not  individually  engage in
certain  transactions  (such  as the  purchase  or sale of  securities  or other
property)  with a Fund  because of their status as  "affiliated  persons" of the
Fund.  The  compliance  programs and  procedures of each Fund and its investment
adviser are designed to prevent,  or identify and correct,  violations  of these
provisions.  This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and  procedures,  and such  conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code.  Although  typically  not  presenting  an  opportunity  for  improper
personal  benefit,  conflicts


<PAGE>

may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship  between a Fund
and its  investment  adviser  or a third  party  service  provider  of which the
Covered  Officers  are also  officers  or  employees.  As a  result,  this  Code
recognizes that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether  formally for the applicable  Fund or for its  investment  adviser or a
third  party  service  provider,  or for one or more of them),  be  involved  in
establishing  policies  and  implementing  decisions  that will  have  different
effects on the adviser, third party service provider and Fund. The participation
of the Covered  Officers  in such  activities  is  inherent  in the  contractual
relationship  between a Fund and its adviser or third party service provider and
is consistent  with the  performance by the Covered  Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. The foregoing activities,  if performed in conformity with
the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers Act,
will be deemed to have been handled ethically.

         Other  conflicts  of  interest  are  covered by the Code,  even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to  provisions in the  Investment  Company
Act and the Investment  Advisers Act. The overarching  principle with respect to
all conflicts of interest covered by the Code is that the personal interest of a
Covered  Officer  should not be placed  improperly  before the  interest  of the
Company.

         Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

      o  not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
         influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
         whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment
         of the Fund;

      o  not cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
         individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
         benefit the Fund; and

      o  report at least annually his or her affiliations or other relationships
         that could potentially present a conflict of interest with the Fund.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

      o  Each Covered Officer of a Fund shall become familiar with the
         disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Fund;

      o  each Covered Officer of a Fund shall not knowingly misrepresent, or
         cause others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether
         within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's management and
         auditors, and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
         organizations;

      o  each Covered Officer of a Fund may, to the extent appropriate within
         the Covered Officer's area of responsibility and to the extent deemed
         necessary in the sole discretion of the Covered Officer, consult with
         other officers and employees of the Fund and its investment adviser
         with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
         understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by
         the Fund; and
                                      -2-
<PAGE>


      o  each Covered Officer should seek to promote the Fund's  compliance by a
         Fund with applicable  standards and restrictions  imposed by applicable
         laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer of a Fund must:

      o  upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
         Covered  Officer),  affirm in writing to the Compliance  Officer of the
         Fund that the Covered  Officer has received,  read and  understands the
         Code;

      o  annually  thereafter affirm to the Compliance  Officer of the Fund that
         the Covered Officer has complied with the requirements of the Code;

      o  not retaliate  against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
         Fund or its affiliated  persons for reports of potential  violations of
         the Code that are made in good faith; and

      o  notify the  Compliance  Officer  of the Fund  promptly  if the  Covered
         Officer knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself
         a violation of this Code.

         The Compliance  Officer of a Fund is responsible for applying this Code
to specific  situations in which  questions  are presented  under it and has the
authority to interpret  this Code in any  particular  situation.  The Compliance
Officer of the Fund is authorized to consult,  as  appropriate,  with counsel to
the Fund  and  counsel  to the  Managers  of the  Fund  who are not  "interested
persons," as defined by Section  2(a)(19) of the Investment  Company Act, of the
Fund (the  "Independent  Managers"),  and is encouraged to do so.  However,  any
approvals or waivers(1) must be considered by the Independent Managers.

         Each Fund will follow these procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

      o  the Compliance  Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
         any reported potential violations;

      o  if, after such  investigation,  the Compliance Officer believes that no
         violation has occurred,  the Compliance Officer is not required to take
         any further action;

      o  any matter that the Compliance  Officer believes is a violation will be
         reported to the Independent Managers;

      o  if the Independent  Managers concur that a violation has occurred,  the
         Compliance  Officer will inform and make a recommendation to the Board,
         which will consider  appropriate action, which may include a review of,
         and appropriate  modifications to, applicable  policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate  personnel of the Fund's investment adviser
         or other relevant service provider;  or a recommendation to dismiss the
         Covered Officer; and


- ---------------
(1)  For this purpose,  the term "waiver" includes the approval by the Fund of a
     material  departure  from a  provision  of the code of ethics or the Fund's
     failure to take  action  within a  reasonable  period of time  regarding  a
     material  departure  from a  provision  of the code of ethics that has been
     made known to Fund management.

      o  any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
         disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the Funds for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of each Fund, the Fund's  investment  adviser,  principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions  of this  Code.  The  code of  ethics  under  Rule  17j-1  under  the
Investment  Company  Act of each Fund,  its  investment  adviser  and  principal
underwriter  is a separate  requirement  applying  to the Covered  Officers  and
others, and is not part of this Code.


VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Amendments  to this  Code  may be made  from  time to time,  as  deemed
appropriate by each Fund's Compliance  Officer.  The Board of each Fund shall be
informed  of any such  amendment  to the extent  deemed  material  by the Fund's
Compliance Officer.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All  reports  and records  relating  to a Fund  prepared or  maintained
pursuant to this Code will be  considered  confidential  and shall be maintained
and  protected  accordingly.  Except as otherwise  required by law or this Code,
such matters  shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Fund's  investment
adviser or Board, counsel to the Fund and counsel to the Independent Managers.


VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended  solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not  constitute  an  admission,  by or on behalf  of any  Fund,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
