Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return, net asset
value (NAV) and common share market price will fluctuate and trust shares, when
sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

As a result of recent market activity, current performance may vary from the
figures shown. For more up-to-date information, please visit vankampen.com or
speak with your financial advisor. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share
market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust
at a given time. Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors,
including supply and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an
investment at the beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for
the period in accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale
of all shares at the end of the period.

The Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based statistical
composite of New York municipal bonds. The index is unmanaged and does not

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2003

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals is managed by the
adviser's Municipal Fixed Income team.(1) Current members include Dennis
Pietrzak, Executive Director; Robert Wimmel, Vice President; and John
Reynoldson, Executive Director.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The economic backdrop for the 12 months ended October 31 was largely
characterized by the persistent weakness of the U.S. economy. One of the most
closely watched economic indicators, employment strength, was in negative
territory for much of the period. Repeated comments from government and
private-sector economists suggesting that the U.S. economy might be entering a
deflationary period also seemed to weigh heavily on the minds of investors over
the course of the year. At the same time, ongoing budgetary and fiscal
difficulties at the state and local level contributed to ratings downgrades for
many municipal bonds. The Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) attempted to allay
these fears and keep the economy moving in the right direction by cutting the
Fed Funds target rate twice during the period to a level of 1.00 percent.
Although the stock markets appeared to look past the sluggish economic data,
bonds, in general, were hampered.

While yields on intermediate- and long-term bonds ended the period roughly where
they began, the road between those two points was decidedly bumpy. The 12-month
period can be divided into two distinct market environments. The first of these,
which lasted from October 2002 to mid-June 2003, saw municipal yields fall by
roughly 80 basis points to levels not seen since the late 1960s. These
plummeting yields led to a surge in issuance as municipalities moved to lock in
low financing and, in the case of older bonds, low refinancing costs. These
record levels of supply met with substantial demand as investors in search of
relative stability poured cash into municipal bond funds. Demand for municipal
bonds was also strong from so-called "cross-over" buyers--investors who
traditionally favor taxable investments, but were drawn to the relatively
attractive yields of municipal bonds.

The municipal market reversed abruptly in mid-June, when yields began to climb
from their lows. Investors during this phase shifted their attention to the
advancing equity market, which reduced demand for municipal bonds. Interest from
cross-over investors also evaporated as the relative attractiveness of the
taxable market returned. Issuance remained strong throughout this leg of the
period, though it abated somewhat in the last three months of the reporting
year. These forces combined to drive municipal bond yields off of their historic
lows, ending the period where they began.

The New York economy faced enormous challenges during the period, with Wall
Street revenues and general tax receipts across the state declining. Demand for
New York debt remained strong, however, and helped support price levels in spite
of these challenges. State and local municipalities were quick to respond to
this demand by stepping up their issuance of new and refinanced debt.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while market
price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ significantly. On both a market price and an NAV basis, the
trust outperformed its benchmark, the Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond
Index. (See table below.)

The trust's significant position in health-care bonds generated attractive
income, as well as price appreciation driven by yield-seeking investors drawn to
the bonds' relatively robust yields. Certain issues in this sector met their
investment objectives during the period, and we subsequently sold them in favor
of bonds with superior total-return potential. In addition, a significant number
of the trust's bonds were pre-refunded during the period; in many cases, the
bonds were pre-refunded at prices higher than their acquisition price. Our
strategy of avoiding housing bonds also helped the trust; the sector performed
poorly amidst record levels of mortgage refinancing activity.

While the trust outperformed its benchmark, not all of its positions performed
strongly over the entire period in question. With interest rates falling to
historic lows during the period, our analysis showed an increasing possibility
of a damaging upward shift in interest rates. We positioned the trust
defensively by maintaining a duration (a measure of interest-rate sensitivity)
that was slightly shorter than that of the benchmark during the period. This
position helped the trust when rates climbed, but kept it from fully
participating in the bond market rally earlier in the period.

We were equally defensive in managing the portfolio's maturity structure. Given
the steepness of the yield curve for much of the period (steepness is a measure

of the difference in yields between long- and short-maturity securities), we
focused on a strategy designed to outperform in a curve-flattening environment.
We purchased premium bonds in the 15- to 22-year range that were priced to
10-year call dates. These bonds offer attractive yields compared to bonds with
similar interest-rate risk. We sold bonds in the 5- to 10-year range, an area of
the curve that we feel will underperform when short rates rise. This curve
flattening did not occur as early as we anticipated, however, and the strategy
hampered performance when short rates fell in the first part of the period.
However, when long-bond yields rose in the latter part of the period, our
emphasis on defensive bonds in the 15- to 22-year range helped to preserve
principal.

During the period, many municipalities in New York faced budget shortfalls and
potential credit downgrades. In this challenging environment, we invested in the
highest credit-quality tiers of New York's municipal bond market. As of October
31, 2003, approximately 90 percent of the trust's long-term investments were
invested in bonds rated AA and above. We will continue with our disciplined
investment approach, monitoring the market closely for compelling opportunities.

(a)As required, effective November 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   accreting market discount on fixed income securities. The effect of this
   change for the period ended October 31, 2002 was to increase net investment
   income per share by $.01, decrease net realized and unrealized gains and
   losses per share by $.01 and increase the ratio of net investment income to
   average net assets applicable to common shares by .05%. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for periods prior to October 31, 2002 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(b)Total return assumes an investment at the common share market price at the
   beginning of the period indicated, reinvestment of all distributions for the
   period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of
   all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the period
   indicated.

(c)Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders.

(d)Ratios reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(e)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

October 31, 2003

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust") is
registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to provide a high level of current income exempt from
federal as well as New York State and New York City income taxes, consistent
with preservation of capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its
assets in New York municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of
investment. The Trust commenced investment operations on March 27, 1992.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At October 31, 2003, the Trust had $1,406,285 of when-issued
and delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually on a pro rata basis to common and preferred
shareholders. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may
include short-term capital gains, which are included as ordinary income for tax
purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended October 31,
2003 and 2002 was as follows:

</Table>

    Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and
realized gains/losses under accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America and federal income tax purposes, permanent differences
between book and tax basis reporting have been identified and appropriately
reclassified on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Permanent book and tax
differences relating to expenses which are not deductible for tax purposes
totaling $2,349 were reclassified from accumulated undistributed net investment
income to paid in surplus. Additionally, permanent differences relating to book
and tax accretion differences totaling $67,622 have been reclassified from
accumulated undistributed net investment income to accumulated net realized
gain.

    As of October 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as follows:

its affiliates (collectively "Van Kampen"), the Trust's Administrator, at an
annual rate of .05% of the average daily net assets of the Trust. The
administrative services provided by the Administrator include record keeping and
reporting responsibilities with respect to the Trust's portfolio and preferred
shares and providing certain services to shareholders.

    For the year ended October 31, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $11,900 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher, & Flom (Illinois), counsel to the Trust, of which a trustee of
the Trust is an affiliated person.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the year ended October
31, 2003, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $30,000 representing
Van Kampen's cost of providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, which
are reported as part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively, in the
Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $35,995,158 and $39,229,219,
respectively.

4. PREFERRED SHARES

As of October 31, 2003, the Trust has outstanding 2,400 Auction Preferred Shares
("APS"). Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate is generally reset every
28 days through an auction process. The rate in effect on October 31, 2003 was
..950%. During the year ended October 31, 2003, the rates ranged from .700% to
1.70%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Van Kampen Trust for Investment
Grade New York Municipals:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of October 31, 2003, the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the four years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits. The Trust's financial highlights for
the periods ended prior to October 31, 2000, were audited by other auditors
whose report, dated December 6, 1999, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial highlights.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2003, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals as of October 31, 2003,
the results of its operations, the changes in its net assets and the financial
highlights for the respective stated periods, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which
Common Shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in Common Shares of the Trust. The Trust declares dividends out of
net investment income, and will distribute annually net realized capital gains,
if any. Common Shareholders may join or withdraw from the Plan at any time.

    If you decide to participate in the Plan, State Street Bank and Trust
Company, as your Plan Agent, will automatically invest your dividends and
capital gains distributions in Common Shares of the Trust for your account.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE

    If you wish to participate and your shares are held in your own name, call
1-800-341-2929 for more information and a Plan brochure. If your shares are held
in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you should contact your
nominee to see if it would participate in the Plan on your behalf. If you wish
to participate in the Plan, but your brokerage firm, bank or nominee is unable
to participate on your behalf, you should request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name which will enable your participation in the Plan.

HOW THE PLAN WORKS

    Participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in Common Shares valued
on the valuation date, generally at the lower of market price or net asset
value, except as specified below. The valuation date will be the dividend or
distribution payment date or, if that date is not a trading day on the national
securities exchange or market system on which the Common Shares are listed for
trading, the next preceding trading day. If the market price per Common Share on
the valuation date equals or exceeds net asset value per Common Share on that
date, the Trust will issue new Common Shares to participants valued at the
higher of net asset value or 95% of the market price on the valuation date. In
the foregoing situation, the Trust will not issue Common Shares under the Plan
below net asset value. If net asset value per Common Share on the valuation date
exceeds the market price per Common Share on that date, or if the Board of
Trustees should declare a dividend or capital gains distribution payable to the
Common Shareholders only in cash, participants in the Plan will be deemed to
have elected to receive Common Shares from the Trust valued at the market price
on that date. Accordingly, in this circumstance, the Plan Agent will, as agent
for the participants, buy the Trust's Common Shares in the open market for the
participants' accounts on or shortly after the payment date. If, before the Plan
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price exceeds the net asset value
per share of the Common Shares, the average per share purchase price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Trust's Common Shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer Common

 18
<PAGE>

Shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
issued by the Trust. All reinvestments are in full and fractional Common shares
and are carried to three decimal places.

    Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes are desirable.
Accordingly, the Trust reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as
applied to any dividend or distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to all Common Shareholders of the Trust at least 90 days before the
record date for the dividend or distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by the Plan Agent by at least 90 days written notice to all Common
Shareholders of the Trust.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    The Plan Agent's fees for the handling of the reinvestment of dividends and
distributions will be paid by the Trust. However, each participant will pay a
pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the Plan
Agent's open market purchases in connection with the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions. No other charges will be made to participants for reinvesting
dividends or capital gains distributions, except for certain brokerage
commissions, as described above.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    You will receive tax information annually for your personal records and to
help you prepare your federal income tax return. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions does not relieve you of any income tax
which may be payable on dividends or distributions.

RIGHT TO WITHDRAW

    Plan participants may withdraw at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or by
writing State Street Bank and Trust Company, P.O. Box 8200, Boston, MA
02266-8200. If you withdraw, you will receive, without charge, a share
certificate issued in your name for all full Common Shares credited to your
account under the Plan and a cash payment will be made for any fractional Common
Share credited to your account under the Plan. You may again elect to
participate in the Plan at any time by calling 1-800-341-2929 or writing to the
Trust at:

controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation.

reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                              ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003



I.       This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within
         the Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds"
         and each, a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer,
         President, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
         performing similar functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set
         forth in Exhibit B) for the purpose of promoting:

         o        honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
                  actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
                  professional relationships.

         o        full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                  reports and documents that a company files with, or submits
                  to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in
                  other public communications made by the Fund;

         o        compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                  regulations;

         o        prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
                  appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o        accountability for adherence to the Code.

                  Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of
business ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to
actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the
application of the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her
designee (who is set forth in Exhibit C).

II.      COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
         OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or
his service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.
<PAGE>
         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Fund.

         Each Covered Officer must not:

         o        use his personal influence or personal relationships
                  improperly to influence investment decisions or financial
                  reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would
                  benefit personally (directly or indirectly) to the detriment
                  of the Fund;

         o        cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
                  individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than
                  the benefit of the Fund; or

         o        use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
                  made or contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by,
                  the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
                  personally in contemplation of the market effect of such
                  transactions.

         Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to
the General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships
outside the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

         Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the
General Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any
activity or relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an
immediate member of the Covered Officer's family living in the same household
engages in such an activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these
include:

         o        service or significant business relationships as a director on
                  the board of any public or private company;

         o        accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including
                  gifts and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any
                  person or entity with which the Fund has current or
                  prospective business dealings, not including occasional
<PAGE>
                  meals or tickets for theatre or sporting events or other
                  similar entertainment; provided it is business-related,
                  reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not
                  so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

         o        any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                  relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other
                  than its investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any
                  affiliated person thereof; and

         o        a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                  transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
                  portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares
                  other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
                  employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o        Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with
                  the disclosure and compliance requirements generally
                  applicable to the Funds;

         o        each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
                  others to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others,
                  whether within or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's
                  Directors/Trustees and auditors, or to governmental regulators
                  and self-regulatory organizations;

         o        each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within
                  his area of responsibility, consult with other officers and
                  employees of the Funds and their investment advisers with the
                  goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                  understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
                  Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
                  communications made by the Funds; and

         o        it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
                  compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
                  applicable laws, rules and regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o        upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon
                  becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards
                  that he has received, read and understands the Code;

         o        annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied
                  with the requirements of the Code;

         o        not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer
                  or any employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for
                  reports of potential violations that are made in good faith;
                  and

         o        notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or
                  suspects of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is
                  itself a violation of this Code.

         The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any
<PAGE>
particular situation. However, any waivers(1) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

         The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

         o        the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to
                  investigate any potential violations reported to him;

         o        if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes
                  that no violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not
                  required to take any further action;

         o        any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation
                  will be reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

         o        if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are
                  not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company
                  Act (the "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
                  Partners") of the relevant Fund concur that a violation has
                  occurred, they will consider appropriate action, which may
                  include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
                  applicable policies and procedures; notification to
                  appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board;
                  or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other
                  appropriate disciplinary actions;

         o        the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners
                  of the relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers
                  of this Code, as appropriate; and

         o        any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent
                  required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other

     statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
     were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
     report;

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial

     presented in this report;

4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
     establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
     in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the

a)   designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure
     controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure
     that material information relating to the registrant, including its
     consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
     entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
     prepared;

[b)  Omitted.]

c)   evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
     procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
     effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date

     evaluation; and

d)   disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control
     over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent
     fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of
     an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
     materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
     reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
     operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
     likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
     summarize, and report financial information; and

b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
     employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal controls
     over financial reporting.
