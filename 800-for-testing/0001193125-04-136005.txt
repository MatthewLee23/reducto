R. Jay Gerken
R. JAY GERKEN, CFA
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Dear Shareholder,

We are pleased to inform you that the Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc. placed
fourth among 64 funds in its Lipper general municipal debt (leveraged)
closed-end funds category over the 12 months ended May 31, 2004./1/

During the past year, a pronounced pick-up/i/ in the pace of economic growth
from its sluggish state in early 2003 triggered a sea change in the bond
markets. The acceleration in the national economy also trickled down to a state
level to an extent. Even the U.S. labor market, which generated lackluster
results throughout much of the period, grew significantly during the past
several months by some measures./ii/

Although interest rates were on the decline earlier in the period, the shift in
interest rate perceptions triggered volatility in the bond markets and bond
yields spiraled upward, particularly toward the end of the period. However,
given that the fund's manager had anticipated that the U.S. economy could begin
to pick up, the manager maintained a more defensive posture in managing the
fund's exposure to interest rate sensitivity versus prior periods when rates
were declining. Although this approach detracted from the fund's performance
during times when bond prices rose, it diminished some of the

/1/Past performance is no guarantee of future results. A high Lipper ranking
   does not necessarily imply that a fund achieved positive results for the
   period. Rankings in the Lipper general municipal debt (leveraged) closed-end
   funds category are based on average annual total returns assuming the
   reinvestment of dividends and capital gains as of May 31, 2004. Each fund is
   ranked within a universe of funds similar in portfolio characteristics and
   capitalizations, as defined by Lipper, Inc. Rankings are based on
   performance that does not include sales charges. Performance results would
   have been less favorable had sales charges been included. The fund was
   ranked 4 out of 64, 42 out of 50, and 42 out of 46 for the 1-, 5-, and
   10-year periods, respectively.

downward pricing pressures on the portfolio when prices retreated and yields
rose, such as in April.

Please read on for a more detailed look at prevailing economic and market
conditions during the fund's fiscal year and to learn how the conditions and
changes made to the portfolio during that time may have affected fund
performance.

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests
and investigations.

In November 2003, Citigroup Asset Management disclosed an investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the U.S. Attorney relating to
Citigroup Asset Management's entry into the transfer agency business during
1997-1999. On July 20, 2004, Citigroup disclosed that it had been notified by
the Staff of the SEC that the Staff is considering recommending a civil
injunctive action and/or an administrative proceeding against certain advisory
and transfer agent entities affiliated with Citigroup relating to the creation
and operation of its internal transfer agent unit to serve primarily the Smith
Barney family of mutual funds. This internal transfer agent did not provide
services to the Fund. Citigroup is cooperating with the SEC and will seek to
resolve this matter in discussion with the SEC Staff. Although there can be no
assurance, Citigroup does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect on the fund.

As always, thank you for your confidence in our stewardship of your assets. We
look forward to helping you continue to meet your financial goals.

Sincerely,
/s/ R. Jay Gerken

Performance Review
During the 12 months ended May 31, 2004, the fund returned 5.86% based on its
New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") market price and 5.63% based on its net asset
value ("NAV")/iii/ per share. In comparison, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index/iv/ returned -0.03% over the same period. Based on NAV performance, the
fund's Lipper general municipal debt (leveraged) closed-end funds category
average was 0.64%

and the fund ranked fourth among the 64 funds in its Lipper category over this
same time frame. Please note that Lipper performance returns are based on each
fund's NAV.

During the 12-month period, the fund distributed dividends to shareholders
totaling $0.70 per share. The performance table shows the fund's 30-day SEC and
annualized distribution yields as well as its 12-month total return based on
its NAV and market price as of May 31, 2004.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The fund's yields will
vary. Certain investors may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax,

  All figures represent past performance and are not a guarantee of future
  results. The fund's yields will vary.

  Total returns are based on changes in NAV or market price, respectively.
  Total returns assume the reinvestment of all dividends and/or capital gains
  distributions, if any, in additional shares. Annualized distribution yield is
  the fund's current monthly income dividend rate, annualized, and then divided
  by the NAV or the market price noted in this report. The "SEC yield" is a
  return figure often quoted by bond and other fixed income mutual funds. This
  quotation is based on the most recent 30-day (or one month) period covered by
  the fund's filings with the SEC. The yield figure reflects the dividends and
  interest earned during the period after deduction of the fund's expenses for
  the period. The annualized distribution yield assumes a current monthly
  income dividend rate of $0.058 for 12 months. These yields are as of May 31,
  2004, and are subject to change.

Market Snapshot
The interest rate environment experienced an about-face over the past year. The
municipal bond markets got off to a relatively strong start last spring as the
economy was still in a relatively sluggish state and interest rates were still
declining. To help boost economic activity, in June 2003 the Fed reduced its
target for the federal funds rate, which dropped to four-decade lows. However,
bond prices retreated through the early summer following comments from the Fed
about its monetary policy and data suggesting a pick-up in economic activity.
Although this led to concerns about rising interest rates, as bond prices move
opposite to anticipated interest rate movements, inflation remained benign.
When the summer came to a close, the broader bond markets stabilized and bonds
traded in a fairly narrower range in the fall versus the summer.

In terms of the national economy, annual growth of real gross domestic
product/v/ rose over the period versus levels in early 2003. In 2004, comments
from the Fed about the improvement in the economy, coupled with stronger
reports on job growth late in the period and a pick-up in inflation, generated
more pronounced concerns about interest rates. As a result, bond prices pulled
back significantly, particularly toward the end of the first and during the
second calendar quarters. Although municipal bond prices fluctuated in May,
they held up better than during March and April./vi/

Factors Influencing Fund Performance
Given that we anticipated that the economy would improve, and eventually lead
to rising bond yields and pressure on bond prices, we took a more cautious
stance in terms of the fund's exposure to interest rate risk than we had in
past years when the Fed was in the middle of its rate-cutting cycle. We
shortened overall duration, which can help cushion the portfolio from the bond
price declines that typically accompany rising interest rates. The fund
maintained an emphasis on longer-term, premium-priced higher-coupon callable
bonds and continued to hold a short position in U.S. Treasury futures to help
hedge the portfolio against some of the effects of a potential rise in interest
rates. Although our conservative approach at times limited the fund's full
participation in market rallies, it helped reduce the negative impact on the
fund during times when bond prices declined, such as during April.

The fund's assets were concentrated in revenue bonds, which are backed by
revenue streams of specific public works. In general, given their yields during
the period, we favored revenue bonds to many comparable-maturity state-backed
general obligation bonds on a risk/reward basis. Rather than target specific
industries, however, we invested in bonds that we felt offered better overall
relative values after taking into account their yields in accordance with their
credit risk.

In the current environment, given the likelihood that interest rates will rise,
we continue to believe that the best offense is a good defense. Therefore, we
will continue to maintain a defensive posture with regard to interest rate and
credit risk.

RISKS: Fixed-income investments are subject to interest rate risk. As interest
rates rise, the price of fixed-income investments decline. Please note that
derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid and harder to value,
especially in declining markets. A small investment in certain derivatives may
have a potentially large impact on the fund's performance. Derivatives can
disproportionately increase losses as stated in the prospectus.

Take Advantage of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan!
As an investor in the Fund, you can participate in its Dividend Reinvestment
Plan ("Plan"), a convenient, simple and efficient way to reinvest your
dividends and capital gains, if any, in additional shares of the Fund. Below is
a short summary of how the Plan works.

Plan Summary
If you are a Plan participant who has not elected to receive your dividends in
the form of a cash payment, then your dividend and capital gain distributions
will be reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Fund.

The number of shares of common stock of the Fund that you will receive in lieu
of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. If the market price
of the common stock is equal to or exceeds 98% of the net asset value per share
("NAV") on the determination date, you will be issued shares by the Fund at a
price reflecting 98% of NAV, or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.

If the market price is less than 98% of the NAV at the time of valuation (the
close of business on the determination date), PFPC Inc. ("Plan Agent"), will
buy common stock for your account in the open market.

If the Plan Agent begins to purchase additional shares in the open market and
the market price of the shares subsequently rises above the previously
determined NAV before the purchases are completed, the Plan Agent will attempt
to terminate purchases and have the Fund issue the remaining dividend or
distribution in shares at the greater of the previously determined 98% of NAV
or 95% of the market price. In that case, the number of Fund shares you receive
will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in
the open market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares.

A more complete description of the current Plan appears in this report
beginning on page 44.

To find more detailed information about the Plan and about how you can
participate, please call the Plan Agent at 1 (800) 331-1710.

                                  (unaudited)



The definitions of the applicable rating symbols are set forth below:

Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("Standard & Poor's") -- Ratings from "AA" to
"CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show
relative standings within the major rating categories.

<TABLE>
<C>    <S>
AAA    --Bonds rated "AAA" have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
         Poor's. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely
         strong.
AA     --Bonds rated "AA" have a very strong capacity to pay interest and
         repay principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in a
         small degree.
A      --Bonds rated "A" have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
         principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the
         adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions
         than debt in higher rated categories.
BBB    --Bonds rated "BBB" are regarded as having an adequate capacity to
         pay interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit
         adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or
         changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
         capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this
         category than in higher rated categories.
BB, B, --Bonds rated "BB", "B", "CCC" and "CC" are regarded, on balance, as
CCC      predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest
and CC   and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation.
         "BB" represents a lower degree of speculation than "B", and "CC"
         the highest degree of speculation. While such bonds will likely
         have some quality and protective characteristics, these are
         outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to
         adverse conditions.

Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") -- Numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 may
be applied to eachgeneric rating from "Aa" to "Ba," where 1 is the highest
and 3 the lowest ranking within itsgeneric category.
Aaa    --Bonds rated "Aaa" are judged to be of the best quality. They carry
         the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred
         to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by
         an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the
         various protective elements are likely to change, such changes as
         can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally
         strong position of such issues.
Aa     --Bonds rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
         Together with the "Aaa" group they comprise what are generally
         known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds
         because margins of protection may not be as large in "Aaa"
         securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater
         amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the
         long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in "Aaa" securities.
A      --Bonds rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes and
         are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors
         giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate
         but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to
         impairment some time in the future.
Baa    --Bonds rated "Baa" are considered as medium grade obligations, i.e.,
         they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest
         payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but
         certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
         characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such
         bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have
         speculative characteristics as well.
Ba     --Bonds rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their
         future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection
         of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and
         therefore not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over
         the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this
         class.

NR     --Indicates that the bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's or
         Moody's.

   1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc. ("Fund"), a Maryland corporation, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.

   The following are significant accounting policies consistently followed by
the Fund and are in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"): (a) security transactions are accounted for on trade date;
(b) securities are valued at the mean between bid and asked prices provided by
an independent pricing service that are based on transactions in municipal
obligations, quotations from municipal bond dealers, market transactions in
comparable securities and various relationships between securities; (c)
securities for which market quotations are not available will be valued in good
faith at fair value by or under the direction of the Board of Directors; (d)
securities maturing within 60 days or less are valued at cost plus accreted
discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates value; (e) gains or
losses on the sale of securities are calculated by using the specific
identification method; (f) interest income, adjusted for amortization of
premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual basis; (g)
dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded monthly by the Fund on
the ex-dividend date for the shareholders of Common Stock. The holders of the
Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends
in accordance with an auction that will normally be held weekly and out of
funds legally available to shareholders; (h) the net asset value of the Fund's
Common Stock is determined no less frequently than the close of business on the
Fund's last business day of each week (generally Friday). It is determined by
dividing the value of the net assets available to Common Stock by the total
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. For the purpose of determining
the net asset value per share of the Common Stock, the value of the Fund's net
assets shall be deemed to equal the value of the Fund's assets less (1) the
Fund's liabilities, (2) the aggregate liquidation value (i.e., $25,000 per
outstanding share) of the Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock and (3)
accumulated and unpaid dividends on the outstanding Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock issue; (i) the Fund intends to comply with the applicable
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pertaining to
regulated investment companies and to make distributions of taxable income
sufficient to relieve it from substantially all Federal income and excise
taxes; (j) the character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in
accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from GAAP. At May 31,

available for distributions under income tax regulations; and (k) estimates and
assumptions are required to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes
in net assets resulting from operations when financial statements are prepared.
Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters
used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.

   2. EXEMPT-INTEREST DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

   The Fund intends to satisfy conditions that will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular Federal income tax and from
designated state income taxes, to retain such tax-exempt status when
distributed to the shareholders of the Fund.

   Capital gain distributions, if any, are taxable to shareholders, and are
declared and paid at least annually.

   3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT AND OTHER
      TRANSACTIONS

   Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("SBFM"), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as the investment adviser and
administrator to the Fund. For investment advisory and administrative services,
the Fund pays SBFM fees calculated at the annual rate of 0.70% and 0.20% of the
average daily total net assets of the Fund, respectively, for an aggregate
investment advisory and administrative fee of 0.90%. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, by agreement between SBFM and the Fund, the Fund pays SBFM an
aggregate investment advisory and administrative fee at an annual rate of 0.65%
on those assets of the Fund equal to the product of the number of preferred
shares outstanding multiplied by the liquidation value of such shares. The
investment advisory fee and the administrative fee are each calculated daily
and paid monthly.

   Effective September 1, 2003, the aggregate investment advisory and
administrative fee rate of 0.90% described above was reduced to an aggregate
fee of 0.75%, composed of investment advisory and administrative fees
calculated at the annual rate of 0.55% and 0.20% of the average daily total net
assets of the Fund, respectively. The investment advisory and administrative
fees are otherwise calculated as described in the above paragraph.

   All officers and one Director of the Fund are employees of Citigroup or its
affiliates.

   4. INVESTMENTS

   During the year ended May 31, 2004, the aggregate cost of purchases
and proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purchases                                                         $234,529,245

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   At May 31, 2004, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation of investments for Federal income tax purposes were as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gross unrealized appreciation                                     $ 28,506,222
Gross unrealized depreciation                                      (24,274,910)

Net unrealized appreciation                                       $  4,231,312
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5. FUTURES CONTRACTS

   Securities or cash equal to the initial margin amount are either deposited
with the broker or segregated by the custodian upon entering into the futures
contract. Additional securities are also segregated up to the current market
value of the futures contract. During the period the futures contract is open,
changes in the value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or
losses by "marking-to-market" on a daily basis to reflect the market value of
the contract at the end of each day's trading. Variation margin payments are
received or made and recognized as assets due from or liabilities due to
broker, depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. When
the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the
difference between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transactions and
the Fund's basis in the contract. The Fund enters into such contracts typically
to hedge a portion of its portfolio. The Fund bears the market risk that arises
from changes in the value of the financial instruments and securities indices.

   At May 31, 2004, the Fund had the following open futures contracts:

                   Number of               Basis        Market    Unrealized

   6. AUCTION RATE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

   As of May 31, 2004, the Fund had 2,000 outstanding shares of Series M,
Series T, Series W, Series Th and Series F, respectively, of Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock ("ARCPS"). The ARCPS' dividends are cumulative at a
rate determined at an auction and the dividend period is typically 7 days. The
dividend rates ranged from 0.60% to 1.25% during the year ended May 31, 2004.
At May 31, 2004, the dividend rates were as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                               Series M Series T Series W Series Th Series F
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
<S>                            <C>      <C>      <C>      <C>       <C>
Dividend Rates                  1.08%    1.05%    1.05%     1.05%    1.05%
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

   The ARCPS are redeemable under certain conditions by the Fund, or subject to
mandatory redemption (if the Fund is in default of certain coverage
requirements) at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference, which
is the sum of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

   The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverages with respect to the
ARCPS. If the Fund fails to maintain these coverages and does not cure any such
failure within the required time period, the Fund is required to redeem a
requisite number of the ARCPS in order to meet the applicable requirement.
Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing asset requirements would restrict
the Fund's ability to pay dividends to common stock shareholders.

   Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM"), another indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citigroup, currently acts as a broker/dealer in connection with
the auction of ARCPS. After each auction, the auction agent will pay to each
participating broker/dealer, from monies the Fund provides, a participation fee
at the annual rate of 0.25% of the purchase price of the ARCPS that the
broker/dealer places at the auction. For the year ended May 31, 2004, the Fund
incurred auction participation fees of $627,103 for CGM's services as a
participating broker/dealer.

   7. CAPITAL SHARES

   Capital stock transactions were as follows:

   8. CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARD

   At May 31, 2004, the Fund had, for Federal income tax purposes,
approximately $21,156,000 of unused capital loss carryforwards available to
offset future capital gains. To the extent that these carryforward losses are
used to offset capital gains, it is probable that the gains so offset will not
be distributed. The amount and year of expiration for each carryforward loss is
indicated below. Expiration occurs on May 31 of the year indicated:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                          2008        2011

                  --------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

   In addition, the Fund had $1,461,142 of capital losses realized after
October 31, 2003, which were deferred for income purposes to the first day of
the following fiscal year.

   9. INCOME TAX INFORMATION AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

   At May 31, 2004, the tax basis components of distributable earnings were:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                 ---------------------------------------------
                 <S>                             <C>
                 Undistributed tax-exempt income $  1,096,751
                 ---------------------------------------------
                 Accumulated capital losses       (21,156,474)
                 ---------------------------------------------
                 Unrealized appreciation            4,231,312
                 ---------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

   The difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized appreciation and
depreciation is attributable primarily to mark to market of derivative
contracts and the treatment of accretion of discounts and amortization of
premiums.

   The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended May 31, was:

   10.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   Citigroup has been notified by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") that the Staff is considering recommending a civil
injunctive action and/or an administrative proceeding against Citigroup Asset
Management ("CAM"), including its applicable investment advisory companies and
Citicorp Trust Bank ("CTB"), an internal transfer agent, relating to the
creation and operation of the internal transfer agent unit to serve certain
CAM-managed funds. CTB did not provide services to the Fund. This notification
arises out of a previously disclosed investigation by the SEC and the U.S.
Attorney and relates to CTB's entry in 1999 into the transfer agency business,
CAM's retention of, and agreements with an unaffiliated sub-transfer agent, the
adequacy of the disclosures made to the fund boards that approved the transfer
agency arrangements, (including CAM's failure to disclose a related revenue
guarantee agreement benefiting CAM and its affiliates), and CAM's operation of
and compensation for the transfer agency business. The revenue guarantee
described above was terminated in 1999 and CAM will be paying the applicable
funds, primarily through fee waivers, a total of approximately $17 million
(plus interest) that is the amount of the revenue received by Citigroup
relating to the revenue guarantee. Citigroup is cooperating fully in the
investigation and will seek to resolve the matter in discussions with the SEC
Staff. Although there can be no assurance, Citigroup does not believe that this
matter will have a material adverse effect on the Fund.

(2)Effective June 1, 2001, the Fund adopted a change in accounting method that
   requires the Fund to amortize premiums and accrete all discounts. Without
   the adoption of this change, for the year ended May 31, 2002, the ratio of
   net investment income to average net assets would have been 4.81%. Per share
   information, ratios and supplemental data for the periods prior to June 1,

   accordance with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Performance figures
   may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Past performance is
   no guarantee of future results. In the absence of fee waivers and/or expense
   reimbursements, the total return would be reduced.

   Preferred Stock at $25,000 a share, for Series M, Series T, Series W, Series
   Th and Series F, respectively.
(6)Excludes accumulated undeclared dividends.

year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the years
in the two-year period then ended and financial highlights for each of the
years in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

   We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of May 31, 2004, by correspondence
with the custodian or broker. As to securities purchased or sold but not yet
received or delivered, we performed other appropriate auditing procedures. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

   In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
the Fund as of May 31, 2004, and the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the two-year
period then ended and financial highlights for each of the years in the
five-year period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

                                TAX INFORMATION
                                  (unaudited)

   For the year ended May 31, 2004, 99.99% of the dividends paid by the Fund
from net investment income were tax exempt for regular Federal income tax
purposes.

                          DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
                                  (unaudited)


   Under the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), a shareholder whose
shares of common stock are registered in his own name will have all
distributions from the Fund reinvested automatically by PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), as
purchasing agent under the Plan, unless the shareholder elects to receive cash.
Distributions with respect to shares registered in the name of a broker-dealer
or other nominee (that is, in street name) will be reinvested by the broker or
nominee in additional shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided
by the broker or nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in
cash. Investors who own common stock registered in street name should consult
their broker-dealers for details regarding reinvestment. All distributions to
shareholders who do not participate in the Plan will be paid by check mailed
directly to the record holder by or under the direction of PFPC as dividend
paying agent.

   The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the Plan
in lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. When the
market price of the common stock is equal to or exceeds 98% of the net asset
value per share of the common stock on the determination date (generally, the
record date for the distribution), Plan participants will be issued shares of
common stock by the Fund at a price equal to the greater of 98% of net asset
value or 95% of the market price of the common stock.

   If the market price of the common stock is less than 98% of the net asset
value of the common stock at the time of valuation (which is the close of
business on the determination date), PFPC will buy common stock in the open
market, on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. If following
the commencement of the purchases and before PFPC has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of the common stock as of the
valuation time, PFPC will attempt to terminate purchases in the open market and
cause the Fund to issue the remaining portion of the dividend or distribution
in shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) 98% of net asset value as of
the valuation time or (b) 95% of the then current market price. In this case,
the number of shares received by a Plan participant will be based on the
weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the open market and the
price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares. To the extent PFPC is
unable to stop open market purchases and cause the Fund to issue the remaining
shares, the average per share purchase price paid by PFPC may exceed the net
asset value of the common stock as of the valuation time, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or capital gains distribution
had been paid in common stock issued by the Fund at such net asset value. PFPC
will begin to purchase common stock on the open market as

                          DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
                            (unaudited) (continued)


soon as practicable after the determination date for the dividend or capital
gains distribution, but in no event shall such purchases continue later than 30
days after the payment date for such dividend or distribution, or the record
date for a succeeding dividend or distribution, except when necessary to comply
with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.

   PFPC maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmations of all transactions in each account, including information needed
by a shareholder for personal and tax records. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will not relieve Plan participants of
any income tax that may be payable on the dividends or capital gains
distributions. Common stock in the account of each Plan participant will be
held by PFPC in uncertificated form in the name of the Plan participant.

   Plan participants are subject to no charge for reinvesting dividends and
capital gains distributions under the Plan. PFPC's fees for handling the
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions will be paid by the
Fund. No brokerage charges apply with respect to shares of common stock issued
directly by the Fund under the Plan. Each Plan participant will, however, bear
a proportionate share of any brokerage commissions actually incurred with
respect to any open market purchases made under the Plan.

   Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes to it are desirable. The
Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by PFPC, with the Fund's prior written consent, on at least 30 days'
written notice to Plan participants. All correspondence concerning the plan
should be directed by mail to PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 43027, Providence, Rhode
Island 02940-3027 or by telephone at 1 (800) 331-1710.

   Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, that from time to time the Fund may purchase
shares of its common stock in the open market.

          (e)  (1) Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
               described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

          The Charter for the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of
          each registered investment company (the "Fund") advised by Smith
          Barney Fund Management LLC or Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc
          or one of their affiliates (each, an "Adviser") requires that the
          Committee shall approve (a) all audit and permissible non-audit
          services to be provided to the Fund and (b) all permissible non-audit
          services to be provided by the Fund's independent auditors to the
          Adviser and any Covered Service Providers if the engagement relates
          directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. The
          Committee may implement policies and procedures by which such services
          are approved other than by the full Committee.

          The Committee shall not approve non-audit services that the Committee
          believes may impair the independence of the auditors. As of the date
          of the approval of this Audit Committee Charter, permissible non-audit
          services include any professional services (including tax services),
          that are not prohibited services as described below, provided to the
          Fund by the independent auditors, other than those provided to the
          Fund in connection with an audit or a review of the financial
          statements of the Fund. Permissible non-audit services may not
          include: (i) bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting
          records or financial statements of the Fund; (ii) financial
          information systems design and implementation; (iii) appraisal or
          valuation services, fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports;
          (iv) actuarial services; (v) internal audit outsourcing services; (vi)
          management functions or human resources; (vii) broker or dealer,
          investment adviser or investment banking services; (viii) legal
          services and expert services unrelated to the audit; and (ix) any
          other service the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
          determines, by regulation, is impermissible.

          Pre-approval by the Committee of any permissible non-audit services is
          not required so long as: (i) the aggregate amount of all such
          permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund, the Adviser and
          any service providers controlling, controlled by or under common
          control with the Adviser that provide ongoing services to the Fund
          ("Covered Service Providers") constitutes not more than 5% of the
          total amount of revenues paid to the independent auditors during the
          fiscal year in which the permissible non-audit services are provided

<PAGE>

          to (a) the Fund, (b) the Adviser and (c) any entity controlling,
          controlled by or under common control with the Adviser that provides
          ongoing services to the Fund during the fiscal year in which the
          services are provided that would have to be approved by the Committee;
          (ii) the permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the
          Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii)
          such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Committee
          and approved by the Committee (or its delegate(s)) prior to the
          completion of the audit.

          (f)  N/A

          (g)  Non-audit fees billed by the Accountant for services rendered to
               Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc. and CAM and any entity
               controlling, controlled by, or under common control with CAM that
               provides ongoing services to Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc.
               were $0 and $0 for the years ended 5/31/04 and 5/31/03.

          (h)  Yes. The Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc.'s Audit Committee has
               considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were
               rendered to Service Affiliates which were not pre-approved (not
               requiring pre-approval) is compatible with maintaining the
               Accountant's independence. All services provided by the
               Accountant to the Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc. or to Service
               Affiliates which were required to be pre-approved were
               pre-approved as required.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

        Not applicable.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

        The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to
        develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to the Manager.
        The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management ("CAM"), a group of
        investment adviser affiliates of Citigroup, Inc. ("Citigroup"). Along
        with the other investment advisers that comprise CAM, the Manager has
        adopted a set of proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies")
        to ensure that the Manager votes proxies relating to equity securities
        in the best interest of clients.

        In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary principles
        and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best interest of clients.
        The Manager attempts to consider all factors that could affect the value
        of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner that it believes
        will be consistent with efforts to maximize shareholder values. The
        Manager may utilize an external service provider to provide it with
        information and/or a recommendation with regard to proxy votes. However,
        such recommendations do not relieve the Manager of its responsibility
        for the proxy vote.

        In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated position in the
        Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with such stated position.
        In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a list of factors set
        forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such issue, CAM
        votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general principles
        set forth above and considering such enumerated

<PAGE>

        factors. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated
        position or list of factors that CAM considers in voting on such issue,
        CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general
        principles set forth above. Issues for which there is a stated position
        set forth in the Policies or for which there is a list of factors set
        forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such issues fall
        into a variety of categories, including election of directors,
        ratification of auditors, proxy and tender offer defenses, capital
        structure issues, executive and director compensation, mergers and
        corporate restructurings, and social and environmental issues. The
        stated position on an issue set forth in the Policies can always be
        superseded, subject to the duty to act solely in the best interest of
        the beneficial owners of accounts, by the investment management
        professionals responsible for the account whose shares are being voted.
        Issues applicable to a particular industry may cause CAM to abandon a
        policy that would have otherwise applied to issuers generally. As a
        result of the independent investment advisory services provided by
        distinct CAM business units, there may be occasions when different
        business units or different portfolio managers within the same business
        unit vote differently on the same issue.

        In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
        interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to identify
        and address material conflicts that may arise between the Manager's
        interests and those of its clients before voting proxies on behalf of
        such clients. To seek to identify conflicts of interest, CAM
        periodically notifies CAM employees (including employees of the Manager)
        in writing that they are under an obligation (i) to be aware of the
        potential for conflicts of interest with respect to voting proxies on
        behalf of client accounts both as a result of their personal
        relationships and due to special circumstances that may arise during the
        conduct of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to bring conflicts
        of interest of which they become aware to the attention of compliance
        personnel. The Manager also maintains and considers a list of
        significant relationships that could present a conflict of interest for
        the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is also sensitive to the fact
        that a significant, publicized relationship between an issuer and a
        non-CAM affiliate might appear to the public to influence the manner in
        which the Manager decides to vote a proxy with respect to such issuer.
        Absent special circumstances or a significant, publicized non-CAM
        affiliate relationship that CAM or the Manager for prudential reasons
        treats as a potential conflict of interest because such relationship
        might appear to the public to influence the manner in which the Manager
        decides to vote a proxy, the Manager generally takes the position that
        non-CAM relationships between Citigroup and an issuer (e.g. investment
        banking or banking) do not present a conflict of interest for the
        Manager in voting proxies with respect to such issuer. Such position is
        based on the fact that the Manager is operated as an independent
        business unit from other Citigroup business units as well as on the
        existence of information barriers between the Manager and certain other
        Citigroup business units.

        CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager personnel
        are members, to review and address conflicts of interest

<PAGE>

        brought to its attention by compliance personnel. A proxy issue that
        will be voted in accordance with a stated position on an issue or in
        accordance with the recommendation of an independent third party is not
        brought to the attention of the Proxy Voting Committee for a conflict of
        interest review because the Manager's position is that to the extent a
        conflict of interest issue exists, it is resolved by voting in
        accordance with a pre-determined policy or in accordance with the
        recommendation of an independent third party. With respect to a conflict
        of interest brought to its attention, the Proxy Voting Committee first
        determines whether such conflict of interest is material. A conflict of
        interest is considered material to the extent that it is determined that
        such conflict is likely to influence, or appear to influence, the
        Manager's decision-making in voting proxies. If it is determined by the
        Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of interest is not material, the
        Manager may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.

        If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of
        interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for
        determining an appropriate method to resolve such conflict of interest
        before the proxy affected by the conflict of interest is voted. Such
        determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances,
        including the importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the
        conflict of interest. Methods of resolving a material conflict of
        interest may include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict to
        clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting to
        clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on their
        behalf.

                        SARBANES-OXLEY ACT CODE OF ETHICS
                           FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
           SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF CAM/U.S. REGISTERED INVESTMENT
                                   COMPANIES

I.      Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

        This code of ethics (the "Code") for Citigroup Asset Management's
("CAM's") U. S. registered proprietary investment companies (collectively,
"Funds" and each a, "Company") applies to each Company's Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller
(the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

    .   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
        apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
        relationships;

    .   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
        and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
        and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
        by the Company;

    .   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

    .   the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
        appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

    .   accountability for adherence to the Code.

    Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.     Administration of Code

        The Regional Director of CAM Compliance, North America ("Compliance
Officer") is responsible for administration of this Code, including granting
pre-approvals (see Section III below) and waivers (as described in Section VI
below), applying this Code in specific situations in which questions are
presented under it and interpreting this Code in any particular situation.

<PAGE>

III.    COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD ETHICALLY HANDLE ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
        OF INTEREST

        Overview. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
his position with the Company.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company because
of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The compliance programs
and procedures of the Company and its investment adviser are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code (see Section VII
below).

        Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are
also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for a
Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies
and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and a
Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the adviser and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of a Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Funds' Boards of Directors\Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may
also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered
by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

             .                .                 .                 .

        Each Covered Officer must:

    .   not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
        influence investment decisions or financial reporting ( e.g. through
        fraudulent accounting

<PAGE>

        practices) by the Company whereby the Covered Officer1 would benefit
        personally to the detriment of the Company; or

    .   not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
        individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than for the
        benefit of the Company; and

    .   not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
        contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others to
        trade personally in contemplation of the market affect of such
        transactions.

    .   There are some potential conflict of interest situations that should
        always be discussed with the Compliance Officer, if material. Examples
        are as follows:

                (1) service as a director on the board of any public or private
        company;

                (2) any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
        relationship with, any of the Company's service providers, other than
        its investment adviser,

                (3) a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
        transaction charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting
        portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
        interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
        compensation or equity ownership; and

                (4) the receipt of any gifts or the conveyance of any value
        (including entertainment ) from any company with which the Company has
        current or prospective business dealings, except:

                        (a) any non-cash gifts of nominal value (nominal value
                is less than $100); and

                        (b) customary and reasonable meals and entertainment at
                which the giver is present, such as the occasional business meal
                or sporting event.

IV.     Disclosure and Compliance

Each Covered Officer:

    .   should be familiar with his or her responsibilities in connection with
        the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company;

/1/ Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
    Officer would also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of
    a Covered Officer's family (spouse, minor children and any account over
    which a Covered Officer is deemed to have beneficial interest) engages in
    such an activity or has such a relationship.

<PAGE>

    .   should not knowingly misrepresent, or knowingly cause others to
        misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or
        outside the Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors,
        and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

    .   should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
        responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds
        and the investment adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
        accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
        documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
        communications made by the Funds; and

    .   is responsible to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions
        imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.      Reporting and Accountability

        Each Covered Officer must:

    .   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
        Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that the Covered
        Officer has received, read, and understands the Code;

    .   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied with
        the requirements of the Code;

    .   annually disclose affiliations and other relationships related to
        conflicts of interest;

    .   not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
        Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
        that are made in good faith; and

    .   notify the Compliance Officer promptly if he knows of any violation of
        this Code (failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code).

        In rendering decisions and interpretations and in conducting
investigations of potential violations under the Code, the Compliance Officer
may, at his discretion, consult with such persons as he determines to be
appropriate, including, but not limited to, a senior legal officer of the
Company or its investment adviser or its affiliates, independent auditors or
other consultants, subject to any requirement to seek pre-approval from the
Company's audit committee for the retention of independent auditors to perform
permissible non-audit services. The Funds will follow these procedures in
investigating and enforcing the Code:

    .   the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
        any potential violation of which he becomes aware;

    .   if, after investigation the Compliance Officer believes that no
        violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take
        any further action;

<PAGE>

    .   any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
        reported to the Directors of the Fund who are not "interested persons"
        as defined in the Investment Company Act the ("Non-interested
        Directors")

    .   if the Non-interested Directors of the Board concur that a violation has
        occurred, it will consider appropriate action, which may include review
        of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and
        procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
        adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered
        Officer; and

    .   any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
        disclosed as provided by SEC rules

    The Compliance Officer shall submit an annual report to the Board describing
any waivers granted.

VI.     Waivers2

        A Covered Officer may request a waiver of any of the provisions of the
Code by submitting a written request for such waiver to the Compliance Officer,
setting forth the basis of such request and explaining how the waiver would be
consistent with the standards of conduct described herein. The Compliance
Officer shall review such request and make a determination thereon in writing,
which shall be binding.

        In determining whether to waive any provisions of this Code, the
Compliance Officer shall consider whether the proposed waiver is consistent with
honest and ethical conduct and other purposes of this Code.

VII.    Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code. The codes of ethics of the funds and the
investment advisers and principal underwriters under Rule 17j-1 of the
Investment Company Act and the Citigroup Code of Conduct and Citigroup Statement
of Business Practices as well as other policies of the Fund's investment
advisers or their affiliates are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

/2/ For purposes of this Code, Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the
    approval by a Company of a material departure from a provision of the Code"
    and includes an "implicit waiver," which means a Company's failure to take
    action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure
    from a provision of the Code that has been made known to an executive
    officer of the Company.

<PAGE>

VIII.   Amendments

        Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B and
C must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a
majority of Non-interested Directors.

IX.     Confidentiality

        All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board and Company
and their respective counsel, counsel to the non-Interested Directors or
independent auditors or other consultants referred to in Section V above.

X.      Internal Use

        The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

        over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
        recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year in the
        case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably
        likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over
        financial reporting; and

5.  The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
    registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
    directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

    a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
        operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
        reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
        record, process, summarize, and report financial data; and

    b)  Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
        employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting.
