ITEM 1. REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.
                                                                [LOGO OMITTED]

                                                                UTILITY TRUST

                         THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST INC.

                               Semi-Annual Report
                                  June 30, 2003
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,

      We are  changing  the way we provide  portfolio  managers'  commentary  to
shareholders  of our Funds.  Our  shareholder  reports have typically  contained
commentary  on  each  portfolio  manager's   assessment  of  the  stock  market,
individual  stocks and how economic  events affect their  thinking in managing a
specific Fund. We have always provided  details about  performance and presented
returns,  both good and bad,  hopefully  in a clear and concise  fashion.  These
comments have been included as part of each Fund's quarterly,  semi-annual,  and
annual financial statements.

      The Sarbanes-Oxley Act's new corporate governance  regulations now require
a Fund's  principal  executive  and  financial  officers  to certify  the entire
contents of  shareholder  reports in a filing with the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission on form N-CSR.  This  certification  covers the  portfolio  manager's
commentary  and  subjective  opinions  if they are  attached to or a part of the
financial statements.

      Rather than ask our portfolio  managers to eliminate their opinions and/or
restrict  their  commentary  to  historical  facts only,  we are removing  their
commentary from the financial statements and sending it to you separately.  As a
result,  this commentary will no longer be considered part of a Fund's financial
report and therefore will not be subject to the officers' certifications.

      We  trust  that  you  understand   that  our  approach  is  an  unintended
consequence of the  ever-increasing  regulatory  requirements  affecting  public
companies generally.  We hope the specific  certification  requirements of these
new  regulations  will be  modified  as  they  relate  to  mutual  funds,  since
investment  companies have different  corporate  structures and objectives  than
other public companies.

                                                    Sincerely yours,


                                                    /S/ BRUCE N. ALPERT

                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
                    NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.  ORGANIZATION.   The  Gabelli  Utility  Trust  (the  "Utility  Trust")  is  a
closed-end,   non-diversified  management  investment  company  organized  as  a
Delaware business trust on February 25, 1999 and registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940,  as amended (the "1940 Act"),  whose  primary  objective is
long-term  growth of capital and income.  The  Utility  Trust had no  operations
prior to July 9,  1999,  other  than the sale of  10,000  shares  of  beneficial
interest for $100,000 to The Gabelli  Equity Trust Inc. (the "Equity  Trust") at
$10.00 per share.  On July 9, 1999,  the Utility Trust had a 4 for 3 stock split
making the balance of Utility  Trust  shares held by the Equity Trust as 13,333.
On July 9, 1999, the Equity Trust contributed $79,487,260 in cash and securities
in exchange for shares of the Utility  Trust,  and on the same date  distributed
such shares to Equity Trust  shareholders  of record on July 1, 1999 at the rate
of one  share of the  Utility Trust for every  ten  shares  of the Equity Trust.
Investment operations commenced on July 9, 1999.

Effective  August 1, 2002,  the Fund  modified  its  non-fundamental  investment
policy to  increase,  from 65% to 80%,  the  portion of its assets  that it will
invest, under normal market conditions, in common stocks and other securities of
foreign and  domestic  companies  involved in  providing  products,  services or
equipment for (i) the generation or distribution  of electricity,  gas and water
and (ii)  telecommunications  services or  infrastructure  operations  (the "80%
Policy").

The 80% Policy may be changed without shareholder  approval.  However,  the Fund
has adopted a policy to provide  shareholders  with at least 60 days'  notice of
the implementation of any change in the 80% Policy.

2. SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported amounts and disclosures
in the financial  statements.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Utility Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.

     SECURITY VALUATION.  Portfolio  securities listed or traded on a nationally
recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter market for
which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale
price or a market's  official  closing  price as of the close of business on the
day the  securities  are being  valued.  If there  were no sales  that day,  the
security is valued at the  average of the  closing  bid and asked  prices or, if
there were no asked  prices  quoted on that day,  then the security is valued at
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked  prices are quoted on such
day,  the  security is valued at the most  recently  available  price or, if the
Board of Trustees so  determines,  by such other method as the Board of Trustees
shall  determine  in good faith,  to reflect its fair  market  value.  Portfolio
securities  traded on more than one national  securities  exchange or market are
valued according to the broadest and most  representative  market, as determined
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser").  Portfolio securities primarily traded in
foreign  markets are generally  valued at the preceding  closing  values of such
securities on their respective  exchanges or markets.  Securities and assets for
which market quotations are not readily available are valued at their fair value
as  determined  in good  faith  under  procedures  established  by and under the
general  supervision of the Board of Trustees.  Short term debt  securities with
remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, unless the
Board of Trustees determines such does not reflect the securities fair value, in
which case these  securities will be valued at their fair value as determined by
the Board of Trustees.  Debt instruments  having a maturity greater than 60 days
for which  market  quotations  are  readily  available  are valued at the latest
average of the bid and asked  prices.  If there were no asked  prices  quoted on
such day,  the  security  is valued  using  the  closing  bid price on that day.
Options  are  valued at the last sale  price on the  exchange  on which they are
listed.  If no sales of such  options  have taken  place that day,  they will be
valued at the mean between their closing bid and asked prices.

     REPURCHASE  AGREEMENTS.   The  Utility  Trust  may  enter  into  repurchase
agreements with primary government  securities dealers recognized by the Federal
Reserve  Bank of New York,  with member banks of the Federal  Reserve  System or
with

                                       5
<PAGE>
                            THE GABELLI UTILITY TRUST
              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

other brokers or dealers that meet credit guidelines  established by the Adviser
and reviewed by the Board of Trustees.  Under the terms of a typical  repurchase
agreement,  the Utility Trust takes  possession of an underlying debt obligation
subject to an obligation of the seller to  repurchase,  and the Utility Trust to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Utility Trust's  holding period.  The Utility Trust will always
receive and maintain  securities  as collateral  whose market  value,  including
accrued  interest,  will be at least equal to 102% of the dollar amount invested
by the Utility Trust in each agreement.  The Utility Trust will make payment for
such  securities  only upon  physical  delivery  or upon  evidence of book entry
transfer of the collateral to the account of the  custodian.  To the extent that
any repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral
is marked-to-market on a daily basis to maintain the adequacy of the collateral.
If the seller defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy
proceedings   are  commenced  with  respect  to  the  seller  of  the  security,
realization of the collateral by the Utility Trust may be delayed or limited.

     SECURITIES  SOLD SHORT. A short sale involves  selling a security which the
Utility  Trust does not own. The proceeds  received for short sales are recorded
as liabilities  and the Utility Trust records an unrealized  gain or loss to the
extent of the difference between the proceeds received and the value of the open
short position on the day of determination. The Utility Trust records a realized
gain or loss when the short  position is closed  out.  By entering  into a short
sale,  the Utility Trust bears the market risk of an  unfavorable  change in the
price of the  security  sold short.  Dividends on short sales are recorded as an
expense by the Utility  Trust on the  ex-dividend  date and interest  expense is
recorded on the accrual basis.

     FOREIGN  CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  The books and records of the Utility Trust
are maintained in United States (U.S.) dollars. Foreign currencies,  investments
and other  assets  and  liabilities  are  translated  into U.S.  dollars  at the
exchange rates  prevailing at the end of the period,  and purchases and sales of
investment  securities,  income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate
prevailing on the respective  dates of such  transactions.  Unrealized gains and
losses,  which result from changes in foreign  exchange  rates and/or changes in
market    prices   of    securities,    have   been   included   in   unrealized
appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign currency transactions.  Net
realized  foreign  currency gains and losses  resulting from changes in exchange
rates  include  foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  between  trade  date  and
settlement  date  on  investment  securities   transactions,   foreign  currency
transactions  and the  difference  between the amounts of interest and dividends
recorded on the books of the Utility  Trust and the amounts  actually  received.
The  portion of foreign  currency  gains and losses  related to  fluctuation  in
exchange rates between the initial trade date and subsequent  sale trade date is
included in realized gain/(loss) on investments.

     SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME.  Securities transactions are
accounted  for as of the trade date with  realized  gain or loss on  investments
determined  by using the  identified  cost method.  Interest  income  (including
amortization  of premium  and  accretion  of  discount)  is  recorded as earned.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

     DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS.  Distributions to shareholders
are recorded on the  ex-dividend  date.  Income  distributions  and capital gain
distributions  are determined in accordance with Federal income tax regulations,
which may differ from  accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the United
States.

     PROVISION  FOR INCOME  TAXES.  The  Utility  Trust  intends to  continue to
qualify as a regulated  investment  company  under  Subchapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a result, a Federal income tax provision is
not required.

     Dividends and interest from non-U.S.  sources received by the Utility Trust
are generally subject to non-U.S.  withholding taxes at rates ranging up to 30%.
Such  withholding  taxes  may be  reduced  or  eliminated  under  the  terms  of
applicable U.S. income tax treaties,  and the Utility Trust intends to undertake
any procedural steps required to claim the benefits of such treaties.

              NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) (UNAUDITED)

3. AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS  WITH  AFFILIATES.  The Utility Trust has entered
into an  investment  advisory  agreement  (the  "Advisory  Agreement")  with the
Adviser which  provides that the Utility Trust will pay the Adviser on the first
business day of each month a fee for the previous month equal on an annual basis
to 1.00% of the  value of the  Utility  Trust's  average  daily net  assets.  In
accordance  with the  Advisory  Agreement,  the  Adviser  provides a  continuous
investment   program  for  the  Utility  Trust's   portfolio  and  oversees  the
administration of all aspects of the Utility Trust's business and affairs.

     During the six months ended June 30, 2003, Gabelli & Company, Inc. received
$26,975 in brokerage commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in
portfolio securities on behalf of the Utility Trust.

     The cost of  calculating  the  Trust's net asset value per share is a Trust
expense pursuant to the  Investment Advisory Agreement between the Trust and the
Adviser.  During the six months ended June 30, 2003,  the Gabelli  Utility Trust
reimbursed  the Adviser  $17,400 in  connection  with the cost of computing  the
Trust's net asset value.

4.  PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES.   Cost  of  purchases  and  proceeds  from  sales  of
securities,  other than short-term securities, for the six months ended June 30,
2003 aggregated $13,736,614 and $2,710,040, respectively.

5.  CAPITAL.  The Board of  Trustees  of the Utility  Trust has  authorized  the
repurchase  of its shares on the open  market  when the shares are  trading at a
discount of 10% or more (or such other  percentage  as the Board of Trustees may
determine from time to time) from the net asset value of the shares.  During the
six months ended June 30, 2003,  the Utility Trust did not repurchase any shares
of beneficial interest in the open market.

     On May 22, 2002, the Utility Trust  distributed one transferable  right for
each of the 11,294,893  common shares  outstanding to  shareholders of record on
that date. Three rights were required to purchase one additional common share at
the subscription  price of $7.50 per share.  The subscription  period expired on
June 27,  2002.  The  rights  offering  was fully  subscribed  resulting  in the
issuance of 3,764,965  common shares and proceeds of  $28,237,239 to the Utility
Trust, prior to the deduction of estimated  expenses of $500,000.  The net asset
value per  share of the  Utility  Trust  common  shareholders  was  enhanced  by
approximately  $0.15 per share as a result of the  issuance of shares  above net
asset value.

     Transactions in shares of beneficial interest were as follows:

6. INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION. Because the Utility Trust primarily invests in common
stocks and other  securities  of foreign and  domestic  companies in the utility
industry,  its portfolio may be subject to greater risk and market  fluctuations
than a portfolio of securities representing a broad range of investments.

7.  SUBSEQUENT  EVENTS.  On July 31, 2003, the Gabelli  Utility Trust issued two
series of  Preferred  Shares  valued  at a total of $55  million.  The  issuance
consists of $30 million of 5.625% Series A Cumulative  Preferred  Shares and $25
million of Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares.

     On August 12, 2003,  the Gabelli  Utility  Trust  announced  the terms of a

any time during the subscription  period. The Rights are transferable,  with the
subscription  period  commencing  on  August  20,  2003  (the  record  date) and
terminating 34 days later on September 23, 2003 (the  expiration  date),  unless

     reimbursement had not occurred, the annualized ratios of net investment
     income and operating expenses to average net assets would have been 1.85%
     and 2.17%, respectively.
(d)  The ratios do not include a reduction of expenses for custodian fee credits
     on cash balances maintained with the custodian. Including such custodian
     fee credits for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and the year ended
     December 31, 2002, 2001, and 2000, the expense ratios would be 1.93%,
     1.93%, 2.00% and 1.93%, respectively.
(e)  2001's net investment income per share and net realized and unrealized gain
     (loss) on investments were originally presented in the Financial Highlights
     without regard to the character of distributions paid during the year.
     Amounts as previously reported of $0.61 and $(0.81), respectively, have
     been revised to reflect reclassification of amounts based on the character
     of 2001 distributions.

                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

                         AUTOMATIC DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT
                        AND VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

ENROLLMENT IN THE PLAN

   It  is  the  policy  of  The  Gabelli  Utility  Trust  ("Utility  Trust")  to
automatically   reinvest   dividends.   As  a   "registered"   shareholder   you
automatically  become a participant in the Utility  Trust's  Automatic  Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan (the "Plan").  The Plan authorizes the Utility Trust to issue
shares to participants  upon an income dividend or a capital gains  distribution
regardless  of whether  the shares are trading at a discount or a premium to net
asset value. All  distributions  to shareholders  whose shares are registered in
their  own  names  will be  automatically  reinvested  pursuant  to the  Plan in
additional  shares of the Utility Trust.  Plan participants may send their stock
certificates  to  EquiServe  Trust  Company  ("EquiServe")  to be held in  their
dividend reinvestment account.  Registered shareholders wishing to receive their
distribution in cash must submit this request in writing to:

                            The Gabelli Utility Trust
                                  c/o EquiServe
                                 P.O. Box 43011
                            Providence, RI 02940-3011

   Shareholders  requesting  this cash election  must include the  shareholder's
name and  address as they  appear on the share  certificate.  Shareholders  with
additional  questions  regarding  the  Plan  may  contact  EquiServe  at 1 (800)
336-6983.

   SHAREHOLDERS WISHING TO LIQUIDATE REINVESTED SHARES held at EquiServe must do
so in writing or by telephone. Please submit your request to the above mentioned
address or telephone  number.  Include in your  request  your name,  address and
account number. The cost to liquidate shares is $2.50 per transaction as well as
the brokerage  commission  incurred.  Brokerage  charges are expected to be less
than the usual brokerage charge for such transactions.

   If your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or nominee,  you should
contact such institution.  If such institution is not participating in the Plan,
your account will be credited with a cash  dividend.  In order to participate in
the Plan through  such  institution,  it may be  necessary  for you to have your
shares  taken out of  "street  name" and  re-registered  in your own name.  Once
registered in your own name your  dividends  will be  automatically  reinvested.
Certain brokers participate in the Plan.  Shareholders holding shares in "street
name"  at   participating   institutions   will  have  dividends   automatically
reinvested.  Shareholders  wishing  a cash  dividend  at such  institution  must
contact their broker to make this change.

   The number of shares of Common Stock  distributed to participants in the Plan
in lieu of cash dividends is determined in the following manner. Under the Plan,
whenever  the market  price of the Utility  Trust's  Common Stock is equal to or
exceeds  net  asset  value  at the  time  shares  are  valued  for  purposes  of
determining  the number of shares  equivalent  to the cash  dividends or capital
gains distribution, participants are issued shares of Common Stock valued at the
greater of (i) the net asset value as most  recently  determined  or (ii) 95% of
the then current market price of the Utility Trust's Common Stock. The valuation
date is the dividend or distribution  payment date or, if that date is not a New
York Stock Exchange trading day, the next trading day. If the net asset value of
the Common Stock at the time of valuation exceeds the market price of the Common
Stock,  participants will receive shares from the Utility Trust valued at market
price.  If the  Utility  Trust  should  declare  a  dividend  or  capital  gains
distribution  payable only in cash,  EquiServe will buy Common Stock in the open
market,  or on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,  for the  participants'
accounts, except that EquiServe will endeavor to terminate purchases in the open
market  and  cause the  Utility  Trust to issue  shares  at net asset  value if,
following the  commencement  of such  purchases,  the market value of the Common
Stock exceeds the then current net asset value.

   The automatic  reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions will
not  relieve  participants  of any  income  tax  which  may be  payable  on such
distributions.  A participant in the Plan will be treated for Federal income tax
purposes  as  having  received,  on a  dividend  payment  date,  a  dividend  or
distribution in an amount equal to the cash the participant  could have received
instead of shares.

   The  Utility  Trust  reserves  the  right to amend or  terminate  the Plan as
applied to any voluntary  cash  payments  made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent to written notice of the change sent to the members of the Plan
at least 90 days before the record date for such dividend or  distribution.  The
Plan also may be amended or terminated by EquiServe on at least 90 days' written
notice to participants in the Plan.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PLAN

   The Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan is yet another vehicle for our  shareholders
to increase their  investment in the Utility  Trust.  In order to participate in
the Voluntary Cash Purchase Plan, shareholders must have their shares registered
in their own name.

   Participants  in the  Voluntary  Cash Purchase Plan have the option of making
additional  cash payments to EquiServe for  investments  in the Utility  Trust's
shares at the then current  market price.  Shareholders  may send an amount from
$250 to $10,000.  EquiServe will use these funds to purchase  shares in the open
market on or about the 1st and 15th of each  month.  EquiServe  will charge each
shareholder  who  participates  $0.75,  plus a pro rata  share of the  brokerage
commissions.  Brokerage  charges for such purchases are expected to be less than
the usual  brokerage  charge for such  transactions.  It is  suggested  that any
voluntary  cash payments be sent to EquiServe,  P.O. Box 43011,  Providence,  RI
02940-3011  such that  EquiServe  receives such payments  approximately  10 days
before  the 1st and 15th of the  month.  Funds not  received  at least five days
before the investment date shall be held for investment in the following  month.
A payment may be withdrawn  without charge if notice is received by EquiServe at
least 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

   For more information  regarding the Dividend  Reinvestment Plan and Voluntary
Cash Purchase  Plan,  brochures  are  available by calling (914)  921-5070 or by
writing directly to the Utility Trust.
