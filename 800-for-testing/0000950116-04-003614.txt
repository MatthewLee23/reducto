DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLANS
Each Fund offers an automatic dividend reinvestment program. If Fund shares are
registered in your name and you are not already reinvesting dividends but would
like to do so, contact the dividend plan agent, Mellon Investor Services,
L.L.C., at 800 851-9677. You will be asked to put your request in writing. If
you have shares registered in "street" name, contact your financial advisor or
the broker/dealer holding the shares.

Under the current policies of Arizona Municipal Income Fund, Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund, Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, and Minnesota Municipal
Income Fund II, all distributions of net investment income and capital gains to
common stock shareholders are automatically reinvested in additional shares
unless shareholders elect to receive all dividends and other distributions in
cash paid by check mailed directly to shareholders by the dividend plan agent.
Under the current policies of Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund and
Minnesota Municipal Income Fund III, distributions of net investment income and
capital gains to common shareholders will be paid in cash unless shareholders
notify Mellon Investor Services, L.L.C. of their desire to participate in the
dividend reinvestment program.

After each Fund declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gains
distribution, the plan agent will, as agent for the participants, receive the
cash payment and use it to buy shares in the open market on the American Stock
Exchange. The Funds will not issue any new shares in connection with the plan.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
    this change for the period ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
    investment income per share of $0.006, a decrease in net realized and
    unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.006, and an increase in the ratio of
    net investment income to average net assets of 0.04%. Per share data and
    ratios for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect
    this change in accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Total investment return reflects a
    waiver and payment of fees by the manager and distributors, as applicable.
    Performance would have been lower had the expense limitation not been in
    effect.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(6) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized.

The average shares outstanding method has been applied for per share information
for the six months ended 9/30/04 and the year ended 3/31/04.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
    this change for the period ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
    investment income per share of $0.003, a decrease in net realized and
    unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.003, and an increase in the ratio of
    net investment income to average net assets of 0.02%. Per share data and
    ratios for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect
    this change in accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(6) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized. The average shares outstanding method has been applied for
    per share information for the six months ended 9/30/04 and the year ended
    3/31/04.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. The effect of
    this change for the period ended March 31, 2002 was an increase in net
    investment income per share of $0.002, a decrease in net realized and
    unrealized gain (loss) per share of $0.002, and an increase in the ratio of
    net investment income to average net assets of 0.02%. Per share data and
    ratios for periods prior to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect
    this change in accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(6) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized.

The average shares outstanding method has been applied for per share information
for the six months ended 9/30/04 and the year ended 3/31/04.

    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

(5) Excluding any accumulated but unpaid dividends.

(6) Ratios and portfolio turnover have been annualized and total return has not
    been annualized.

The average shares outstanding method has been applied for per share information
for the six months ended 9/30/04 and the year ended 3/31/04.

(1) As required, effective April 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the
    AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies that require
    amortization of all premiums and discounts on debt securities. This change
    in accounting had no effect on the Fund's results of operations for the
    period ended March 31, 2002. Per share data and ratios for the periods prior
    to April 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
    accounting.

(2) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    each period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    the purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under
    the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based
    on market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods.

(3) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
    shareholders.

(4) Ratio reflects total net investment income less dividends paid to preferred
    shareholders from net investment income divided by average net assets
    applicable to common shareholders.

    been annualized.

NOTES                       September 30, 2004 (Unaudited)
  TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal
Fund"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income Fund II, Inc.
("Minnesota Municipal Fund II"); Delaware Investments Minnesota Municipal Income
Fund III, Inc. ("Minnesota Municipal Fund III"); Delaware Investments Arizona
Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Arizona Municipal Fund"), and Delaware Investments
Colorado Insured Municipal Income Fund, Inc. ("Colorado Insured Municipal Fund")
are organized as Minnesota corporations and Delaware Investments Florida Insured
Municipal Income Fund ("Florida Insured Municipal Fund") is organized as a
Massachusetts Business Trust (each referred to as a "Fund" and collectively as
the "Funds"). The Minnesota Municipal Fund II, Florida Insured Municipal Fund
and Arizona Municipal Fund are diversified closed-end management investment
companies and Minnesota Municipal Fund, Minnesota Municipal Fund III and
Colorado Insured Municipal Fund are non-diversified closed-end management
investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Funds' shares trade on the American Stock Exchange.

The investment objective of each Fund is to provide high current income exempt
from federal income tax and from the personal income tax of its state, if any,
consistent with the preservation of capital. Florida Insured Municipal Fund will
generally seek investments that will enable its shares to be exempt from
Florida's intangible personal property tax. Each Fund will seek to achieve its
investment objective by investing substantially all of its net assets in
investment grade, tax-exempt municipal obligations of its respective state.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following accounting policies are in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and are consistently followed by the Funds.

Security Valuation - Long-term debt securities are valued by an independent
pricing service and such prices are believed to reflect the fair value of such
securities. Short-term debt securities having less than 60 days to maturity are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other securities and
assets for which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair
value as determined in good faith under the direction of the Funds' Board of
Trustees/Directors.

Federal Income Taxes - Each Fund intends to continue to qualify for federal
income tax purposes as a regulated investment company and make the requisite
distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income
taxes has been made in the financial statements.

Use of Estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.

Other - Expenses common to all funds within the Delaware Investments Family of
Funds are allocated amongst the Funds on the basis of average net assets.
Management fees and some other expenses are paid monthly. Security transactions
are recorded on the date the securities are purchased or sold (trade date).
Costs used in calculating realized gains and losses on the sale of investment
securities are those of the specific securities sold. Interest income is
recorded on the accrual basis. Discounts and premiums are amortized to interest
income over the lives of the respective securities. Each Fund declares and pays
dividends from net investment income monthly and distributions from net realized
gain on investments, if any, annually.
<PAGE>

In addition, in order to satisfy certain distribution requirements of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, the Funds may declare special year-end dividend and capital
gains distributions during November or December to shareholders of record on a
date in such month. Such distributions, if received by shareholders by January
31, are deemed to have been paid by the Funds and received by shareholders on
the earlier of the date paid for December 31 of the prior year.

Expenses Paid Indirectly - The Funds may receive earnings credits from their
custodian when positive cash balances are maintained, which are used to offset
custody fees. The expenses paid under the above arrangement is included in the
custodian fees on the Statement of Operations with the corresponding expense
offset shown as "expenses paid indirectly." The amount of this expense for the
six months ended September 30, 2004, were as follows:

2. INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH
AFFILIATES
In accordance with the terms of its respective investment management agreement,
each Fund pays Delaware Management Company (DMC), a series of Delaware
Management Business Trust and the investment manager, an annual fee of 0.40%
which is calculated daily based on the average daily net assets of each Fund,
including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be outstanding.

As of September 1, 2004, DMC has contractually agreed to waive that portion, if
any, of its management fee and reimburse the Minnesota Municipal Fund to the
extent necessary to ensure that annual operating expenses, exclusive of taxes,
interest, brokerage commissions, distribution fees, certain insurance costs and
extraordinary expenses, do not exceed 0.72% of average daily net assets of the
Fund, including assets attributable to any preferred stock that may be
outstanding, through March 31, 2005.

The Funds have engaged Delaware Service Company, Inc., (DSC), an affiliate of
DMC, to provide accounting and administration services which are based on
average net assets and paid on a monthly basis, subject to certain minimums.

For financial reporting purposes, capital accounts and distributions to
shareholders are adjusted to reflect the tax character of permanent book/tax
differences. For the six months ended September 30, 2004, the Funds recorded an
estimate of these differences since the final tax characteristics cannot be
determined until fiscal year end. Reclassifications are primarily due to tax
treatment of market discount and premium on certain debt instruments. Results of
operations and net assets were not affected by these reclassifications.

Salomon Smith Barney, Inc. and Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc.
(Colorado Insured Municipal Fund only), as the remarketing agents, receive an
annual fee from each of the Funds of 0.25% of the average amount of preferred
stock outstanding.

Under the 1940 Act, the Funds may not declare dividends or make other
distributions on common shares or purchase any such shares if, at the time of
the declaration, distribution or purchase, asset coverage with respect to the
outstanding preferred stock is less than 200%. The preferred shares are
redeemable at the option of the Funds, in whole or in part, on any dividend
payment date at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared. The preferred shares are also subject to mandatory
redemption at $50,000 per share plus any accumulated but unpaid dividends
whether or not declared, if certain requirements relating to the composition of
the assets and liabilities of each Fund are not satisfied. The holders of
preferred shares have voting rights equal to the holders of common shares (one
vote per share) and will vote together with holders of common shares as a single
class. However, holders of preferred shares are also entitled to elect two of
each Fund's Directors. In addition, the 1940 Act requires that along with
approval by shareholders that might otherwise be required, the approval of the
holders of a majority of any outstanding preferred shares, voting separately as
a class, would be required to (a) adopt any plan of reorganization that would
adversely affect the preferred shares, and (b) take any action requiring a vote
of security holders pursuant of Section 13(a) of the 1940 Act, including, among
other things, changes in each of the Fund's subclassification as a closed-end
investment company or changes in their fundamental investment restrictions.

6. CREDIT AND MARKET RISKS
The Funds concentrate their investments in securities issued by municipalities.
The value of these investments may be adversely affected by new legislation
within the state, regional or local economic conditions, and differing levels of
supply and demand for municipal bonds. Many municipalities insure repayment for
their obligations. Although bond insurance reduces the risk of loss due to
default by an issuer, such bonds remain subject to the risk that market value
may fluctuate for other reasons and there is no assurance that the insurance
company will meet its obligations. These securities have been identified in the
Statements of Net Assets.

The Funds may invest in inverse floating rate securities ("inverse floaters"), a
type of derivative tax-exempt obligation with floating or variable interest
rates that move in the opposite direction of short-term interest rates, usually
at an accelerated speed. Consequently, the market values of inverse floaters
will generally be more volatile than other tax-exempt investments. Such
securities are denoted on the Statements of Net Assets.

7. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS
The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Funds
have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

8. TAX INFORMATION
The information set forth is for the Funds' semi-annual period as required by
federal laws. Shareholders, however, must report distributions on a calendar
year basis for income tax purposes, which may include distributions for portions
of two fiscal years of the fund. Accordingly, the information needed by
shareholders for income tax purposes will be sent to them in January of each
year. Please consult your tax advisor for proper treatment of this information.
The information presented below is subject to change since final tax
characteristics cannot be determined until fiscal year end.
For the six months ended September 30, 2004, each Fund designates as long-term
capital gains, ordinary income, and tax-exempt income distributions paid during
the year as follows:

         employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal

     (a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
         disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our

         us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
         which this report is being prepared;

     (b) designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
         internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
         supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
         of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
         external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
         principles.

     (c) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
         procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
         effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date

         control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's
         most recent fiscal half-year (the registrant's second fiscal half-year
         in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is
         reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
         operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
         reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
         record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
         employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
         control over financial reporting.
