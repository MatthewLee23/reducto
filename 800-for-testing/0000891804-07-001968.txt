      Chairman's
            LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Photo of: Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Timothy R. Schwertfeger
Chairman of the Board

      Once again, I am pleased to report that over the six-month period covered
      by this report your Fund continued to provide you with attractive monthly
      tax-free income. For more details about the management strategy and
      performance of your Fund, please read the Portfolio Managers' Comments,
      the Dividend and Share Price Information, and the Performance Overview
      sections of this report.

      For some time, I've used these letters to remind you that municipal bonds
      can be an important building block in a well-balanced investment
      portfolio. In addition to providing attractive tax-free monthly income, a
      municipal bond investment like your Fund may help you achieve and benefit
      from greater portfolio diversification. Portfolio diversification is a
      recognized way to try to reduce some of the risk that comes with
      investing. For more information about this important investment strategy,
      I encourage you to contact your personal financial advisor.

"IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING ATTRACTIVE TAX-FREE MONTHLY INCOME, A MUNICIPAL BOND
INVESTMENT LIKE YOUR FUND MAY HELP YOU ACHIEVE AND BENEFIT FROM GREATER
PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION."

      We also are pleased to be able to offer you a choice concerning how you
      receive your shareholder reports and other Fund information. As an
      alternative to mailed copies, you can sign up to receive future Fund
      reports and other Fund information by e-mail and the internet. The inside

Nuveen Investments Municipal Closed-End Funds
NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, NXZ, NZF

Portfolio Managers'
         COMMENTS

PORTFOLIO MANAGERS TOM SPALDING AND PAUL BRENNAN REVIEW KEY INVESTMENT
STRATEGIES AND THE SIX-MONTH PERFORMANCE OF THESE SIX NATIONAL FUNDS. A 30-YEAR
VETERAN OF NUVEEN, TOM HAS MANAGED NXZ SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2001 AND NPP, NMA,
NMO, AND NAD SINCE 2003. WITH 16 YEARS OF INVESTMENT EXPERIENCE AT NUVEEN, PAUL
ASSUMED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NZF IN JULY 2006.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE SIX-MONTH
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2007?

During this six-month period, we continued to see a further flattening of the
municipal bond yield curve. In this environment, where the slope of the yield
curve remained a dominant market factor, we continued to emphasize a disciplined
approach to duration 1 management and yield curve positioning. As part of this
approach, our purchases for the Funds' portfolios focused mainly on attractively
priced bonds with maturities of 20 years and longer in NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, and
NXZ and 25 years and longer in NZF. We believed that bonds in this range of the
curve generally offered more attractive yields, better value, and reward
opportunities more commensurate with their risk levels.

Our duration management strategies during this period included the use of
inverse floating rate trusts, 2 a type of derivative financial instrument, in
all six of these Funds. The inverse floaters had the dual benefit of increasing
the Funds' distributable income and bringing their durations closer to our
preferred strategic target. In past shareholder reports, we also discussed the
use of forward interest rate swaps and futures contracts, which are additional
types of derivative instruments, as duration management tools. During this
reporting period, NZF continued to use both of these tools to help increase net
asset value (NAV) volatility.

We also continued to put emphasis on individual credit selection, using a
long-term relative value approach. During this period, the municipal market saw
steady new money issuance as well as a number of major advance refundings 3 and
debt restructurings, which provided us with an increased number of bonds from
which to choose. For the six months ended April 30, 2007, municipal issuance
nationwide

1     Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity as interest rates
      change, with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these
      changes than bonds with shorter durations.

2     An inverse floating rate trust is a financial instrument designed to pay
      long-term tax-exempt interest at a rate that varies inversely with a
      short-term tax-exempt interest rate index. For the Nuveen Funds, the index
      typically used is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets (SIFM)
      Municipal Swap Index (previously referred to as the Bond Market
      Association Index or BMA). Inverse floaters, including those inverse
      floating rate securities in which the Funds invested during the six-month
      period, are further defined within the "Notes to Financial Statements" and
      "Glossary of Terms Used in This Report" sections of this shareholder
      report.

3     Advance refundings, also known as pre-refundings or refinancings, occur
      when an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund principal and
      interest payments of older existing bonds. This process often results in
      lower borrowing costs for bond issuers.

totaled $223.7 billion, up 32% compared with the six-month period ended April
30, 2006. During the first four months of 2007, supply increased 37% over that
of the first four months of 2006--to $135.4 billion--primarily due to a 71%
increase in refundings during this period.

Much of the new supply was highly rated and/or insured, and this factor,
combined with the enhanced credit quality resulting from a number of advance
refundings, meant that the Funds' allocations of credits rated AAA generally
increased over this period. We also continued to work to maintain the Funds'
weightings of lower credit quality bonds because of their strong performance and
support for the Funds' income streams. However, as credit spreads continued to
tighten, we generally found fewer attractively structured lower-rated credit
opportunities in the market.

In NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, and NXZ, most of the cash we redeployed during this
period came from called holdings, which we used to enhance the Funds'
diversification by investing in a variety of essential services sectors such as
water and sewer and utilities. We also continued to keep these Funds well
diversified geographically, looking to states with stronger issuance, including
California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois for many of the additions to
our portfolios.

In NZF, in addition to reinvesting a few bond call proceeds, we selectively sold
some of the Fund's holdings that were nearing redemption. We continued to
redeploy proceeds to bonds that could help us increase income-generating
potential, such as credits with unusual types of coupons, including zero coupon
and discount bonds. This purchase activity during this period was also directed
toward higher-grade bonds with interesting structures and characteristics that
represented opportunities to add value, manage duration and volatility, and
support earnings.

                                                                               5

For the six months ended April 30, 2007, the cumulative returns on NAV for NXZ
and NZF exceeded the return on the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, while
NPP, NMA, NMO and NAD under-performed the index return, NXZ and NZF also
outperformed the average return for their Lipper peer group for this period,
while the remaining four Funds trailed the group average.

Factors that influenced the Funds' returns during this period included duration,
individual security selection, exposure to lower-rated credits, sector
allocations and advance refunding activity.

As the yield curve continued to flatten over the course of this period,
municipal bonds with maturities of 20 years and longer, as measured by the
Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, performed best, generally outpacing
municipal bonds with shorter maturities. As mentioned earlier, one of our
strategies during this period focused on adding

longer bonds to our portfolios. This purchase activity and our duration
management strategies helped to extend the Funds' durations and bring them
closer in line with our preferred strategic range.

During this period, we also continued to employ strategies that we believed
could help to strengthen the future income streams of our portfolios. In
addition to income potential, the Funds' holdings of zero coupon bonds, which we
continued to build, also provided a positive impact on performance for this
period.

With bonds rated BBB or lower and non-rated bonds generally outperforming other
credit quality sectors during this period, all of these Funds benefited from
their weightings in lower-quality credits. The outperformance of these credit
sectors was largely the result of investor demand for the higher yields
typically associated with lower-rated bonds, which drove up their value. NXZ,
NZF, and NAD had heavier exposures to subinvestment-grade (bonds rated BB or
lower) and non-rated bonds than the other three Funds, which was especially
helpful during this period.

Among the lower-rated holdings making positive contributions to the Funds'
returns for this period were industrial development bonds and health care
(including hospitals) credits. Lower-rated bonds backed by the 1998 master
tobacco settlement agreement, which comprised approximately 3% to 5% of the
portfolios of these Funds as of April 30, 2007, performed well.

We also continued to see positive contributions from advance refunding activity,
which benefited the Funds through price appreciation and enhanced credit
quality. Two of the more significant advance refundings during this period
involved BBB rated tobacco bonds issued by California's Golden State Tobacco
Securitization Corporation and New Jersey's Tobacco Settlement Financing
Corporation, which were upgraded to AAA as a result of the refundings.

At the same time, holdings of older, previously pre-refunded bonds tended to
underperform the general municipal market during this period, particularly those
with effective maturities between 5 and 10 years. Entering this period, NMO had
a significantly heavier weighting in older pre-refunded bonds than the other
Funds in this report.

                                                                               7

Dividend and Share Price
         INFORMATION

These six Funds use leverage to potentially enhance opportunities for additional
income for common shareholders. Although the Funds' use of this strategy
continued to provide incremental income, the extent of this benefit was reduced
during this period due to high short-term interest rates that, in turn, kept the
Funds' borrowing costs high. Older, higher-yielding bonds that matured or were
called also had an impact on the Funds' income streams, as proceeds were
reinvested into bonds currently available in the market, which generally offered
lower yields. While bond calls had the greater impact, the combination of both
of these factors resulted in one monthly dividend reduction in NMO, NAD, and NZF
over the six-month period ended April 30, 2007. The dividends of NPP, NMA and
NXZ remained stable throughout this six-month period.

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of April 30, 2007, all the
Funds had positive UNII balances for both financial statements and based on our
best estimate, tax purposes.

As of April 30, 2007, the Funds' share prices were trading at premiums or
discounts to their NAVs as shown in the accompanying chart:

1     Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
      fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
      after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
      comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend
      income, the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

                                                                              13

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding Common
share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NPP), Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market
Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD),
Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 3 (NZF). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA),
Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)
are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations
issued by state and local government authorities or certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

INVESTMENT VALUATION

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service may establish fair value based on
yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of forward swap contracts are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Futures
contracts are valued using the closing settlement price, or, in the absence of
such a price, at the mean of the bid and asked prices. If the pricing service is
unable to supply a price for a municipal bond, forward swap contract or futures
contract, each Fund may use a market price or fair market value quote provided
by a major broker/dealer in such investments. If it is determined that the
market price or fair market value for an investment is unavailable or
inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee,
may establish a fair value for the investment. Temporary investments in
securities that have variable rate and demand features qualifying them as
short-term investments are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market
value.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2007, Municipal
Advantage (NMA), Dividend Advantage (NAD) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF) had
outstanding when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments of $17,318,032,
$10,071,929, and $8,715,237, respectively. There were no such outstanding
purchase commitments in either Performance Plus (NPP), Market Opportunity (NMO)
or Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) at April 30, 2007.

INVESTMENT INCOME

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all net investment income and net capital
gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, to retain
such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of the Funds. Net
realized capital gains and ordinary income distributions paid by the Funds are
subject to federal taxation.

78

<PAGE>


DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

PREFERRED SHARES

The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate paid by the Funds on each
Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process
overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end of each rate period.
The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each
Fund is as follows:

=========================================================================================================

</TABLE>

INVERSE FLOATING RATE SECURITIES

Each Fund may invest in inverse floating rate securities. An inverse floating
rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond, typically with a fixed
interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a broker-dealer. In turn,
this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in face amounts equal to some
fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market value, that typically pay
short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties, and (b) issues to a
long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse floating rate
certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that represents all
remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received by the inverse
floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to the floating
rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse floater holder
bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside investment risk and
also benefits disproportionately from any potential appreciation of the
underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating rate security will be
more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the interest rate is
dependent on not only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying bond but also on
the short-term interest paid on the floating rate certificates, and because the
inverse floating rate security essentially bears the risk of loss of the greater
face value of the underlying bond.

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). An investment in an externally-deposited
inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of Investments as an "Inverse
floating rate investment". An investment in a self-deposited inverse floater is
accounted for as a financing transaction in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140 "Accounting for Transfers and
Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities". In such
instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited into a special purpose trust is
identified in the Portfolio of Investments as an "Underlying bond of an inverse
floating rate trust", with the Fund accounting for the short-term floating rate
certificates issued by the trust as "Floating rate obligations" on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, the Fund reflects in Investment Income
the entire earnings of the underlying bond and accounts for the related interest
paid to the holders of the short-term floating rate certificates as "Floating
rate obligations interest expense and fees" in the Statement of Operations.

During the six months ended April 30, 2007, each Fund invested in externally
deposited inverse floaters and/or self-deposited inverse floaters.

The average floating rate obligations outstanding and average annual interest
rate and fees related to self-deposited inverse floaters during the six months
ended April 30, 2007, were as follows:

Notes to
        FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (continued)

FORWARD SWAP TRANSACTIONS

The Funds are authorized to invest in certain derivative financial instruments.
Each Fund's use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to help
the Fund manage its overall interest rate sensitivity, either shorter or longer,
generally to more closely align the Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that
of the broader municipal market. Forward interest rate swap transactions involve
each Fund's agreement with a counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed or
variable rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a
variable or fixed rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a
specified date in the future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment
obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward swap contract and the
termination date of the swap (which is akin to a bond's maturity). The value of
the Fund's swap commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the
extent to which long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the
swap's termination date increases or decreases. The Funds may terminate a swap
contract prior to the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss is
recognized. When a forward swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not involve
the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal, but rather
is settled in cash on a net basis. Each Fund intends, but is not obligated, to
terminate its forward swaps before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of
loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to
the credit risk associated with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment
to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon termination. To reduce such credit
risk, all counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based on the
daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately
equal to the amount of any unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold.
Reciprocally, when any of the Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract,
the Funds have instructed the custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as
collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss
above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral pledges are monitored and
subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations fluctuate, either up or
down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount.

FUTURES CONTRACTS

The Funds are authorized to invest in futures contracts. Upon entering into a
futures contract, a Fund is required to deposit with the broker an amount of
cash or liquid securities equal to a specified percentage of the contract
amount. This is known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation
margin") are made or received by a Fund each day, depending on the daily
fluctuation of the value of the contract.

During the period the futures contract is open, changes in the value of the
contract are recognized as an unrealized gain or loss by "marking-to-market" on
a daily basis to reflect the changes in market value of the contract. When the
contract is closed or expired, a Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract on the closing date and value
of the contract when originally entered into. Cash held by the broker to cover
initial margin requirements on open futures contracts, if any, is noted in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Additionally, the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities reflects a receivable or payable for the variation margin when
applicable.

Risks of investments in futures contracts include the possible adverse movement
of the securities or indices underlying the contracts, the possibility that
there may not be a liquid secondary market for the contracts and/or that a
change in the value of the contract may not correlate with a change in the value
of the underlying securities or indices.

CUSTODIAN FEE CREDIT

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Director/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

<PAGE>


USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

4. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to the treatment of paydown gains and losses, timing differences
in recognizing taxable market discount, timing differences in recognizing
certain gains and losses on investment transactions and the treatment of
investments in inverse floating rate transactions subject to SFAS No. 140. To
the extent that differences arise that are permanent in nature, such amounts are
reclassified within the capital accounts on the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities presented in the annual report, based on their federal tax basis
treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification. Temporary and
permanent differences do not impact the net asset values of the Funds.

At April 30, 2007, the cost of investments was as follows:

5. MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by Nuveen
Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen
Investments, Inc., ("Nuveen"), and a specific fund-level component, based only
on the amount of assets within each individual fund. This pricing structure
enables Nuveen fund shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within
each individual fund as well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets
managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Preferred shares)
of each Fund as follows:

===========================================================================================================

</TABLE>

(1)   The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
      calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
      the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
      preferred stock issued by or borrowings by the Nuveen funds) of
      Nuveen-sponsored funds in the U.S.

(2)   With respect to the complex-wide Managed Assets over $91 billion, the fee
      rate or rates that will apply to such assets will be determined at a later
      date. In the unlikely event that complex-wide Managed Assets reach $91
      billion prior to a determination of the complex-level fee rate or rates to
      be applied to Managed Assets in excess of $91 billion, the complex-level
      fee rate for such complex-wide Managed Assets shall be .1400% until such
      time as a different rate or rates is determined.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

        FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (continued)

6. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD INTERPRETATION NO. 48

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48).
FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the Funds' tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and is to be
applied to all open tax years as of the effective date. Recent SEC guidance
allows funds to delay implementing FIN 48 into NAV calculations until the fund's
last NAV calculation in the first required financial statement reporting period.
As a result, the Funds must begin to incorporate FIN 48 into their NAV
calculations by October 31, 2007. At this time, management is continuing to
evaluate the implications of FIN 48 and does not expect the adoption of FIN 48
will have a significant impact on the net assets or results of operations of the
Funds.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
NO. 157

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, "Fair Value
Measurements." This standard establishes a single authoritative definition of
fair value, sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires
additional disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to
fair value measurements already required or permitted by existing standards.
SFAS No. 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal
years. The changes to current generally accepted accounting principles from the
application of this standard relate to the definition of fair value, the methods
used to measure fair value, and the expanded disclosures about fair value
measurements. As of April 30, 2007, the Funds do not believe the adoption of
SFAS No. 157 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional
disclosures may be required about the inputs used to develop the measurements
and the effect of certain of the measurements included within the Statement of
Operations for the period.

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

On June 20, 2007, Nuveen Investments announced that it had entered into a
definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger ("Merger Agreement") with an investor
group majority-led by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC. Madison Dearborn Partners,
LLC is a private equity investment firm based in Chicago, Illinois. The investor
group includes affiliates of Merrill Lynch, Wachovia, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank
and Morgan Stanley. It is anticipated that Merrill Lynch and its affiliates will
be indirect "affiliated persons" (as that term is defined in the Investment
Company Act of 1940) of the Funds. Under the terms of the merger, each
outstanding share of Nuveen Investments' common stock (other than dissenting
shares) will be converted into the right to receive a specified amount of cash,
without interest. The merger is expected to be completed by the end of the year,
subject to customary conditions, including obtaining the approval of Nuveen
Investments shareholders, obtaining necessary fund and client consents
sufficient to satisfy the terms of the Merger Agreement, and expiration of
certain regulatory waiting periods. The obligations of Madison Dearborn
Partners, LLC to consummate the merger are not conditioned on its obtaining
financing. The Merger Agreement includes a "go shop" provision through July 19,
2007 during which Nuveen Investments may actively solicit and negotiate
competing takeover proposals.

The consummation of the merger will be deemed to be an "assignment" (as defined
in the 1940 Act) of the investment management agreement between each Fund and
the Adviser, and will result in the automatic termination of each Fund's
agreement. Prior to the consummation of the merger, it is anticipated that the
Board of Trustees of each Fund will consider a new investment management
agreement with the Adviser. If approved by the Board, the new agreement would be
presented to the Fund's shareholders for approval, and, if so approved by
shareholders, would take effect upon consummation of the merger. There can be no
assurance that the merger described above will be consummated as contemplated or
that necessary shareholder approvals will be obtained.

*     Annualized.

**    Total Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in the market
      price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. Total Return on Common Share Net
      Asset Value is the combination of changes in Common share net asset value,
      reinvested dividend income at net asset value and reinvested capital gains
      distributions at net asset value, if any. Total returns are not
      annualized.

***   After custodian fee credit, expense reimbursement, and legal fee refund,
      where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Preferred
      shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable
      to Preferred shares, where applicable.

(a)   Interest expense arises from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain
      inverse floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1 - Inverse Floating Rate Securities.

*     Annualized.

**    Total Return on Market Value is the combination of changes in the market
      price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
      reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
      per share at the time of reinvestment. Total Return on Common Share Net
      Asset Value is the combination of changes in Common share net asset value,
      reinvested dividend income at net asset value and reinvested capital gains
      distributions at net asset value, if any. Total returns are not
      annualized.

***   After custodian fee credit, expense reimbursement, and legal fee refund,
      where applicable.

+     The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++    Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Preferred
      shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets attributable
      to Preferred shares, where applicable.

(a)   Interest expense arises from the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain
      inverse floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully
      described in Footnote 1 - Inverse Floating Rate Securities.

(b)   For the six months ended April 30, 2007.

Reinvest Automatically
         EASILY AND CONVENIENTLY

NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET UP YOUR
REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END FUNDS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market price. If the
shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for your account will be
purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares on
the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the Fund's
shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the Plan
Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market
purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution in
newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value on the last business day
immediately prior to the purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to
purchase shares in the open market will normally be invested shortly after the
dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
before purchases are completed, the average purchase price per share may exceed
the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the acquisition of fewer
shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by
the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage commissions on open
market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These commissions usually
will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

<PAGE>


FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Glossary of
        TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal the
investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or market
price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if any) over the
time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of the number of years to maturity of
the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time to
maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the security.
This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise
of call provisions unless an escrow account has been established to redeem the
bond before maturity. The market value weighting for an investment in an inverse
floating rate security is the value of the portfolio's residual interest in the
inverse floating rate trust, and does not include the value of the floating rate
securities issued by the trust.

INVERSE FLOATERS: Inverse floating rate securities are created by depositing a
municipal bond, typically with a fixed interest rate, into a special purpose
trust created by a broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a) issues floating rate
certificates typically paying short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third
parties in amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or
market value, and (b) issues an inverse floating rate certificate (sometimes
referred to as an "inverse floater") to an investor (such as a Fund) interested
in gaining investment exposure to a long-term municipal bond. The income
received by the holder of the inverse floater varies inversely with the
short-term rate paid to the floating rate certificates' holders, and in most
circumstances the holder of the inverse floater bears substantially all of the
underlying bond's downside investment risk. The holder of the inverse floater
typically also benefits disproportionately from any potential appreciation of
the underlying bond's value. Hence, an inverse floater essentially represents an
investment in the underlying bond on a leveraged basis.

LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period over
which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently is a
measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes when
market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's duration,
the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as interest rates change.
Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for a Fund
and therefore is longer than the duration of the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated by
subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred shares
issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing
the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.
