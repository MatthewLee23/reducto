ANNUAL REPORT
2003

<Page>

     To our Shareholders:

At fiscal year-end on September 30, 2003, the net asset value per share of your
Fund was $16.68. The net asset value increased by 2.8% during the recent quarter
and the stock price increased 4.3%, which is on par with the AMEX Biotech Index
and Dow Jones Industrial Average, but lagging the NASDAQ Industrials and Russell
2000. Fiscal year share price performance experienced an increase of 47.7%. Of
the comparable indices, only the NASDAQ Industrials marked higher performance.
Net asset value performance data for the fiscal year and the quarter ended
September 30, 2003, compared to the major indices, are as follows:

</Table>

As was the case for the prior several quarters, during the most recent quarter
there has been a combination of both encouraging and cautionary economic signs.
On balance, we think there have been more ups than downs. Economic growth was
impressive and Wall Street economic analyst estimates for the next few quarters
are within a healthy range. Earnings reports for the third calendar quarter seem
to be exceeding expectations. Employment levels seem to be stabilizing or even
improving. There are few signs of near term interest rate increase by the
Federal Reserve. These kinds of factors, coupled with our entering a
presidential election year, suggest to many that we can be somewhat optimistic
about the near term. We are still worried about debt levels and have renewed
concerns about the potential impact of the geopolitical environment, but in
general we are optimistic about the next few quarters or so.

With respect to the biotechnology and healthcare areas, our thinking has not
changed much from last quarter. These sectors exhibited strong performance in
the second calendar quarter. After a significant run up in the appropriate
indices, we would not have been surprised to see some consolidation during the
summer months. So far that consolidation has been tractable. In the small market
capitalization sub sector, there has been some

                                        1
<Page>

volatility but we think that is healthy after the considerable gains achieved
earlier in the year. It seems that equity share prices are increasingly moving
based on company specific events rather than on sector based sentiment. There
have been a number of positive news items, including new product approvals,
which give us optimism. We think this is indicative of a biotech sector that is
maturing. The sector is now more than 25 years old. Its largest and best
companies are profitable. A few have larger market capitalization than some of
the traditional large capitalization pharmaceutical companies. This is to the
good and in our view argues for the long-term viability and vitality of the
biotech industry. We know we are repeating ourselves in saying this, but we
think healthcare in general and emerging healthcare/biotech, in particular,
offer very good prospects for the future.

So, while we are optimistic about our sector, we are quite sad about another
development. For our management company, the most notable moment by far in the
recent quarter has been the passing of Alan G. Carr, my friend, partner and
mentor, as well as the founder of your Fund. Alan was instrumental in my joining
Hambrecht & Quist Capital Management in 2000 and in my becoming President of
your Fund not long thereafter. Several of us at Hambrecht & Quist Capital
Management have enjoyed the benefit of Alan's advice and counsel for a
significant portion of the last three years. We have learned much from him that,
in combination with our own skills and experience, we will continue to apply on
behalf of your Fund. We miss him already.

In the last quarter, we did not add new companies to the venture portion of the
portfolio, and we did some minor follow-on investing in existing venture
holdings. Within the public portfolio, we purchased Enzon Pharmaceuticals and
Neurocrine Biosciences, and added to our existing positions in a number of
portfolio companies.

As always, we encourage the Fund's shareholders to contact us with any questions
or concerns they may have relating to the Fund.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF H&Q LIFE SCIENCES INVESTORS:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, of
changes in net assets and of cash flows and the financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of H&Q Life Sciences
Investors (the "Fund") at September 30, 2003, the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each
of the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each
of the three years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing
standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at September 30, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The financial statements of the Fund as of September 30, 2000 and for the two
years then ended were audited by other independent accountants whose report
dated November 3, 2000 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

     Investment Companies and began accreting discounts and amortizing premiums
     on all debt securities. The effect of this change for the year ended
     September 30, 2002 was a decrease in net investment loss per share of
     $.006, an increase in net realized and unrealized loss on investments per
     share of $.006 and a decrease in the ratio of net investment loss to
     average net assets from (1.28%) to (1.25%). Per share data and ratios for
     the periods prior to October 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               SEPTEMBER 30, 2003

(1) ORGANIZATION

       H&Q Life Sciences Investors (the Fund) is a Massachusetts business trust
    registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified
    closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is
    long-term capital appreciation through investment in securities of companies
    in the healthcare industries. The Fund invests primarily in securities of
    public and private companies that are believed to have significant potential
    for above-average growth. The Fund was organized on February 20, 1992 and
    commenced operations on May 8, 1992.

       The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of certain
    estimates by management in determining the entity's assets, liabilities,
    revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
    following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
    followed by the Fund, which are in conformity with those generally accepted
    in the United States of America.

    INVESTMENT SECURITIES

       Investments traded on national securities exchanges or in the
    over-the-counter market that are National Market System securities are
    valued at the last sale price or, lacking any sales, at the mean between the
    last bid and asked prices. Other over-the-counter securities are valued at
    the most recent bid prices as obtained from one or more dealers that make
    markets in the securities. As indicated in Note 4, investments for which
    market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
    determined in good faith by the Trustees of the Fund. Temporary cash
    investments with maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.

       Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Gains and
    losses from sales of investments are recorded using the "identified cost"
    method. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, adjusted for
    amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Dividend income is
    recorded on the ex-dividend date.

    FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

       It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
    Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute
    to its shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and its net
    realized capital gains, if any. Therefore, no Federal income or excise tax
    provision is required.

    DISTRIBUTIONS

       The Fund records all distributions to shareholders from net investment
    income, if any, and realized gains on the ex-dividend date. Such
    distributions are determined in conformity with income tax regulations. The
    Fund has adjusted for the effect of certain permanent book/tax differences,
    which primarily related to net operating losses, short-term capital gains
    and market discount for the year ended September 30, 2003. This adjustment
    has no effect on the Fund's net assets, net investment loss or net realized
    gain. The calculation of net investment loss per share in the financial
    highlights excluded this adjustment. At September 30, 2003, the Fund's
    undistributed net realized gain on a tax basis was the same as accumulated
    net realized gain on investments.

       Pursuant to Section 852 of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund has
    designated $19,370,711 as a long-term capital gain distribution for its
    taxable year ended September 30, 2003.

    DISTRIBUTION POLICY

       The current distribution policy is to declare distributions in stock.
    Stock distributions will automatically be paid in newly issued shares of the
    Fund unless otherwise instructed by the

                                       15
<Page>

    shareholder. Pursuant to an SEC exemptive order, the Fund has implemented a
    fixed distribution policy that permits the Fund to make quarterly
    distributions at a rate of 2% of the Fund's net assets to shareholders of
    record. The Fund intends to use net realized capital gains when making
    quarterly distributions. This could result in a return of capital to
    shareholders if the amount of the distribution exceeds the Fund's net
    investment income and realized capital gains. It is anticipated that net
    realized capital gains in excess of the total distributed under this policy
    would be included in the December distribution.

    STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

       The cash amount shown in the Statement of Cash Flows is the amount
    included in the Fund's Statement of Assets and Liabilities and represents
    cash on hand at its custodian and does not include temporary cash
    investments at September 30, 2003.

(2) SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

       The aggregate cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment
    securities (other than temporary cash investments) for the year ended
    September 30, 2003 totaled $46,662,852 and $47,046,920, respectively.

       At September 30, 2003, the total cost of securities for Federal income
    tax purposes was $162,621,534. The net unrealized gain on securities held by
    the Fund was $29,117,048, including gross unrealized gain of $59,418,273 and
    gross unrealized loss of $30,301,225.

       At September 30, 2003, the Fund was committed to participate in a round
    of financing to purchase additional shares of restricted preferred stock for
    approximately $81,000. The Fund expects to satisfy this commitment in part
    through the conversion of a loan.

(3) INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

       The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement (the Advisory
    Agreement) with Hambrecht & Quist Capital Management LLC (the Adviser).
    Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser a
    monthly fee at the rate when annualized of (i) 2.5% of the average net
    assets for the month of its venture capital and other restricted securities
    up to 25% of net assets and (ii) for the month, for all other assets, 1.0%
    of the average net assets up to $250 million, 0.9% of the average net assets
    for the next $250 million, 0.8% of the average net assets for the next $500
    million and 0.7% of the average net assets thereafter. The aggregate fee may
    not exceed a rate when annualized of 1.375%. Certain officers and Trustees
    of the Fund are also officers of the Adviser.

       Trustees who are not affiliates of the Adviser receive an annual fee of
    $15,000 plus $1,500 for each meeting attended.

(4) VENTURE CAPITAL AND OTHER RESTRICTED SECURITIES

       The Fund may invest in venture capital and other restricted securities if
    these securities would currently comprise 40% or less of net assets. The
    value of these securities represents 22% of the Fund's net assets at
    September 30, 2003.

       The value of the venture capital and other restricted securities is
    determined in good faith by the Trustees. However, because of the inherent
    uncertainty of valuations, these estimated values may differ significantly
    from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the
    securities existed, and the differences could be material.

       During the year ended September 30, 2003, the Fund sold restricted
    securities for cash and a proportionate interest in a 5% interest-bearing
    promissory note due October 31, 2004. The Fund's interest in the note has a
    par value of $80,800 whose estimated value of $40,000 at September 30, 2003
    has also been determined by the Trustees and which is included in the
    Receivable for Investments Sold in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

ITEM 6.  [RESERVED]

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         A closed-end management investment company that is filing an annual
report on this Form N-CSR must, unless it invests exclusively in non-voting
securities, describe the policies and procedures that it uses to determine how
to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities, including the procedures that
the company uses when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of its
shareholders, on the one hand, and those of the company's investment adviser;
principal underwriter; or any affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)) and the rules
thereunder) of the company, its investment adviser, or its principal
underwriter, on the other. Include any policies and procedures of the company's
investment adviser, or any other third party, that the company uses, or that are
used on the company's behalf, to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.

THE REGISTRANT HAS ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:

<Page>

                    HAMBRECHT & QUIST CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC
                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
                                   April, 2003

The following are the policies and procedures adopted and implemented by
Hambrecht & Quist Capital Mangement LLC (the "Adviser") for voting proxies with
respect to portfolio securities held by H&Q Healthcare Investors and H&Q Life
Sciences Investors (each a "Fund" and collectively the "Funds"). The policies
and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that proxies are voted in the
best interest of the Funds and the Funds' shareholders, in accordance with the
Adviser's fiduciary duties and Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 (the "Investment Advisers Act"). The Adviser considers the "best
interests" of the Funds and their shareholders to mean their best long-term
economic interests.

I.      General Statement of Policies and Procedures.

The Adviser shall vote proxies for the exclusive benefit, and in the best
economic interest, of the Funds and their shareholders. Such exercise of voting
rights shall be subject to the same standard of care as is generally applicable
to the Adviser's performance of its duties, as set forth in the advisory
agreements with the Funds. The policies and procedures contained herein are
designed to be guidelines, however each vote is ultimately cast on a
case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the relevant facts and
circumstances at the time of the vote. Any material conflicts that may arise
will be resolved in the best interests of the Funds and their shareholders.

II.     Responsibility and Oversight.

A proxy committee is hereby designated and shall be responsible for
administering and overseeing the proxy voting process. The committee shall
consist of the President of the Adviser, the Treasurer of the Adviser, and the
analyst responsible for oversight of the company which is the subject of the
proxy.

III.    Proxy Voting Procedures.

        A.      Logistics. The Treasurer shall be responsible for maintaining
the proxy log, monitoring corporate actions and confirming the timely voting of
proxies. The proxy log shall contain the following information, in accordance
with Form N-PX:

                1.      the name of the issuer;

                2.      the exchange ticker symbol, if available;

                3.      the CUSIP number, if available;

                4.      the shareholder meeting date;

                5.      a brief identification of the matter voted on;

                6.      whether the matter was proposed by the issuer or a
                        security holder;

                7.      whether the Adviser cast its vote on the matter;

<Page>

                8.      how the Adviser cast its vote on the matter (for,
                        against, abstain; for or withhold regarding the election
                        of directors); and

                9.      whether the Adviser cast its vote for or against
                        management.

        B.      Substantive Voting Decisions.

The Adviser's substantive voting decisions turn on the particular facts and
circumstances of each proxy vote. The following is a list of common proxy vote
issues and the Adviser's standard considerations when determining how to vote
such proxies.

                1.      ROUTINE MATTERS/CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE ITEMS. After an
                        initial review, the Adviser generally votes with
                        management on routine matters related to the operation
                        of the issuer that are not expected to have a
                        significant economic impact on the issuer and/or its
                        shareholders.

                2.      POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT. The Adviser reviews
                        and analyzes on a case-by-case basis, non-routine
                        proposals that are more likely to affect the structure
                        and operation of the issuer and to have a greater impact
                        on the value of the investment.

                3.      CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. The Adviser reviews and considers
                        corporate governance issues related to proxy matters and
                        generally supports proposals that foster good corporate
                        governance practices.

                4.      SPECIAL INTEREST ISSUES. The Adviser considers: (i) the
                        long-term benefit to shareholders of promoting corporate
                        accountability and responsibility on social issues; (ii)
                        management's responsibility with respect to special
                        interest issues; (iii) any economic costs and
                        restrictions on management; and (iv) the responsibility
                        of the Adviser to vote proxies for the greatest
                        long-term shareholder value.

                5.      LIMITATIONS ON DIRECTOR TENURE AND RETIREMENT. The
                        Adviser considers: (i) a reasonable retirement age for
                        directors, E.G. 70 or 72; (ii) the introduction of new
                        perspectives on the board; and (iii) the arbitrary
                        nature of such limitations and the possibility of
                        detracting from the board's stability and continuity.

                6.      DIRECTORS' MINIMUM STOCK OWNERSHIP. The Adviser
                        considers: (i) the benefits of additional vested
                        interest; (ii) the ability of a director to serve a
                        company well regardless of the extent of his or her
                        share ownership; and (iii) the impact of limiting the
                        number of persons qualified to be directors.

                7.      D&O INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY PROTECTION. The
                        Adviser considers: (i) indemnifying directors for acts
                        conducted in the normal course of business; (ii)
                        limiting liability for monetary damages for violating
                        the duty of care; (iii) expanding coverage beyond legal
                        expenses to acts that represent more serious violations
                        of fiduciary obligation than carelessness (E.G.
                        negligence); and (iv) providing expanded coverage in
                        cases when a director's legal defense was

<Page>

                        unsuccessful if the director was found to have acted in
                        good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably
                        believed was in the best interests of the issuer.

                8.      DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS. The Adviser
                        considers: (i) long-term financial performance of the
                        issuer relative to its industry; (ii) management's track
                        record; (iii) background to proxy contest; (iv)
                        qualifications of both slates of nominees; (v)
                        evaluations of what each side is offering shareholders
                        as well as the likelihood that the proposed objectives
                        and goals can be met; and (vi) stock ownership
                        positions.

                9.      CUMULATIVE VOTING. The Adviser considers: (i) the
                        ability of significant stockholders to elect a director
                        of their choosing; (ii) the ability of minority
                        shareholders to concentrate their support in favor of a
                        director or directors of their choosing; and (iii) the
                        potential to limit the ability of directors to work for
                        all shareholders.

                10.     CLASSIFIED BOARDS. The Adviser considers: (i) providing
                        continuity; (ii) promoting long-term planning; and (iii)
                        guarding against unwanted takeovers.

                11.     POISON PILLS. The Adviser considers: (i) the Adviser's
                        position on supporting proposals to require a
                        shareholder vote on other shareholder rights plans; (ii)
                        ratifying or redeeming a poison pill in the interest of
                        protecting the value of the issuer; and (iii) other
                        alternatives to prevent a takeover at a price
                        demonstrably below the true value of the issuer.

                12.     FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS. The Adviser considers: (i) the
                        vote required to approve the proposed acquisition; (ii)
                        the vote required to repeal the fair price provision;
                        (iii) the mechanism for determining fair price; and (iv)
                        whether these provisions are bundled with other
                        anti-takeover measures (E.G., supermajority voting
                        requirements) that may entrench management and
                        discourage attractive tender offers.

                13.     EQUAL ACCESS. The Adviser considers: (i) the opportunity
                        for significant shareholders of the issuer to evaluate
                        and propose voting recommendations on proxy proposals
                        and director nominees, and to nominate candidates to the
                        board; and (ii) the added complexity and burden.

                14.     CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS. The Adviser considers: (i) the
                        potential benefits to shareholders; (ii) the potential
                        to detract the issuer's resources from more direct uses
                        of increasing shareholder value; and (iii) the
                        responsibility of shareholders to make individual
                        contributions.

                15.     STOCK AUTHORIZATIONS: The Adviser considers: (i) the
                        need for the increase; (ii) the percentage increase with
                        respect to the existing authorization; (iii) voting
                        rights of the stock; and (iv) overall capitalization
                        structures.

                16.     PREFERRED STOCK. The Adviser considers: (i) whether the
                        new class of preferred stock has unspecified voting,
                        conversion, dividend distribution, and other rights;

<Page>

                        (ii) whether the issuer expressly states that the stock
                        will not be used as a takeover defense or carry superior
                        voting rights; (iii) whether the issuer specifies the
                        voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such
                        stock and the terms of the preferred stock appear
                        reasonable; and (iv) whether the stated purpose is to
                        raise capital or make acquisitions in the normal course
                        of business.

                17.     DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. The Adviser considers: (i)
                        whether director shares are at the same market risk as
                        those of the shareholders; and (ii) how option programs
                        for outside directors compare with the standards of
                        internal programs.

                18.     GOLDEN AND TIN PARACHUTES. The Adviser considers: (i)
                        whether they will be submitted for shareholder approval;
                        and (ii) the employees covered by the plan and the
                        quality of management.

IV.     Limitations.

The Adviser may abstain from voting a proxy if it concludes that the effect on
shareholders' economic interests or the value of the portfolio holding is
indeterminable or insignificant. The Adviser may abstain from voting a proxy if
it concludes that the cost of voting is disproportionate to the economic impact
the vote would have on the portfolio holdings.

V.      Conflicts of Interest.

Where conflicts of interest arise between clients and the Adviser which cannot
be fully addressed by the process outlined above, the Adviser may convene an
ad-hoc committee which will meet to debate the conflict and to give a ruling on
a preferred course of action. The ad-hoc committee will be charged with
resolving the issue in a manner which will be in the best interests of the Funds
and their shareholders.

Alternatively, the Adviser may cause the proxies to be voted in accordance with
the recommendations of an independent third party service provider that the
Adviser may use to assist in voting proxies.

VI.     Disclosure.

The following disclosure shall be provided in connection with these policies and
procedures:

                1.      The Adviser shall provide a description or a copy of
                        these policies and procedures to the Boards of Trustees
                        of the Funds annually and upon request.

                2.      The Adviser shall make available to the Funds its proxy
                        voting records, for inclusion on the Funds' Form N-PX.

                3.      The Adviser shall include its proxy voting policies and
                        procedures in its annual filing on Form N-CSR.

                4.      The Adviser shall cause the Funds' shareholder reports
                        to include a statement that a copy of these policies and
                        procedures is available upon request (i) by

                        calling a toll-free number; (ii) on the Funds' website,
                        (if the Funds choose); and (iii) on the SEC's website.

                5.      The Adviser shall cause the Funds' annual and
                        semi-annual reports to include a statement that
                        information is available regarding how the Funds voted
                        proxies during the most recent twelve-month period (i)
                        without charge, upon request, either by calling a
                        toll-free number or on or through the Funds' website, or
                        both; and (ii) on the SEC's website.

VII.    Recordkeeping.

The Adviser shall maintain records of proxies voted in accordance with Section
204-2 of the Advisers Act, including proxy statements, a record of each vote
cast, and a copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to
making a decision of how to vote the proxy, or that memorializes the basis for
the Adviser's decision on how to vote the proxy. The Adviser shall also maintain
a copy of its policies and procedures and each written request from a client for
proxy voting records and the Adviser's written response to any client request,
either written or oral, for such records. Proxy statements that are filed on
EDGAR shall be considered maintained by the Adviser. All such records shall be
maintained for a period of five years in an easily accessible place, the first
two year in the offices of the Adviser.

                                 CODE OF ETHICS

I.      INTRODUCTION

The Board of Trustees of H&Q Life Sciences Investors and H&Q Healthcare
Investors (each, a "Fund") has established this Code of Ethics ("Code") in
accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated
thereunder. This Code does not supersede or otherwise affect the separate code
of ethics that the Fund and its investment adviser have adopted pursuant to Rule
17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("1940 Act").

This Code is designed to deter wrongdoing and promote: (i) honest and ethical
conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of
interest between personal and professional relationships; (ii) full, fair,
accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that
the Fund files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission
("SEC") and in other public communications made by the Fund; (iii) compliance
with applicable governmental laws, rules, and regulations; (iv) the prompt
internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate person or
persons; and (v) accountability for adherence to the Code. The Code applies to
the Fund's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief
Accounting Officer (collectively, "Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth
in Exhibit A). For the purposes of this Code, the Compliance Officer is the
Secretary of the Fund.

II.     PRINCIPLES OF HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT

        A.      GENERAL OBJECTIVES

The Fund expects all Covered Officers to adhere to the highest possible
standards of honest and ethical conduct. All Covered Officers are expected to
handle actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
professional relationships in a manner that is above reproach, and to place the
interests of the Fund above their own personal interests.

        B.      CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

All Covered Officers should be scrupulous in avoiding a conflict of interest
with regard to the Fund's interests. A conflict of interest occurs when an
individual's private interest interferes in any way -- or even appears to
interfere -- with the interests of the Fund. A conflict situation can arise when
a Covered Officer takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to
perform his or her work for the Fund objectively and effectively. Conflicts of
interest also arise when a Covered Officer, or a member of his or her family,
receives improper benefits as a result of his or her position with the Fund,
whether such benefits are received from the Fund or a third party. Any conflict
of interest that arises in a specific situation or transaction must be disclosed
by the Covered Officer and resolved before taking any action.

Conflicts of interest may not always be evident, and Covered Officers should
consult with the Compliance Officer or the Fund's legal counsel if they are
uncertain about any situation.

<Page>

Examples of possible conflicts of interest include:

                1.      OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT OR ACTIVITIES

Covered Officers may not engage in any outside employment or activity that
interferes with their performance or responsibilities to the Fund or is
otherwise in conflict with or prejudicial to the Fund. A Covered Officer must
disclose to the Compliance Officer any outside employment or activity that may
constitute a conflict of interest and obtain the Compliance Officer's approval
before engaging in any such employment or activity.

                2.      GIFTS

Covered Officers may not accept gifts or other items of more than de minimis
value from any person or entity that does business with or on behalf of the
Fund.

                3.      OTHER SITUATIONS

Because other conflicts of interest may arise, it would be impractical to
attempt to list all possible situations in this Code. If a proposed transaction
or situation raises any questions or doubts, a Covered Officer should consult
with the Compliance Officer or Fund counsel before engaging in the transaction
or activity.

        C.      CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES

Covered Officers may not exploit for their own personal gain, or for the
personal gain or their family members or relatives, opportunities that are
discovered through the use of Fund property, information, or position, unless
the opportunity is first disclosed fully in writing to the Board of Trustees and
the Board of Trustees declines to pursue such opportunity.

III.    FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY, AND UNDERSTANDABLE DISCLOSURE IN FUND
        DISCLOSURE AND REPORTING DOCUMENTS

As a registered investment company, it is of critical importance that the Fund's
public communications, reports, and filings contain full, fair, accurate,
timely, and understandable disclosure. Accordingly, Covered Officers are
expected to consider it central to their roles as officers of the Fund to
promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in the
Fund's public communications and reports, and in the documents that the Fund
files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

Depending on his or her position with the Fund, a Covered Officer may be called
upon to provide necessary information to make the Fund's public reports,
communications, and SEC filings and submissions complete, fair, and
understandable. The Fund expects Covered Officers to take this responsibility
very seriously and to provide prompt and accurate answers to inquiries related
to the Fund's public disclosure requirements. Covered Officers may be asked to
certify the accuracy of all responses and information provided for inclusion in
the Fund's public reports, communications, and SEC filings and submissions.

IV.     COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE GOVERNMENTAL RULES AND REGULATIONS

As a registered investment company, the Fund is subject to regulation by the SEC
and must comply with Federal securities laws and regulations, as well as other
applicable laws. The Fund insists on strict compliance with the spirit and the
letter of these laws and regulations. Each Covered Officer shall cooperate with
Fund counsel, the Fund's independent accountants, and the Fund's other service
providers

                                        2
<Page>

with the goal of maintaining the Fund's material compliance with applicable
governmental rules and regulations.

The Fund expects its Covered Officers to comply with all laws, rules, and
regulations applicable to the Fund's operations and business. Covered Officers
should seek guidance whenever they are in doubt as to the applicability of any
law, rule, or regulation, or regarding any contemplated course of action.
Covered Officers should also make use of the various guidelines which the Fund
and its service providers have prepared on specific laws and regulations. If in
doubt on a course of action, a good guideline is "always ask first, act later"
- -- if you are unsure of what to do in any situation, seek guidance before you
act.

Covered Officers are encouraged to attend courses and seminars for the purpose
of keeping themselves apprised of developments relating to those governmental
statutes, rules, and regulations applicable to the Fund.

Upon obtaining knowledge of any material violation of any applicable law, rule,
or regulation by the Fund or a person acting with or on behalf of the Fund, a
Covered Officer shall report such violation to the Compliance Officer, Fund
counsel, or both. (See Section VI of the Code for a discussion of reporting Code
violations.) Each Covered Officer shall cooperate or take such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to remedy any such material violation.

V.      CONFIDENTIALITY

Covered Officers must maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to
them by the Fund, except when disclosure is authorized by Fund counsel or
required by laws or regulations. Whenever possible, Covered Officers should
consult with Fund counsel if they believe they have a legal obligation to
disclose confidential information. Confidential information includes all
non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the
Fund or its shareholders, if disclosed. The obligation to preserve confidential
information continues even after employment as a Covered Officer ends.

VI.     PROMPT INTERNAL REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE; EVALUATION OF
        POSSIBLE VIOLATIONS; DETERMINATION OF SANCTIONS

        A.      REPORTING TO COMPLIANCE OFFICER. A Covered Officer shall
promptly report knowledge of, or information concerning, any material violation
of this Code to the Compliance Officer. Any such report shall be in writing, and
shall describe in reasonable detail the conduct that such Covered Officer
believes to have violated this Code. The Compliance Officer shall also have the
authority to draft a report of a suspected material violation of the Code, if no
written report is made by a Covered Officer.

        B.      EVALUATION OF REPORTS. The Compliance Officer shall then consult
with Fund counsel to the extent necessary to determine whether the reported
conduct actually violates the Code. If it is determined that there has been a
violation of the Code, the Compliance Officer will determine (in consultation
with Fund counsel) whether the violation has had or may have, in the reasonable
judgment of the Compliance Officer, a material adverse impact upon the Fund.

                1.      NO MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FUND. If the
Compliance Officer determines that the violation has not caused a material
adverse impact upon the Fund, the Compliance Officer shall determine what
sanctions, if any, may be appropriate for the violation. (See Section VIII of
the Code for a discussion of possible sanctions.)

                2.      MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE FUND. If the Compliance
Officer determines that the violation has caused a material adverse impact upon
the Fund, the Compliance Officer shall promptly notify the Board of such
violation. The Board shall be entitled to consult with independent legal counsel
to determine whether the violation actually has had a material adverse impact
upon the Fund; to formulate

                                        3
<Page>

sanctions, if any, appropriate for the violation; or for any other purpose that
the Board, in its business judgment, determines to be necessary or advisable.
(See Section VIII of the Code for a discussion of possible sanctions.)

        C.      PERIODIC REPORTS BY COMPLIANCE OFFICER TO BOARD OF TRUSTEES. The
Compliance Officer shall report to the Board at each regularly scheduled Board
meeting all violations of this Code (whether or not they caused a material
adverse impact upon the Fund) and all sanctions imposed.

VII.    WAIVERS OF PROVISIONS OF THE CODE

        A.      WAIVERS. A Covered Officer may request a waiver of a provision
                of this Code if there is a reasonable likelihood that a
                contemplated action would be a material departure from a
                provision of the Code. Waivers will not be granted except under
                extraordinary or special circumstances.

                The process of requesting a waiver shall consist of the
                following steps:

                        a.      The Covered Officer shall set forth a request
                                for waiver in writing and submit such request to
                                the Compliance Officer. The request shall
                                describe the conduct, activity, or transaction
                                for which the Covered Officer seeks a waiver,
                                and shall briefly explain the reason for
                                engaging in the conduct, activity, or
                                transaction.

                        b.      The determination with respect to the waiver
                                shall be made in a timely fashion by the
                                Compliance Officer, in consultation with Fund
                                counsel, and submitted to the Board for
                                ratification.

                        c.      The decision with respect to the waiver request
                                shall be documented and kept in the Fund's
                                records for the appropriate period mandated by
                                applicable law or regulation.

        B.      DISCLOSURE OF WAIVERS. To the extent required by applicable law,
                waivers (including "implicit waivers") shall be publicly
                disclosed on a timely basis. An "implicit waiver" is defined as
                the Fund's failure to take action within a reasonable period of
                time regarding a material departure from a provision of the Code
                that has been made known to an "executive officer" of the Fund.
                For this purpose, an "executive officer" is a Fund's President
                or Chief Executive Officer, Vice President (who is in charge of
                a principal policymaking function), or any other person who
                performs similar policymaking functions for the Fund. For the
                purpose of determining whether an "implicit waiver" has
                occurred, if a material departure from a provision of the Code
                is known only by the Covered Officer who has caused the material
                departure, the material departure will not be considered to have
                been made known to an executive officer of the Fund.

VIII.   ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ADHERENCE TO THE CODE

The matters covered in this Code are of the utmost importance to the Fund and
its shareholders, and are essential to the Fund's ability to conduct its
business in accordance with its stated values. Covered Officers are expected to
adhere to these rules in carrying out their duties for the Fund.

The Fund will, if appropriate, take action against any Covered Officer whose
actions are found to violate this Code. Sanctions for violations of the Code may
include, among other things, a requirement that the violator undergo training
related to the violation, a letter of sanction, the imposition of a monetary
penalty, and/or suspension or termination of the employment of the violator.
Where the Fund has

                                        4
<Page>

suffered a loss because of violations of this Code or applicable laws,
regulations, or rules, it may pursue its remedies against the individuals or
entities responsible.

IX.     RECORDKEEPING

        A.      GENERAL. The Fund requires accurate recording and reporting of
information in order to make responsible business decisions. All of the Fund's
books, records, accounts and financial statements must be maintained in
reasonable detail, must appropriately reflect the Fund's transactions and must
conform both to applicable legal requirements and to the Fund's system of
internal controls.

        B.      CODE OF ETHICS RECORDS. A copy of this Code, any amendments
hereto, and any reports or other records created in relation to waivers of or
amendments to provisions of this Code shall be kept as records of the Fund for
six years from the end of the fiscal year in which such document was created.
Such records shall be furnished to the SEC or its staff upon request.

X.      AMENDMENTS TO THE CODE

The Covered Officers and the Compliance Officer are encouraged to recommend
improvements to this Code to the Board, and the Board may amend the Code in its
discretion. In connection with any amendment to the Code, the Compliance Officer
shall prepare a brief description of the amendment, in order that this
description may be disclosed in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

               affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
               reporting; and
