LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN

[PHOTO]

R. Jay Gerken
R. Jay Gerken, CFA
Chairman

Dear Shareholder,
The Salomon Brothers Global High Income Fund Inc. began operations at the end
of July 2003 during a tumultuous time in the global bond markets. Volatility in
the U.S. Treasury bond market and uncertainty over the Federal Reserve Bank's
("Fed") next interest rate move triggered the volatility, pushing bond yields
higher, particularly toward the end of the 12 months ended May 31, 2004. For
example, bond markets got off to a relatively strong start in spring 2003, as
the economy was still in a relatively sluggish state and interest rates were
still declining. However, bond prices retreated through the early summer,
following comments from the Fed about its monetary policy and data suggesting a
recent pick-up in economic activity. At the close of summer 2003, the broader
bond markets stabilized, and bonds traded in a relatively narrower range in the
fall.

The last six months of the period were relatively more stable as the economy
showed strong signs of a turnaround, with growth in third quarter gross
domestic product ("GDP")/i/ coming in extremely strong at 8.2%. Nevertheless,
despite the strength of the economy, the Fed held fast to its 1% short-term
lending rate, attributing the economic growth more to increases in productivity
than to jobs. Yields began to rise again during April and May of 2004, buoyed
by strong job numbers and the Fed's increasingly more conservative stance
toward inflation.

Emerging markets and high yield debt rallied somewhat through the fall and
winter of 2003. However, through the first five months of 2004, comments from
the Fed about the improvement in the economy, coupled with stronger reports on
job growth late in the period and a pick-up in inflation, generated more
pronounced concerns about interest rates. As a result, bond prices pulled back
significantly, particularly toward the end of the first and during the second
calendar quarters.

Please read on for a more detailed look at prevailing economic and market
conditions during the fund's fiscal year and to learn how those conditions and
changes made to the portfolio during this time may have affected fund
performance.

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests
and investigations.

In November 2003, Citigroup Asset Management disclosed an investigation by the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the U.S. Attorney relating to
Citigroup Asset Management's entry into the transfer agency business during
1997-1999. On July 20, 2004, Citigroup disclosed that it had been notified by
the Staff of the SEC that the Staff is considering recommending a civil
injunctive action and/or an administrative proceeding against certain advisory
and transfer agent entities affiliated with Citigroup relating to the creation
and operation of its internal transfer agent unit to serve primarily the Smith
Barney family of mutual funds. This internal transfer agent did not provide
services to the fund. Citigroup is cooperating with the SEC and will seek to
resolve this matter in discussion with the SEC Staff. Although there can be no
assurance, Citigroup does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect on the fund.

MANAGER OVERVIEW

Performance Review

Since the fund's inception on July 28, 2003, to the end of the reporting period
ended May 31, 2004, the fund returned -1.63% based on its New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") market price and 8.44% based on its net asset value
("NAV")/ii/ per share. The fund's unmanaged benchmark, the Lehman Brothers
Aggregate Bond Index/iii/ returned 3.23% and the fund's Lipper global income
closed-end funds category average was 8.72% during the time period from July
31, 2003 to May 31, 2004./iv/ Please note that Lipper performance returns are
based on each fund's NAV.

During the 10-month period, the fund made distributions to shareholders
totaling $1.03 per share, including a special dividend to investors in December
2003. The performance table shows the fund's 30-day SEC and annualized
distribution yields, as well as approximately the 10-month total return based
on its NAV and market price as of May 31, 2004. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. The fund's yields will vary.


                      FUND PERFORMANCE AS OF MAY 31, 2004

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                30-Day  Annualized
                 SEC   Distribution 7/28/03-5/31/04
Price Per Share Yield     Yield      Total Return
<S>             <C>    <C>          <C>
 $14.50 (NAV)   7.76%     8.79%         8.44%
 $13.76 (NYSE)  7.36%     9.27%         -1.63%
</TABLE>

  All figures represent past performance and are no guarantee of future
  results. The fund's yields will vary.

  Total returns are based on changes in NAV or market price, respectively.
  Total returns assume the reinvestment of all dividends and/or capital gains
  distributions, if any, in additional shares. Annualized distribution yield is
  the fund's current monthly income dividend rate, annualized, and then divided
  by the NAV or the market price noted in this report. The "SEC yield" is a
  return figure often quoted by bond and other fixed income mutual funds. This
  quotation is based on the most recent 30-day (or one month) period covered by
  the fund's filings with the SEC. The yield figure reflects the dividends and
  interest earned during the period after deduction of the fund's expenses for
  the period. The annualized distribution yield assumes a current monthly
  income dividend rate of $0.10625 for 12 months. These yields are as of May
  31, 2004 and are subject to change.


Investment-Grade Debt

The performance of the bond market over the past year has been strongly linked
to anticipated actions of the Fed and its accompanying economic data. In June,
the Fed, concerned about deflation and looking to lift the economy, set their
Federal funds target rate at 1%; it's lowest level in 45 years. This move
initially caused short-term rates to fall, but signs of stronger economic
growth soon started to boost yields dramatically. Five-year Treasury yields
rose more than 125 basis points/v/ from their mid-June lows to end-July highs,
and ten-year yields reached their highs for the year. Volatility ensued in
September when the Fed made it clear that they had little or no intention of
raising rates for a "considerable period" due to soft growth and inflation
levels that appeared to be fully in check. This caused five-year yields to fall
nearly 65 basis points. The next six months were relatively stable as the
economy showed signs of a turnaround with a very strong third quarter GDP of
8.2%. Nevertheless, despite the strength of the economy, the Fed held fast to
its 1% short-term lending rate, attributing the economic growth more to
increases in productivity than to jobs.

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND INC.


Signs of inflation and strong non-farm payroll numbers began to appear in March
and April of 2004. Strong job numbers combined with inflation fighting language
from the Fed, led to another rise in Treasury yields, with ten-year yields
rising over 100 basis points from their early March lows. By the end of May,
the market had priced in a 25-basis-point increase in the Fed funds rate,
anticipating that tightening will begin in June.

U.S. High-Yield Debt

The U.S. high-yield bond market, as represented by the Citigroup High Yield
Market Index/vi/ ("High Yield Index"), returned 8.80%, from the time period of
July 28, 2003 to May 31, 2004. During the autumn, the high-yield market
regained the momentum it lost over the summer, amid July's volatility in the
U.S. Treasury bond market. Throughout much of the reporting period, the
high-yield market advanced amid record inflows into high-yield funds as U.S.
Treasury bond prices stabilized. Fundamentals also supported the market as many
companies generated better-than-expected earnings and default rates continued
to decline substantially compared to 2002. Additionally, increased capital
market transactions fortified the balance sheets of corporate bond issuers in
the healthier economic environment.

Following a strong run over 2003, high-yield bond prices began to retreat in
late January due to profit taking, as investors became concerned that company
fundamentals did not warrant such gains and the low yields did not offer enough
compensation for the risk. The high-yield market continued to decline in
February, with lower-quality issues leading the way down amid large fund
outflows, continued profit taking, and greater focus on company fundamentals.
In March, investors sought haven in higher-rated bonds in the
non-investment-grade universe, as terrorism fears and weak employment numbers
exerted pressure on stock markets and drove yields on U.S. Treasury bonds lower.

However, economic data released in April showing an improving labor market, and
signs of higher inflation sparked another sell-off in U.S. Treasury bonds, as
investors shifted their expectations of Fed tightening from 2005 to the summer
of 2004. Additionally, economic data in May sparked increased inflation fears,
with concern over Fed tightening transitioning from timing to size and pace of
the expected interest rate increases (although projections, which are subject
to change, varied among investors and no one can say for sure when rates will
rise). Once again, the volatility in the U.S. Treasury market spilled into the
high-yield market, resulting in negative returns and large mutual fund net
redemptions.

Competitive Yields

Based on the 8.46% yield of the High Yield Index as of May 31, 2004, high-yield
bonds continued to offer competitive yields relative to U.S. Treasury notes.
However, high-yield issues are subject to additional risks, such as the
increased possibility of default because of their lower credit quality, and
yields and prices will fluctuate.

Following a strong run over 2003, the high-yield bond market has not rallied as
significantly during 2004 due to recent valuations and the back-up in U.S.
Treasuries. However, the recent improvement in the U.S. economy has proved
favorable for corporate earnings and the corporate bond credit environment.
While markets will fluctuate, the high-yield market has remained healthy from a
fundamental perspective. The fund remained overweight in lower-rated
securities, based upon our rationale that the fund could benefit from an
improving economy and potentially outperform higher-rated quality credits if
interest rates were to rise.

Emerging Markets Debt

Emerging markets debt, as represented by the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond
Index Plus/vii/ ("EMBI+"), returned 4.36% for the period from July 28, 2003
through May 31, 2004. After a 10-month rally, the emerging markets debt market
temporarily came to a halt in late June following a sell-off of U.S. Treasury
bonds. In July, U.S. Treasury bond prices fell further following a report
stating that economic growth had sharply accelerated, which prompted investors
to question if the Fed's rate-cutting cycle had run its course. However,
sovereign debt markets rebounded through the fall and early winter, as Treasury
markets stabilized and investors refocused their attention on the strong
fundamentals in improving emerging market economies.

The emerging debt markets started 2004 strong, as markets remained generally
calm amid a relatively benign stretch in the U.S. Treasury bond markets and
hedge funds joined crossover buyers in adding to their emerging markets debt
allocations. Emerging markets were disrupted again in April after U.S. Treasury
bonds sold off and yields rose following an extremely strong March U.S. jobs
report and comments from the Fed about the economy and inflation concerns in
the U.S. April saw the EMBI+'s largest sell-off since July of 2001, with
sovereign spreads/viii/ over U.S. Treasuries widening to levels not seen since
October of last year. This sell-off was driven almost entirely by technical
factors, as many traders reacted to the upward interest rate pressure by
selling their emerging markets debt positions in an effort to take profits,
unwind existing leveraged positions and decrease their overall risk.

Through all of this, emerging markets debt fundamentals remained strong, and
the markets benefited from increasing signs of a global economic turnaround.
Continued strength in commodity prices, including metals, agriculture and oil,
provided positive support for many emerging market countries. Oil prices, in
particular, remained high, favoring oil exporters, but fears remained that high
energy prices might dampen the global recovery. Revenues from oil production
contributed to positive performance in Ecuador, Russia and Venezuela.

Spreads tightened during the 12-month period ended May 31, 2004, closing at 508
basis points over U.S. Treasuries. Over the same period, 12-month return
volatility stood at 8.73%,/ix/ substantially below long-term historical levels
of 16%.

Factors Influencing Fund Performance

We began the period, starting with the fund's inception in late July 2003, with
a relatively conservative investment-grade position of about 17.4%,
concentrated primarily in U.S. mortgages. However, the fund increased its
investment-grade allocations after September, which was a weak month for
mortgages, and was rewarded with five months of strong duration-adjusted
returns over U.S. Treasuries. Returns began to slow in March and April in
response to upward interest rate pressure and rising Treasury yields resulting
from the months' strong job reports, which were seen as potentially
inflationary. Nevertheless, the increased allocation to safer investment-grade
debt away from higher-yielding assets added to the period's performance and
stability. We also added an allocation to non-U.S. investment-grade debt, which
outperformed its domestic counterpart, to take advantage of tactical
opportunities and increase diversification within the investment-grade portion
of the portfolio. As the probability for rising rates remained within the U.S.,
this non-U.S. allocation proved less rate sensitive and, thus, contributed to
total returns throughout the period.

The top-performing sectors in the high yield portion of the portfolio for the
period included automotive, cable, communication towers, consumer products and
restaurants. The most significant underperforming sectors included airlines,
broadcast/outdoor, healthcare, homebuilders and satellites. The portfolio
benefited from overweighting lower quality issues and the communications towers,

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND INC.


consumer products and restaurant sectors, and underweighting in the airline,
homebuilder and satellite sectors. The portfolio's exposure to an overweighting
in the healthcare sector and underweightings in the automotive and utilities
sectors detracted from performance. We added to the fund's positions in issues
rated CCC and in the chemicals, communication towers, consumer products,
containers and metals/mining sectors, and reduced the fund's exposure to the
cable, food/beverages, gaming and wireless sectors. We reduced our allocations
to high-yield by approximately 9.0%, since the inception of the fund in late
July 2003 through the end of the period.

Our initial investment of approximately 40% in emerging markets debt at the
fund's inception positively contributed to performance for the period, as it
enabled us to benefit from maximum exposure to emerging markets for the
majority of the rally following the July sell-off. While we maintained our
positive outlook on emerging markets debt throughout the period, during the
first quarter of 2004, we significantly reduced our emerging markets debt
exposure in the fund to slightly less than 25% of the total portfolio based on
our forecast of increased volatility in the emerging markets. The fund's early
overweights in Ecuador and Brazil were strong contributors to outperformance
for the majority of the period, but detracted slightly during the last three
months, as Brazil and Ecuador led the asset class' sell-off. The fund's
longstanding underweight in Argentina and tactical underweight in Russia
positively contributed to performance as Argentine and Russian debt
underperformed the market through the period. Fund performance was also
positively impacted by the use of leverage./x/

Sector rotation between investment grade, high yield and emerging markets debt
was key to the fund's outperformance during the period. Specifically, the
tactical shift out of emerging markets debt, primarily into U.S.
mortgage-backed and non-U.S. investment grade securities, limited the impact of
the sell-off in emerging markets in 2004 and significantly reduced the fund's
exposure to credit risk. Such rotation also increased the fund's exposure to
the U.S. mortgage market, which benefited from low interest rates through the
period. We have maintained the duration of this portfolio less than four years
since inception. The fund's NAV performed positively in response to our active
sector management, reaching above its initial level by the close of the period.

from those of the firm as a whole.
RISKS: An investment in the fund is subject to investment risk, including the
possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest. The fund may use
derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may
disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on fund
performance. Investing in foreign securities is subject to certain risks not
associated with domestic investing, such as currency fluctuations, and changes
in political and economic conditions. These risks are magnified in emerging or
developing markets. High yield bonds involve greater credit and liquidity risks
than investment grade bonds. Investments in small capitalization companies may
involve a higher degree of risk and volatility than investments in larger, more
established companies. Leverage may magnify gains and increase losses in the
fund's portfolio.

SALOMON BROTHERS GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND INC.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Salomon Brothers Global High Income Fund Inc. ("Fund") was incorporated in
Maryland and is registered as a non-diversified, closed-end, management
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The
Fund seeks to maintain a high level of current income by investing primarily in
a portfolio of high-yield fixed income securities issued by corporate issuers,
emerging market fixed income securities and investment grade fixed income
securities. As a secondary objective, the Fund seeks total return.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual
amounts could differ from those estimates.

(a) SECURITIES VALUATION. In valuing the Fund's assets, all securities for
which market quotations are readily available are valued (i) at the last sale
price prior to the time of determination if there were a sale on the date of
determination, (ii) at the mean between the last current bid and asked prices
if there were no sales on such date and bid and asked quotations are available,
and (iii) at the bid price if there were no sales price on such date and only
bid quotations are available. Publicly traded foreign government debt
securities are typically traded internationally in the over-the-counter market,
and are valued at the mean between the last current bid and asked price as of
the close of business of that market. However, when the spread between bid and
asked price exceeds five percent of the par value of the security, the security
is valued at the bid price. Securities may also be valued by independent
pricing services which use prices provided by market-makers or estimates of
market values obtained from yield data relating to instruments or securities
with similar characteristics. Short-term investments having a maturity of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value.
Securities for which reliable quotations are not readily available and all
other securities and assets are valued at fair value as determined in good
faith by, or under procedures established by, the Board of Directors.

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS. Investment transactions are recorded on the trade
date. Interest income is accrued on a daily basis. Market discount or premium
on securities purchased is accreted or amortized, respectively, on an effective
yield basis over the life of the security. The Fund uses the specific
identification method for determining realized gain or loss on investments.
Dividend income is recorded on ex-dividend date.

(c) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The books and records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. Portfolio securities and other assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollar
amounts at the date of valuation using the 12:00 noon rate of exchange reported
by Reuters. Purchases and sales of portfolio securities and income and expense
items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at
rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Net
realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions represent net gains
and losses from sales and maturities of forward currency contracts, disposition
of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized between the trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions and the difference between the
amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollar equivalent amount actually
received. The Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses on
investments which is due to changes in foreign exchange rates from that which
is due to changes in market prices of the securities. Such fluctuations are
included with the net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.
However, pursuant to U.S. federal income tax regulations, certain net foreign
exchange gains/losses included in realized gain/loss are included in or are a
reduction of ordinary income for federal income tax purposes.

(d) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. The Fund has complied and intends to continue to
comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies, and to distribute all of its
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required. The character of income and gains to be distributed is determined in
accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

(e) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS. The Fund declares and pays dividends to
shareholders monthly from net investment income. Net realized gains, if any, in
excess of loss carryovers are expected to be distributed at least annually.
Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. The amount of dividends and distributions from net investment income and
net realized gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax
regulations, which may differ from GAAP. To the extent these differences are
permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the components of net
assets. Dividends and distributions which exceed net investment income and net
realized capital gains for tax purposes are reported as a tax return of capital.

(f) REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. When entering into repurchase agreements, it is the
Fund's policy that a custodian takes possession of the underlying collateral
securities, the value of which at least equals the principal amount of the
repurchase transaction, including accrued interest. To the extent that any
repurchase transaction exceeds one business day, the value of the collateral is
marked-to-market to ensure the adequacy of the collateral. If the seller
defaults and the value of the collateral declines or if bankruptcy proceedings
are commenced with respect to the seller of the security, realization of the
collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.


                                                                        Page 23

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

(g) CASH FLOW INFORMATION. The Fund invests in securities and distributes
dividends from net investment income and net realized gains which are paid in
cash and may be reinvested at the discretion of shareholders. These activities
are reported in the statement of changes in net assets and additional
information on cash receipts and cash payments is presented in the statement of
cash flows.

(h) YEAR END TAX RECLASSIFICATIONS. The character of income and gains to be
distributed is determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. At May 31, 2004,
reclassifications were made to the Fund's capital accounts to reflect permanent
book/tax differences and income and gains available for distributions under
income tax regulations. Accordingly, a portion of paid-in capital amounting to
$43,869 has been reclassified to undistributed net investment income. Net
investment income, net realized gains and net assets were not affected by this
change.

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS

Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc ("SBAM"), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment manager to the
Fund. SBAM is responsible on a day-to-day basis for the management of the
Fund's portfolio in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives and
policies and for making decisions to buy, sell or hold particular securities of
the Fund. The management fee for these services is payable monthly at an annual
rate of 0.85% of the Fund's average daily net assets plus the proceeds of any
outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

In connection with SBAM's service as investment manager to the Fund, Citigroup
Asset Management Ltd. ("CAM Ltd."), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Citigroup, will provide certain advisory services to SBAM relating to currency
transactions and investments in non-dollar-denominated debt securities for the
benefit of the Fund pursuant to a sub-advisory consulting agreement. SBAM will
pay CAM Ltd. a fee for its services at no additional expense to the Fund.

During periods in which the Fund is utilizing financial leverage, the fee which
is payable to SBAM as a percentage of the Fund's assets will be higher than if
the Fund did not utilize leverage because the fee is calculated as a percentage
of the Fund's assets, including those investments purchased with leverage.

At May 31, 2004, Citigroup Financial Products Inc., an affiliate of SBAM and an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup, held 6,995 shares of the Fund.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are also officers and/or
directors of SBAM.

NOTE 4. FUTURES CONTRACTS

Securities or cash equal to the initial margin amount are either deposited with
the broker or segregated by the custodian upon entering into the futures
contract. Additional securities are also segregated up to the current market
value of the futures contracts. During the period the futures contract is open,
changes in the value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or
losses by "marking to market" on a daily basis to reflect the market value of
the contract at the end of each day's trading. Variation margin payments are
received or made and recognized as assets due from or liabilities due to
broker, depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. When
the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the
difference between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transactions and
the Fund's basis in the contract. The Fund enters into such contracts typically
to hedge a portion of its portfolio. The Fund bears the market risk that arises
from changes in the value of the financial instruments and securities indices.

At May 31, 2004, the Fund had the following open futures contracts:

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)


NOTE 5. FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

A forward foreign currency contract is an agreement between two parties to buy
and sell a currency at a set price on a future date. The contract is
marked-to-market daily and the change in value is recorded by the Fund as an
unrealized gain or loss. When a forward foreign currency contract is
extinguished, through either delivery or offset by entering into another
forward foreign currency contract, the Fund records a realized gain or loss
equal to the difference between the value of the contract at the time it was
opened and the value of the contract at the time it was extinguished or offset.
The Fund bears the market risk that arises from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and the credit risk should a counterparty fail to meet the terms
of such contracts.

At May 31, 2004, the Fund had open forward foreign currency contracts as
described below. The unrealized loss on the contracts reflected in the
accompanying financial statements were as follows:
<TABLE>

</TABLE>

NOTE 6. REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

The Fund may enter into reverse repurchase agreements in which the Fund sells
portfolio securities and agrees to repurchase them from the buyer at a
particular date and price. Whenever the Fund enters into a reverse repurchase
agreement, the custodian delivers liquid assets in an amount at least equal to
the repurchase price marked-to-market daily (including accrued interest), and
subsequently monitors the account to ensure that such equivalent value is
maintained. The Fund pays interest on amounts obtained pursuant to reverse
repurchase agreements. Reverse repurchase agreements are considered to be
borrowings by the Fund. Reverse repurchase agreements involve leverage risk and
the risk that the market value of securities retained by the Fund may decline
below the repurchase price of the securities sold by the Fund which it is
obligated to repurchase. Transactions in reverse repurchase agreements for the
Fund during the period ended May 31, 2004 were as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                       Average     Weighted      Maximum

</TABLE>

The interest rate on reverse repurchase agreements was 0.90% during the period
ended May 31, 2004. Interest expense on reverse repurchase agreements totaled
$95,500.

At May 31, 2004, the Fund did not have any open reverse repurchase agreements.

NOTE 7. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund enters into dollar rolls in which the Fund sells mortgage-backed
securities for delivery in the current month and simultaneously contracts to
repurchase substantially similar (same type, coupon and maturity) securities to
settle on a specified future date. During the roll period, the Fund forgoes
principal and interest paid on the securities. The Fund is compensated by a fee
paid by the counterparty. Dollar rolls are accounted for as financing
arrangements; the fee is accrued into interest income ratably over the term of
the dollar roll and any gain or loss on the roll is deferred and realized upon
disposition of the rolled security. For the period ended May 31, 2004, the Fund
recorded interest income of $3,386,640 related to such dollar rolls. Dollar
roll transactions involve the risk that the market value of the securities sold
by the Fund may decline below the repurchase price of the similar securities.

The average monthly balance of mortgage dollar rolls outstanding during the
period ended May 31, 2004 was $113,802,801. At May 31, 2004, the Fund had
outstanding mortgage dollar rolls with a total cost of $204,712,501.
Counterparties with mortgage dollar rolls outstanding in excess of 10% of total
net assets at May 31, 2004 included J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. ($64,831,056) and
Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. ($61,649,028).

NOTE 8. SECURITIES TRADED ON A TO-BE-ANNOUNCED BASIS

The Fund may trade securities on a to-be-announced ("TBA") basis. In a TBA
transaction, the Fund commits to purchasing or selling securities for which
specific information is not yet known at the time of the trade, particularly
the face amount and maturity date in Government National Mortgage Association
("GNMA") transactions. Securities purchased on a TBA basis are not settled
until they are delivered to the Fund, normally 15 to 45 days later. Beginning
on the date the Fund enters into a TBA transaction, cash, U.S. government
securities or other liquid high grade debt obligations are segregated in an
amount equal in value to the purchase price of the TBA security. These
transactions are subject to market fluctuations and their current value is
determined in the same manner as for other securities.

At May 31, 2004, the Fund held TBA securities with a total cost of $204,712,501.

NOTE 9. LOAN PARTICIPATIONS

The Fund invests in fixed and floating rate loans arranged through private
negotiations between a foreign sovereign entity and one or more financial
institutions. The Fund's investment in any such loan may be in the form of a
participation in or an assignment of the loan.

In connection with purchasing participations, the Fund generally will have no
right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan
agreement relating to the loan, nor any

                                                                        Page 27

<PAGE>


SALOMON BROTHERS GLOBAL HIGH INCOME FUND INC.


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

rights of set-off against the borrower, and the Fund may not benefit directly
from any collateral supporting the loan in which it has purchased the
participation. As a result, the Fund will assume the credit risk of both the
borrower and the lender that is selling the participation. In the event of the
insolvency of the lender selling the participation, the Fund may be treated as
a general creditor of the lender and may not benefit from any set-off between
the lender and the borrower.

At May 31, 2004, the Fund held loan participations with a total cost of
$4,934,721 and a total market value of $4,981,722.

NOTE 10. CREDIT RISK

The yields of emerging markets debt obligations and high-yield corporate debt
obligations reflect, among other things, perceived credit risk. The Fund's
investment in securities rated below investment grade typically involves risks
not associated with higher rated securities including, among others, overall
greater risk of timely and ultimate payment of interest and principal, greater
market price volatility and less liquid secondary market trading. The
consequences of political, social, economic or diplomatic changes may have
disruptive effects on the market prices of investments held by the Fund.

NOTE 11. FOREIGN SECURITIES

Investing in securities of foreign companies and foreign governments involves
special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing in
U.S. companies and the U.S. government. These risks include revaluation of
currencies and future adverse political and economic developments. Moreover,
securities of many foreign companies and foreign governments and their markets
may be less liquid and their prices more volatile than those of securities of
comparable U.S. companies and the U.S. government.

NOTE 12. LOAN

At May 31, 2004, the Fund had outstanding a $100,000,000 loan pursuant to a
revolving credit and security agreement with Three Pillars Funding Corp. and
Citicorp North America Inc. ("CNA"), an affiliate of SBAM. In addition, CNA
acts as administrative agent. The loans generally bear interest at a variable
rate based on the weighted average interest rates of the underlying commercial
paper or LIBOR, plus any applicable margin. Securities held by the Fund are
subject to a lien, granted to the lenders, to the extent of the borrowing
outstanding and any additional expenses. For the period ended May 31, 2004, the
Fund paid interest expense on this loan of $1,101,029.

NOTE 13. DIVIDENDS SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2004

On May 14, 2004, the Board of Directors ("Board") of the Fund declared three
dividends from net investment income, each in the amount of $0.10625 per share,
payable on June 25, 2004, July 30, 2004 and August 27, 2004 to shareholders of
record on June 15, 2004, July 13, 2004 and August 17, 2004, respectively.

NOTE 14. CAPITAL SHARES

On October 22, 2003, the Fund's Board authorized the Fund to repurchase from
time to time in the open market up to 3,000,000 shares of the Fund's common
stock. The Board directed the management of the Fund to repurchase shares of
the Fund's common stock at such times and in such amounts as management
believes will enhance shareholder value, subject to review by the Fund's Board.
As of May 31, 2004 the Fund has not repurchased any shares since the inception
of the repurchase plan.

NOTE 15. CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARD

The Fund had $2,700,406 of capital losses realized after October 31, 2003,
which were deferred for tax purposes to the first day of the following fiscal
year.

NOTE 16. INCOME TAX INFORMATION AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

At May 31, 2004, the tax basis components of distributable earnings were:

<TABLE>
                   <S>                           <C>

</TABLE>

At May 31, 2004, the difference between book basis and tax basis unrealized
appreciation and depreciation was attributable primarily to wash sale loss
deferrals and mark to market of derivative contracts.

The tax character of distributions paid during the period ended May 31, 2004
was:

                                          ===========
</TABLE>

NOTE 17. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Citigroup has been notified by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") that the Staff is considering recommending a civil
injunctive action and/or an administrative proceeding against Citigroup Asset
Management ("CAM"), including its applicable investment advisory companies and
Citicorp Trust Bank ("CTB"), an internal transfer agent, relating to the
creation and operation of the internal transfer agent unit to serve certain
CAM-managed funds. CTB did not provide services to the Fund. This notification
arises out of a previously disclosed investigation by the SEC and the U.S.
Attorney and relates to CTB's entry in 1999 into the transfer agency business,
CAM's retention of, and agreements with an unaffiliated sub transfer agent, the
adequacy of the disclosures made to the fund boards that approved the transfer
agency arrangements, (including CAM's failure to disclose a related revenue
guarantee agreement benefiting CAM and its affiliates), and CAM's operation of
and compensation for

                                                                        Page 29

the transfer agency business. The revenue guarantee described above was
terminated in 1999 and CAM will be paying the applicable funds, primarily
through fee waivers, a total of approximately $17 million (plus interest) that
is the amount of the revenue received by Citigroup relating to the revenue
guarantee. Citigroup is cooperating fully in the investigation and will seek to
resolve the matter in discussions with the SEC Staff. Although there can be no
assurance, Citigroup does not believe that this matter will have a material
adverse effect on the Fund.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Salomon Brothers Global High Income Fund Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, of
changes in net assets and of cash flows and the financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Salomon Brothers
Global High Income Fund Inc. ("Fund") at May 31, 2004, the results of its
operations, the changes in its net assets, its cash flows, and the financial
highlights for the period July 28, 2003 (commencement of operations) through
May 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. These financial statements and financial
highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit, which included
confirmation of securities at May 31, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers, provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited)

Unless you elect to receive distributions in cash, all dividends, including any
capital gain dividends, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested
by PFPC, as agent for the Common Shareholders (the "Plan Agent"), in additional
Common Shares under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"). You may elect
not to participate in the Plan by contacting the Plan Agent. If you do not
participate, you will receive all cash distributions paid by check mailed
directly to you by PFPC as dividend paying agent.

If you participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will receive
will be determined as follows:

(1) If the market price of the Common Shares on the record date (or, if the
record date is not a New York Stock Exchange trading day, the immediately
preceding trading day) for determining shareholders eligible to receive the
relevant dividend or distribution (the "determination date") is equal to or
exceeds 98% of the net asset value per share of the Common Shares, the Fund
will issue new Common Shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) 98% of the
net asset value per share at the close of trading on the Exchange on the
determination date or (b) 95% of the market price per share of the Common
Shares on the determination date.

(2) If 98% of the net asset value per share of the Common Shares exceeds the
market price of the Common Shares on the determination date, the Plan Agent
will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will buy Common Shares in
the open market, on the Exchange or elsewhere, for your account as soon as
practicable commencing on the trading day following the determination date and
terminating no later than the earlier of (a) 30 days after the dividend or
distribution payment date, or (b) the record date for the next succeeding
dividend or distribution to be made to the Common Shareholders; except when
necessary to comply with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.
If during this period: (i) the market price rises so that it equals or exceeds
98% of the net asset value per share of the Common Shares at the close of
trading on the Exchange on the determination date before the Plan Agent has
completed the open market purchases or (ii) if the Plan Agent is unable to
invest the full amount eligible to be reinvested in open market purchases, the
Plan Agent will cease purchasing Common Shares in the open market and the Fund
shall issue the remaining Common Shares at a price per share equal to the
greater of (a) 98% of the net asset value per share at the close of trading on
the Exchange on the determination date or (b) 95% of the then current market
price per share.

The Plan Agent maintains all participants' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all
Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

You may withdraw from the Plan by notifying the Plan Agent in writing at P.O.
Box 43027, Boston, Massachusetts 02266-3027 or by calling the Plan Agent at
1-800-331-1710. Such withdrawal will be effective immediately if notice is
received by the Plan Agent not less than ten

                                                                        Page 37

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (unaudited) (continued)

business days prior to any dividend or distribution record date; otherwise such
withdrawal will be effective as soon as practicable after the Plan Agent's
investment of the most recently declared dividend or distribution on the Common
Shares. The Plan may be terminated by the Fund upon notice in writing mailed to
Common Shareholders at least 30 days prior to the record date for the payment
of any dividend or distribution by the Fund for which the termination is to be
effective. Upon any termination, you will be sent a certificate or certificates
for the full Common Shares held for you under the Plan and cash for any
fractional Common Shares. You may elect to notify the Plan Agent in advance of
such termination to have the Plan Agent sell part or all of your shares on your
behalf. You will be charged $5.00 plus a $0.05 per Common Share service charge
and the Plan Agent is authorized to deduct brokerage charges actually incurred
for this transaction from the proceeds.

There is no service charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases. Because all dividends and distributions will be automatically
reinvested in additional Common Shares, this allows you to add to your
investment through dollar cost averaging, which may lower the average cost of
your Common Shares over time.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if, in the judgment
of the Board of Directors, the change is warranted. There is no direct service
charge to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to
amend the Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants.
Additional information about the Plan and your account may be obtained from the
Plan Agent at 1-800-331-1710.

                        procedures described in paragraph (c) (7) of Rule 2-01
                        of Regulation S-X.

                        The Charter for the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of
                        the Board of each registered investment company (the
                        "Fund") advised by Smith Barney Fund Management LLC or
                        Salomon Brothers Asset Management Inc or one of their
                        affiliates (each, an "Adviser") requires that the
                        Committee shall approve (a) all audit and permissible
                        non-audit services to be provided to the Fund and (b)
                        all permissible non-audit services to be provided by the
                        Fund's independent auditors to the Adviser and any
                        Covered Service Providers if the engagement relates
                        directly to the operations and financial reporting of
                        the Fund. The Committee may implement policies and
                        procedures by which such services are approved other
                        than by the full Committee.

                        The Committee shall not approve non-audit services that
                        the Committee believes may impair the independence of
                        the auditors. As of the date of the approval of this

                        revenues paid to the independent auditors during the
                        fiscal year in which the permissible non-audit services

                        any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
                        control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services
                        to the Fund during the fiscal year in which the services
                        are provided that would have to be approved by the

                        not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement
                        to be non-audit services; and (iii) such services are
                        promptly brought to the attention of the Committee and
                        approved by the Committee (or its delegate(s)) prior to

                (h)     Yes. The Salomon Brothers Global High Income Fund Inc.'s
                        Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of
                        non-audit services that were rendered to Service
                        Affiliates which were not pre-approved (not requiring
                        pre-approval) is compatible with maintaining the
                        Auditor's independence. All services provided by the
                        Accountant to the Salomon Brothers Global High Income
                        Fund Inc. or to Service Affiliates which were required
                        to be pre-approved were pre-approved as required.


ITEM 5.         AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

                Not applicable.

ITEM 6.         [RESERVED]

ITEM 7.         DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
                CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                The Board of Directors of the Fund has delegated the authority
                to develop policies and procedures relating to proxy voting to
                the Manager. The Manager is part of Citigroup Asset Management
                ("CAM"), a group of investment adviser affiliates of Citigroup,
                Inc. ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment advisers
                that comprise CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of proxy voting
                policies and procedures (the "Policies") to ensure that the
                Manager votes proxies relating to equity securities in the best
                interest of clients.

                In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
                principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best

<PAGE>

                interest of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all
                factors that could affect the value of the investment and will
                vote proxies in the manner that it believes will be consistent
                with efforts to maximize shareholder values. The Manager may
                utilize an external service provider to provide it with
                information and/or a recommendation with regard to proxy votes.
                However, such recommendations do not relieve the Manager of its
                responsibility for the proxy vote.

                In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated
                position in the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with
                such stated position. In the case of a proxy issue for which
                there is a list of factors set forth in the Policies that CAM
                considers in voting on such issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case
                basis in accordance with the general principles set forth above
                and considering such enumerated factors. In the case of a proxy
                issue for which there is no stated position or list of factors
                that CAM considers in voting on such issue, CAM votes on a
                case-by-case basis in accordance with the general principles set
                forth above. Issues for which there is a stated position set
                forth in the Policies or for which there is a list of factors
                set forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such
                issues fall into a variety of categories, including election of
                directors, ratification of auditors, proxy and tender offer
                defenses, capital structure issues, executive and director
                compensation, mergers and corporate restructurings, and social
                and environmental issues. The stated position on an issue set
                forth in the Policies can always be superseded, subject to the
                duty to act solely in the best interest of the beneficial owners
                of accounts, by the investment management professionals
                responsible for the account whose shares are being voted. Issues
                applicable to a particular industry may cause CAM to abandon a
                policy that would have otherwise applied to issuers generally.
                As a result of the independent investment advisory services
                provided by distinct CAM business units, there may be occasions
                when different business units or different portfolio managers
                within the same business unit vote differently on the same
                issue.

                In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
                interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to
                identify and address material conflicts that may arise between
                the Manager's interests and those of its clients before voting
                proxies on behalf of such clients. To seek to identify conflicts
                of interest, CAM periodically notifies CAM employees (including
                employees of the Manager) in writing that they are under an
                obligation (i) to be aware of the potential for conflicts of
                interest with respect to voting proxies on behalf of client
                accounts both as a result of their personal relationships and
                due to special circumstances that may arise during the conduct
                of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to bring conflicts
                of interest of which they become aware to the attention of
                compliance personnel. The Manager also maintains and considers a
                list of significant relationships that could present a conflict
                of interest for the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is
                also sensitive to the fact that a significant, publicized
                relationship between an issuer and a non-CAM affiliate might
                appear to the public to influence the manner in which the
                Manager decides to vote a proxy with respect to such issuer.
                Absent special circumstances or a significant,

<PAGE>

                publicized non-CAM affiliate relationship that CAM or the
                Manager for prudential reasons treats as a potential conflict of
                interest because such relationship might appear to the public to
                influence the manner in which the Manager decides to vote a
                proxy, the Manager generally takes the position that non-CAM
                relationships between Citigroup and an issuer (e.g. investment
                banking or banking) do not present a conflict of interest for
                the Manager in voting proxies with respect to such issuer. Such
                position is based on the fact that the Manager is operated as an
                independent business unit from other Citigroup business units as
                well as on the existence of information barriers between the
                Manager and certain other Citigroup business units.

                CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager
                personnel are members, to review and address conflicts of
                interest brought to its attention by compliance personnel. A
                proxy issue that will be voted in accordance with a stated
                position on an issue or in accordance with the recommendation of
                an independent third party is not brought to the attention of
                the Proxy Voting Committee for a conflict of interest review
                because the Manager's position is that to the extent a conflict
                of interest issue exists, it is resolved by voting in accordance
                with a pre-determined policy or in accordance with the
                recommendation of an independent third party. With respect to a
                conflict of interest brought to its attention, the Proxy Voting
                Committee first determines whether such conflict of interest is
                material. A conflict of interest is considered material to the
                extent that it is determined that such conflict is likely to
                influence, or appear to influence, the Manager's decision-making
                in voting proxies. If it is determined by the Proxy Voting
                Committee that a conflict of interest is not material, the
                Manager may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the
                conflict.

                If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a
                conflict of interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is
                responsible for determining an appropriate method to resolve
                such conflict of interest before the proxy affected by the
                conflict of interest is voted. Such determination is based on
                the particular facts and circumstances, including the importance
                of the proxy issue and the nature of the conflict of interest.
                Methods of resolving a material conflict of interest may
                include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict to
                clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting
                to clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on
                their behalf.

                        SARBANES-OXLEY ACT CODE OF ETHICS
                           FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
      SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS OF CAM/U.S. REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANIES

I.      COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

        This code of ethics (the "Code") for Citigroup Asset Management's
("CAM's") U. S. registered proprietary investment companies (collectively,
"Funds" and each a, "Company") applies to each Company's Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller
(the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

    .   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
        apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
        relationships;

    .   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
        and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities
        and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made
        by the Company;

    .   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

    .   the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
        appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

    .   accountability for adherence to the Code.

    Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.     ADMINISTRATION OF CODE

        The Regional Director of CAM Compliance, North America ("Compliance
Officer") is responsible for administration of this Code, including granting
pre-approvals (see Section III below) and waivers (as described in Section VI
below), applying this Code in specific situations in which questions are
presented under it and interpreting this Code in any particular situation.

<PAGE>

III.    COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD ETHICALLY HANDLE ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS
        OF INTEREST

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the
Company. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
his position with the Company.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Company and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Company because
of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The compliance programs
and procedures of the Company and its investment adviser are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code (see Section VII
below).

        Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between a Company and the investment adviser of which the Covered Officers are
also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for a
Company or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies
and implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and a
Company. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the Company and the adviser and
is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of a Company. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Funds' Boards of Directors\Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may
also be officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered
by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the Company.

                   *             *             *            *

        Each Covered Officer must:

    .   not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
        influence investment decisions or financial reporting ( e.g. through
        fraudulent accounting

<PAGE>

        practices) by the Company whereby the Covered Officer/1/ would benefit
        personally to the detriment of the Company; or

    .   not cause the Company to take action, or fail to take action, for the
        individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than for the
        benefit of the Company; and

    .   not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
        contemplated for the Company to trade personally or cause others to
        trade personally in contemplation of the market affect of such
        transactions.

    .   There are some potential conflict of interest situations that should
        always be discussed with the Compliance Officer, if material. Examples
        are as follows:

                (1) service as a director on the board of any public or private
        company;

                (2) any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
        relationship with, any of the Company's service providers, other than
        its investment adviser,

                (3) a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
        transaction charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting
        portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
        interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as
        compensation or equity ownership; and

                (4) the receipt of any gifts or the conveyance of any value
        (including entertainment ) from any company with which the Company has
        current or prospective business dealings, except:

                        (a) any non-cash gifts of nominal value (nominal value
                is less than $100); and

                        (b) customary and reasonable meals and entertainment at
                which the giver is present, such as the occasional business meal
                or sporting event.

IV.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

Each Covered Officer:

    .   should be familiar with his or her responsibilities in connection with
        the disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Company;

- ----------
/1/     Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
        Officer would also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a
        member of a Covered Officer's family (spouse, minor children and any
        account over which a Covered Officer is deemed to have beneficial
        interest) engages in such an activity or has such a relationship.

<PAGE>

    .   should not knowingly misrepresent, or knowingly cause others to
        misrepresent, facts about the Company to others, whether within or
        outside the Company, including to the Company's directors and auditors,
        and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

    .   should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
        responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Funds
        and the investment adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair,
        accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
        documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public
        communications made by the Funds; and

    .   is responsible to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions
        imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

        Each Covered Officer must:

    .   upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
        Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that the Covered
        Officer has received, read, and understands the Code;

    .   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied with
        the requirements of the Code;

    .   annually disclose affiliations and other relationships related to
        conflicts of interest;

    .   not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
        Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
        that are made in good faith; and

    .   notify the Compliance Officer promptly if he knows of any violation of
        this Code (failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code).

        In rendering decisions and interpretations and in conducting
investigations of potential violations under the Code, the Compliance Officer
may, at his discretion, consult with such persons as he determines to be
appropriate, including, but not limited to, a senior legal officer of the
Company or its investment adviser or its affiliates, independent auditors or
other consultants, subject to any requirement to seek pre-approval from the
Company's audit committee for the retention of independent auditors to perform
permissible non-audit services. The Funds will follow these procedures in
investigating and enforcing the Code:

    .   the Compliance Officer will take all appropriate action to investigate
        any potential violation of which he becomes aware;

    .   if, after investigation the Compliance Officer believes that no
        violation has occurred, the Compliance Officer is not required to take
        any further action;

<PAGE>

    .   any matter that the Compliance Officer believes is a violation will be
        reported to the Directors of the Fund who are not "interested persons"
        as defined in the Investment Company Act the ("Non-interested
        Directors")

    .   if the Non-interested Directors of the Board concur that a violation has
        occurred, it will consider appropriate action, which may include review
        of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and
        procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
        adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered
        Officer; and

    .   any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, be
        disclosed as provided by SEC rules

     The Compliance Officer shall submit an annual report to the Board
describing any waivers granted.

VI.     WAIVERS/2/

        A Covered Officer may request a waiver of any of the provisions of the
Code by submitting a written request for such waiver to the Compliance Officer,
setting forth the basis of such request and explaining how the waiver would be
consistent with the standards of conduct described herein. The Compliance
Officer shall review such request and make a determination thereon in writing,
which shall be binding.

        In determining whether to waive any provisions of this Code, the
Compliance Officer shall consider whether the proposed waiver is consistent with
honest and ethical conduct and other purposes of this Code.

VII.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code. The codes of ethics of the funds and the
investment advisers and principal underwriters under Rule 17j-1 of the
Investment Company Act and the Citigroup Code of Conduct and Citigroup Statement
of Business Practices as well as other policies of the Fund's investment
advisers or their affiliates are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

- ----------
/2/     For purposes of this Code, Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the
        approval by a Company of a material departure from a provision of the
        Code" and includes an "implicit waiver," which means a Company's failure
        to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material
        departure from a provision of the Code that has been made known to an
        executive officer of the Company.

<PAGE>

VIII.   AMENDMENTS

        Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B and
C must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a
majority of Non-interested Directors.

IX.     CONFIDENTIALITY

        All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board and Company
and their respective counsel, counsel to the non-Interested Directors or
independent auditors or other consultants referred to in Section V above.

X.      INTERNAL USE

        The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Company, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
