We submit herewith the financial statements of the Petroleum & Resources
Corporation (the Corporation) for the six months ended June 30, 2007. In
addition, there are the report of the independent registered public accounting
firm, a schedule of investments, and other financial information.

Net assets of the Corporation at June 30, 2007 were $42.86 per share on
21,877,275 shares outstanding, compared with $36.61 per share at December 31,
2006 on 22,180,867 shares outstanding. On March 1, 2007, a distribution of
$0.13 per share was paid, consisting of $0.07 from 2006 long-term capital gain,
$0.03 from 2006 short-term capital gain and $0.03 from 2006 investment income,
all taxable in 2007. A 2007 investment income dividend of $0.13 per share was
paid on June 1, 2007, and another $0.13 investment income dividend has been
declared to shareholders of record August 14, 2007, payable September 1, 2007.

Net investment income for the six months ended June 30, 2007 amounted to
$4,576,717, compared with $5,219,727 for the same period in 2006. These
earnings are equal to $0.21 and $0.25 per share.

Net capital gain realized on investments for the six months ended June 30, 2007
amounted to $54,762,148, or $2.50 per share.

The total return on net asset value (with dividends and capital gains
reinvested) of shares of the Corporation was 17.9% for the six months ended

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation is an internally-managed fund emphasizing petroleum and other
natural resource investments. The investment objectives of the Corporation are
preservation of capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments,
and an opportunity for capital appreciation.

Security Valuation--Investments in securities traded on national security
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options) are valued at amortized cost. Purchased and written options
are valued at the last quoted asked price.

Security Transactions and Investment Income--Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to stockholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

2.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
stockholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at June 30, 2007 was $431,005,124 and net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $545,385,581, of which the related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation were $546,928,697 and $1,543,116, respectively.

Distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, annual
reclassifications are made within the Corporation's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution under income tax regulations. Any
income tax-related interest or penalties would be classified as income tax
expense.

Effective June 29, 2007, the Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes, a clarification of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes. FIN 48 establishes financial reporting rules regarding recognition and
measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. The
adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the Corporation's net assets or results of
operations.

3.  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Corporation's investment decisions are made by a committee of management,
and recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the six months ended June 30, 2007 were $9,607,073 and
$75,086,311, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. The Corporation, as writer of an option, bears the risks of
possible illiquidity of the option markets and from movements in security
values. The risk associated with purchasing an option is limited to the premium
originally paid. A schedule of outstanding option contracts as of June 30, 2007
can be found on page 12.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
six months ended June 30, 2007 were as follows:

5.  RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan
covers all employees with at least one year of service. In addition, the
Corporation has a non-contributory nonqualified defined benefit plan which
provides eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the
qualified plan. Benefits are based on length of service and compensation during
the last five years of employment.

The funded status of the plans is recognized as an asset (overfunded plan) or a
liability (underfunded plan) in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Changes in the prior service costs and accumulated actuarial gains and losses
are recognized as accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of net
assets, in the year in which the changes occur.

The Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to
meet benefits to be paid to plan participants. During the six months ended June
30, 2007, the Corporation contributed $15,604 to the plans and expects to
contribute an additional $315,604 to the plans during the remainder of 2007.

The following table aggregates the components of the plans' net periodic
pension cost.

</TABLE>

The Corporation also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all employees. For the six months ended June 30, 2007, the
Corporation expensed contributions of $52,684. The Corporation does not provide
postretirement medical benefits.

6.  EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

Although the Stock Option Plan of 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, unexercised grants of stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2004 and prior years remain
outstanding. The exercise price of the unexercised options and related stock
appreciation rights is the fair market value on date of grant, reduced by the
per share amount of capital gains paid by the Corporation during subsequent
years. All options and related stock appreciation rights terminate 10 years
from date of grant, if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of June 30, 2007, and
changes during the six month period then ended is presented below:

the intrinsic value of the award, recognized over the award's vesting period,
and remeasured at each reporting date through the date of settlement. The total
compensation cost recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2007 was
$394,627.

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 872,639 shares of the
Corporation's Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based
restricted stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of
a specified three year period, with the ultimate number of awards earned
contingent on achievement of certain performance targets. If performance
targets are not achieved, all or a portion of the performance-based awards are
forfeited and become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based
restricted stock awards vest ratably over a three year period and
nonperformance-based restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors)
vest over a one year period. It is the current intention that employee grants
will be performance-based. The 2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in
the event of death or retirement. Non-employee directors also may elect to
defer a portion of their cash compensation, with such deferred amount to be
paid by delivery of deferred stock units. Outstanding awards are granted at
fair market value on grant date. The number of shares of Common Stock which
remain available for future grants under the 2005 Plan at June 30, 2007 is
831,063 shares.

The Corporation pays dividends and dividend equivalents on outstanding awards,
which are charged to net assets when paid. Dividends and dividend equivalents
paid on restricted awards that are later forfeited are reclassified to
compensation expense.

A summary of the status of the Corporations's awards granted under the 2005
Plan as of June 30, 2007, and changes during the six month period then ended is
presented below:

Compensation costs resulting from awards granted under the 2005 Plan are based
on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized
compensation cost is reversed. The total compensation costs for restricted
stock granted to employees for the period ended June 30, 2007 were $136,750.
The total compensation costs for restricted stock units granted to non-employee
directors for the period ended June 30, 2007 were $60,059. As of June 30, 2007,
there were total unrecognized compensation costs of $617,653, a component of
additional capital surplus, related to nonvested equity-based compensation
arrangements granted under the 2005 Plan. Those costs are expected to be
recognized over a weighted average period of 1.83 years.

7.  OFFICER AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

The aggregate remuneration paid during the six months ended June 30, 2007 to
officers and directors amounted to $1,615,711, of which $190,991 was paid as
fees and compensation to directors who were not officers. These amounts
represent the taxable income to the Corporation's officers and directors and
therefore differ from the amounts reported in the accompanying Statement of
Operations that are recorded and expensed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

8.  PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to brokers, secured by cash deposits,
U.S. Government securities, or bank letters of credit. The Corporation accounts
for securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives
compensation in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the
investment of any cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues
to receive interest or dividends on the securities loaned. The loans are
secured at all times by collateral of at least 102% of the fair value of the
securities loaned plus accrued interest. Gain or loss in the fair value of
securities loaned that may occur during the term of the loan will be for the
account of the Corporation. At June 30, 2007, the Corporation had securities on
loan of $39,970,359 and held collateral of $40,462,282, consisting of an
investment trust fund which may invest in money market instruments, commercial
paper, repurchase agreements, U.S. Treasury Bills, and U.S. agency obligations.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF PETROLEUM & RESOURCES CORPORATION:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(the Corporation) at June 30, 2007, the results of its operations, the changes
in its net assets and the financial highlights for each of the fiscal periods
presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Corporation's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at June 30, 2007 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

                          AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In June 2007, the Board of Directors of the Corporation adopted Amended and
Restated Bylaws for the Corporation. Among other changes, the Amended and
Restated Bylaws:

  .   add procedures and informational requirements governing the calling of a
      stockholder-requested special meeting of stockholders;

  .   add informational requirements and modify the timing for the advance
      notice of stockholder nominees for the Board of Directors and of other
      stockholder proposals--stockholders are now generally required to notify
      the Corporation in writing of any proposal which they intend to present
      at an annual meeting of stockholders, including any nominations for
      director, between 120 and 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the
      mailing date of the notice for the prior year's annual meeting of
      stockholders.

  .   implement changes to conform to the charter of the Corporation as
      recently amended and restated by the stockholders, and

  .   include updates to conform to changes in Maryland law and current
      corporate governance practice.

As a result of the changes to the advance notice bylaws summarized above, the
advance notice of Director nominees and any other proposals that a stockholder
seeks to bring before the 2008 Annual Meeting but does not seek to have
included in the Corporation's proxy statement and form of proxy for that
meeting must be received at the office of the Corporation no earlier than
September 19, 2007, and no later than October 19, 2007. Please note that these
dates are different from those that were provided in the Corporation's proxy
statement for the 2007 Annual Meeting, which dates are no longer correct.

Item 10. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

In  June  2007,  Registrant's  Board  of  Directors  adopted
Amended and Restated Bylaws for the Corporation that,  among
other  changes, make material changes to the  procedures  by
which  stockholders may recommend nominees  to  Registrant's
Board   of   Directors.   In  general,   the   changes   add
informational  requirements and modify the  timing  for  the
advance  notice  of stockholder nominees for  the  Board  of
Directors and of other stockholder proposals -- stockholders
are  now  generally  required to notify the  Corporation  in
writing of any proposal which they intend to present  at  an
annual  meeting  of stockholders, including any  nominations
for  director, between 120 and 150 days prior to  the  first
anniversary of the mailing date of the notice for the  prior
year's annual meeting of stockholders.

The Amended and Restated Bylaws governing the advance notice
requirements for stockholders who wish to recommend Director
nominees provide as follows:
Section  2.9.   Advance Notice of Stockholder  Nominees  for
Director and Other Stockholder Proposals.

     (a)  Annual Meetings of Stockholders.

           (1)   Nominations of individuals for election  to
the Board of Directors and the proposal of other business to
be  considered by the stockholders may be made at an  annual
meeting  of  stockholders (i) pursuant to the  Corporation's
notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the  Board
of  Directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation
who  was a stockholder of record both at the time of  giving
of notice by the stockholder as provided for in this Section
2.9(a)  and  at  the  time  of the annual  meeting,  who  is
entitled  to  vote at the meeting and who has complied  with
this Section 2.9(a).

           (2)   For  nominations or other  business  to  be
properly  brought before an annual meeting by a  stockholder
pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph (a)(1) of this Section
2.9,  the stockholder must have given timely notice  thereof
in  writing  to  the Secretary of the Corporation  and  such
other  business must otherwise be a proper matter for action
by  the  stockholders.  To be timely, a stockholder's notice
shall  set forth all information required under this Section
2.9 and shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive  office  of the Corporation not earlier  than  the
150th  day  prior to the first anniversary of  the  Date  of
Mailing  of the Notice (as defined herein) for the preceding
year's  annual  meeting nor later than  5:00  p.m.,  Eastern
Time, on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the
Date  of  Mailing  of  the Notice for the  preceding  year's
annual  meeting; provided, however, that in the  event  that
the  date  of the annual meeting is advanced or  delayed  by
more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the date  of
the   preceding  year's  annual  meeting,  notice   by   the
stockholder  to be timely must be so delivered  not  earlier
than  the 150th day prior to the date of such annual meeting
and not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the later  of
the  120th  day prior to the date of such annual meeting  or
the tenth day following the day on which public announcement
of  the  date  of  such meeting is first made.   The  public
announcement of a postponement or adjournment of  an  annual
meeting shall not commence a new time period for the  giving
of   a   stockholder's  notice  as  described  above.   Such
stockholder's  notice  shall  set  forth  (i)  as  to   each
individual  whom  the stockholder proposes to  nominate  for
election  or  reelection as a director, (A) the  name,  age,
business  address and residence address of such  individual,
(B)  the class, series and number of any shares of stock  of
the   Corporation  that  are  beneficially  owned  by   such
individual, (C) the date such shares were acquired  and  the
investment  intent  of such acquisition,  (D)  whether  such
stockholder believes any such individual is, or is  not,  an
"interested  person" of the Corporation, as defined  in  the
Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended, and  the  rules
promulgated  thereunder (the "Investment Company  Act")  and
information regarding such individual that is sufficient, in
the  discretion of the Board of Directors or  any  committee
thereof  or  any  authorized officer of the Corporation,  to
make  such  determination  and  (E)  all  other  information
relating to such individual that is required to be disclosed
in  solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an
election  contest  (even  if  an  election  contest  is  not
involved),  or is otherwise required, in each case  pursuant
to  Regulation  14A (or any successor provision)  under  the
Exchange  Act  and  the  rules  thereunder  (including  such
individual's  written consent to being named  in  the  proxy
statement  as  a  nominee and to serving as  a  director  if
elected); (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder
proposes to bring before the meeting, a description of  such
business,  the  reasons for proposing such business  at  the
meeting  and any material interest in such business of  such
stockholder  and  any  Stockholder  Associated  Person   (as
defined  below), individually or in the aggregate, including
any   anticipated  benefit  to  the  stockholder   and   the
Stockholder  Associated Person therefrom; (iii)  as  to  the
stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated
Person,  (A) the class, series and number of all  shares  of
stock of the Corporation which are owned by such stockholder
and  by such Stockholder Associated Person, if any, (B)  the
nominee holder for, and number of, shares owned beneficially
but  not  of  record by such stockholder  and  by  any  such
Stockholder Associated Person, (C) whether and the extent to
which  any  hedging  or  other  transaction  or  series   of
transactions  has been entered into by or on behalf  of,  or
any other agreement, arrangement or understanding (including
any  short  position or any borrowing or lending of  shares)
has  been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate
loss  to  or manage risk of share price changes for,  or  to
increase  the voting power of, such stockholder or any  such
Stockholder Associated Person with respect to any  share  of
stock    of    the   Corporation   (collectively,   "Hedging
Activities")  and (D) a general description of  whether  and
the  extent  to  which such stockholder or such  Stockholder
Associated  Person  has engaged in Hedging  Activities  with
respect   to   shares  of  stock  of  any  other  closed-end
investment  company; (iv) as to the stockholder  giving  the
notice  and  any  Stockholder Associated Person  covered  by
clauses  (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph (2) of this Section
2.9(a),  the name and address of such stockholder,  as  they
appear  on  the Corporation's stock ledger and current  name
and   address,   if  different,  and  of  such   Stockholder
Associated  Person;  and  (v) to the  extent  known  by  the
stockholder giving the notice, the name and address  of  any
other  stockholder supporting the nominee  for  election  or
reelection  as a director or the proposal of other  business
on the date of such stockholder's notice.

           (3)   Notwithstanding anything in this subsection
(a)  of this Section 2.9 to the contrary, in the event  that
the  number  of  directors to be elected  to  the  Board  of
Directors  is  increased and there is no public announcement
of  such  action  at  least  130 days  prior  to  the  first
anniversary  of  the date of mailing of the  notice  of  the
preceding  year's  annual meeting,  a  stockholder's  notice
required  by  this Section 2.9(a) shall also  be  considered
timely,  but  only  with respect to  nominees  for  any  new
positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered
to  the  Secretary at the principal executive office of  the
Corporation not later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time,  on  the
tenth   day   following  the  day  on  which   such   public
announcement is first made by the Corporation.

            (4)    For   purposes  of  this   Section   2.9,
"Stockholder  Associated Person" of  any  stockholder  shall
mean (i) any person controlling, directly or indirectly,  or
acting in concert with, such stockholder (including, without
limitation,  any  person who is a member of  a  "group"  for
purposes  of  Section  13(d) of the  Exchange  Act,  or  any
successor  provision, that includes such stockholder),  (ii)
any  beneficial owner of shares of stock of the  Corporation
owned  of  record  or beneficially by such  stockholder  and
(iii)  any person controlling, controlled by or under common
control with such Stockholder Associated Person.

      (b)  Special  Meetings  of  Stockholders.   Only  such
business  shall  be  conducted  at  a  special  meeting   of
stockholders as shall have been brought before  the  meeting
pursuant   to   the   Corporation's   notice   of   meeting.
Nominations  of  individuals for election to  the  Board  of
Directors  may be made at a special meeting of  stockholders
at  which  directors are to be elected (i) pursuant  to  the
Corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction
of  the Board of Directors or (iii) provided that the  Board
of  Directors has determined that directors shall be elected
at   such  special  meeting,  by  any  stockholder  of   the
Corporation who is a stockholder of record both at the  time
of  giving of notice provided for in this Section 2.9 and at
the time of the special meeting, who is entitled to vote  at
the  meeting and who complied with the notice procedures set
forth  in  this  Section 2.9.  In the event the  Corporation
calls  a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose  of
electing  one or more individuals to the Board of Directors,
any   such   stockholder  may  nominate  an  individual   or
individuals (as the case may be) for election as a  director
as  specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the
stockholder's  notice  required by  paragraph  (2)  of  this
Section  2.9(a) shall be delivered to the Secretary  at  the
principal  executive office of the Corporation  not  earlier
than  the  150th day prior to such special meeting  and  not
later  than  5:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on the  later  of  the
120th  day  prior to such special meeting or the  tenth  day
following the day on which public announcement is first made
of  the  date  of  the special meeting and of  the  nominees
proposed  by  the Board of Directors to be elected  at  such
meeting.   The  public  announcement of  a  postponement  or
adjournment  of a special meeting shall not commence  a  new
time  period  for  the giving of a stockholder's  notice  as
described above.

     (c)  General.

           (1)  Upon written request by the Secretary or the
Board of Directors or any committee thereof, any stockholder
proposing  a  nominee  for election as  a  director  or  any
proposal  for  other business at a meeting  of  stockholders
shall provide, within five Business Days of delivery of such
request  (or such other period as may be specified  in  such
request),   written  verification,  satisfactory,   in   the
discretion  of  the  Board  of Directors  or  any  committee
thereof  or  any  authorized officer of the Corporation,  to
demonstrate the accuracy of any information submitted by the
stockholder  pursuant to this Section 2.9.  If a stockholder
fails  to  provide  such  written verification  within  such
period, the information as to which written verification was
requested  may  be  deemed  not to  have  been  provided  in
accordance with this Section 2.9.

           (2)   Only such individuals who are nominated  in
accordance  with  this  Section 2.9 shall  be  eligible  for
election  by  stockholders  as  directors,  and  only   such
business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders  as
shall  have  been brought before the meeting  in  accordance
with  this  Section 2.9.  The chairman of the meeting  shall
have  the  power  to determine whether a nomination  or  any
other business proposed to be brought before the meeting was
made  or  proposed, as the case may be, in  accordance  with
this Section 2.9.

           (3)   For purposes of this Section 2.9,  (a)  the
"Date  of Mailing of the Notice" shall mean the date of  the
proxy statement for the solicitation of proxies for election
of  directors  and  (b)  "public  announcement"  shall  mean
disclosure (i) in a press release reported by the Dow  Jones
News  Service, Associated Press, Business Wire, PR  Newswire

Commission  pursuant to the Exchange Act or  the  Investment
Company Act.

           (4)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions  of

Item 11. Controls and Procedures.

Conclusions  of principal officers concerning  controls  and
procedures.

  (a)   As  of July  23, 2007, an evaluation  was  performed
under  the  supervision and with the  participation  of  the
officers  of  registrant, including the principal  executive
officer (PEO) and principal financial officer (PFO), of  the
effectiveness   of  registrant's  disclosure   controls  and
procedures.   Based  on  that  evaluation,  the registrant's
officers, including the PEO and PFO, concluded that,  as  of
July  23,  2007, the  registrant's  disclosure  controls and
procedures  were reasonably designed so as  to  ensure  that
material  information  relating to the  registrant  is  made
known to the PEO and PFO.

   (b)    There  have  been no significant  changes  in  the
registrant's  internal control over financial  reporting (as
defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940   (17   CFR  270.30a-3(d))  that  occurred  during  the
registrant's  last  fiscal  half-year  that  has  materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,  the
registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12. Exhibits attached hereto. (Attach certifications as
exhibits)

(1)  Not  applicable. See registrant's response to  Item  2,
above.

(2)  Separate  certifications by the registrant's  principal
executive officer and principal financial officer,  pursuant
to  Section  302  of  the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of  2002  and
required by Rule 30a-2 under the Investment Company  Act  of
1940, are attached.



A  certification  by  the registrant's  principal  executive
officer and principal financial officer, pursuant to Section
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, is attached.


Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange  Act
of  1934  and  the  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940,  the
registrant has duly caused this report to be signed  on  its
behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
