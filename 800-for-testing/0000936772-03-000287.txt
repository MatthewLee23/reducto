Semi-Annual Report
This report provides management's discussion of fund performance for Alliance
National Municipal Income Fund's (the "Fund") semi-annual reporting period ended
April 30, 2003.

Investment Objective and Policies
The Fund is a closed-end management investment company designed for investors
who seek high current income exempt from regular federal income tax. The Fund
normally invests at least 75% of its assets in investment grade municipal
securities.

Investment Results
The following table provides performance data for the Fund and its benchmark,
the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, for the six- and 12-month periods
ended April 30, 2003. For comparison, returns for the Lipper General & Leveraged
Municipal Debt Funds Average are also included.

  *The Fund's investment results are for the periods shown and are based on the
   Fund's net asset value (NAV) as of April 30, 2003. All fees and expenses
   related to the operation of the Fund have been deducted. Returns for the Fund
   include the reinvestment of any distributions paid during the period. Past
   performance is no guarantee of future results.

   The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is a total return performance
   benchmark for the long-term, investment grade tax-exempt bond market. The
   Lipper General & Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds Average is comprised of
   leveraged closed-end funds with generally similar investment objectives to
   Alliance National Municipal Income Fund. An investor cannot invest directly
   in an index, and its results are not indicative of any specific investment,
   including Alliance National Municipal Income Fund.

Investment Results
For the past six months ended April 30, 2003, the municipal bond market posted
positive returns. The Fund generated a positive return as well, outperforming
its benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, as well as the Lipper
General & Leverage Municipal Debt Funds Average. The Fund's outperformance in
comparison to its Lipper peer group can be attributed to its relatively high
average credit quality.

Over the past 12 months, municipal bond yields declined substantially. This
resulted in strong positive price performance for the municipal bond market. The
Fund also generated a positive rate of return over this period. For the 12
months, the Fund outperformed both

<PAGE>


the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index and the Lipper General & Leveraged
Municipal Debt Funds Average. Once again, the Fund's relatively strong
performance is attributable to the Fund's higher average credit quality. In
addition, the Fund's performance was aided by the advance refunding of a 2.5%
position, Alabama's Jefferson County Sewer Revenue. An advance refunding results
in the bond becoming secured by U.S. government securities, and its effective
maturity date becomes the same as the first call date. These two modifications
result in a substantial increase in bond price.

Market Review and Investment Strategy
The pace of municipal issuance continues to be quite strong. Year-to-date
issuance has totaled $145.6 billion--an increase of almost 14% from the same
period in 2002. This high level of issuance has impaired municipal price
performance relative to the taxable bond market. State and local governments are
currently mired in their worst financial crises in decades. Policy makers are
debating how much to cut expenses and raise taxes to close their projected
budget shortfalls. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that
states' collective projected budget deficits could reach $85 billion in fiscal
year 2004. Two states, California and Oregon, were recently downgraded by
Moody's Investors Service, and 16 more continue to have "negative" outlooks,
meaning they are at risk for being downgraded, as well. The Fund has minimal
general obligation exposure and, therefore, has generally been sheltered from
the recent credit spread widening affecting these bonds.

Investment activity over the past six months focused on improving the credit
quality of the Fund. The Fund's exposure to the health care and tobacco
settlement sectors was reduced over the period and replaced by higher credit
quality bonds. In an effort to maintain a low cost of leverage, one series of
its variable rate preferred stock was reset into an extended rate mode expiring
in December, 2003. Two other series had been previously reset into extended rate
mode, expiring in August, 2003. The final series continues to reset on a weekly
basis.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2003 (unaudited)

NOTE A
Significant Accounting Policies
Alliance National Municipal Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), was incorporated in
the state of Maryland on November 9, 2001 and is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment
company. Prior to the commencement of operations on January 28, 2002, the Fund
had no operations other than the sale to Alliance Capital Management L.P. (the
"Adviser") of 6,667 shares in the amount of $100,005 on January 23, 2002. The
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, which require management to make
certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets
and liabilities in the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund.

1. Security Valuation
In accordance with Pricing Policies adopted by the Board of Directors of the
Fund (the "Pricing Policies") and applicable law, portfolio securities are
valued at current market value or at fair value. The Board of Directors has
delegated to the Adviser, subject to the Board's continuing oversight, certain
responsibilities with respect to the implementation of the Pricing Policies.
Pursuant to the Pricing Policies, securities for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at their current market value. In general, the
market value of these securities is determined as follows:

Securities listed on a national securities exchange or on a foreign securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price at the close of the exchange or
foreign securities exchange. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the closing bid and asked prices on such
day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day, then the security is
valued in good faith at fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies.
Securities listed on more than one exchange are valued by reference to the
principal exchange on which the securities are traded; securities not listed on
an exchange but traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("NASDAQ") are valued in
accordance with the NASDAQ Official Closing Price; listed put or call options
are valued at the last sale price. If there has been no sale on that day, such
securities will be valued at the closing bid prices on that day; open futures
contracts and options thereon are valued using the closing settlement price or,
in the absence of such a price, the most recent quoted bid price. If there are
no quotations available for the day of valuations, the last available closing
settlement price is used; securities traded in the over-the-counter market, (but
excluding securities traded on NASDAQ) are valued at the mean of the current bid
and asked prices as reported by the National Quotation Bureau or other
comparable sources; U.S. Government securities and other debt instruments having
60 days or less remaining until maturity are valued at amor-


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    ALLIANCE NATIONAL MUNICIPAL INCOME FUND o 15


<PAGE>


tized cost if their original maturity was 60 days or less, or by amortizing
their fair value as of the 61st day prior to maturity if their original term to
maturity exceeded 60 days; fixed-income securities, including mortgage backed
and asset backed securities, may be valued on the basis of prices provided by a
pricing service or at a price obtained from one or more of the major
broker/dealers. In cases where broker/dealer quotes are obtained, the Pricing
Policies provide that the Adviser may establish procedures whereby changes in
market yields or spreads are used to adjust, on a daily basis, a recently
obtained quoted price on a security; and OTC and other derivatives are valued on
the basis of a quoted bid price or spread from a major broker/dealer in such
security. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are
valued at fair value in accordance with the Pricing Policies.

2. Taxes
It is the Fund's policy to meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its
investment company taxable income and net realized gains, if any, to
shareholders. Therefore, no provisions for federal income or excise taxes are
required.

3. Investment Income and Investment Transactions
Interest income is accrued daily. Investment transactions are accounted for on
the date the securities are purchased or sold. Investment gains and losses are
determined on the identified cost basis. The Fund amortizes premiums and
accretes original issue discounts and market discounts as adjustments to
interest income.

4. Dividends and Distributions
Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend
date. Income and capital gains distributions are determined in accordance with
federal tax regulations and may differ from those determined in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. To the extent
these differences are permanent, such amounts are reclassified within the
capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary
differences do not require such reclassification.

NOTE B
Advisory Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
Under the terms of an investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Adviser
an advisory fee at an annual rate of .65 of 1% of the Fund's average daily net
assets. Such fee is accrued daily and paid monthly. The Adviser has agreed to
waive a portion of its fees or reimburse the Fund for expenses in the amount of
0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets for the first 5 full years of the
Fund's operations, 0.20% of the Fund's average daily net assets in year 6, 0.15%
in year 7, 0.10% in year 8, and 0.05% in year 9. For the period ended April 30,
2003, the amount of such fees waived was $621,969.

Under the term of a Shareholder, Inquiry Agency Agreement with Alliance Global
Investor Services, Inc. (AGIS), an affiliate of the Adviser, the Fund reimburses
AGIS for costs relating to servicing phone inquiries for the Fund.During the
period ended April 30, 2003, there was no reimbursement paid to AGIS.

NOTE C
Investment Transactions
Purchases and sales of investment securities (excluding short-term investments)
for the period ended April 30, 2003, were as follows:

                                             Purchases          Sales

substantially the same as the cost for financial reporting purposes.
Accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation and unrealized depreciation are as
follows:

Gross unrealized appreciation..........................     $  23,521,128
Gross unrealized depreciation..........................        (1,842,579)
                                                            -------------
Net unrealized appreciation............................     $  21,678,549
                                                            -------------

NOTE D
Distributions To Common Shareholders
The tax character of distributions to be paid for the year ending October 30,
2003 will be determined at the end of the current fiscal year. The tax character
of distributions paid to common shareholders during the fiscal period ended
October 31, 2002 were as follows:

                                                                 2002

Undistributed tax exempt income........................     $   2,065,905
Accumulated capital and other losses...................        (1,199,398)(b)
Unrealized appreciation/(depreciation).................        13,765,340
                                                            -------------
Total accumulated earnings/(deficit)...................     $  14,631,847
                                                            -------------

(a) Total distributions paid differ from the statement of changes in net assets
    applicable to common shareholders because for tax purposes dividends are
    recognized when actually paid.
(b) On October 31, 2002, the Fund had a net capital loss carryforward of $
    1,199,398, all of which expires in the year 2010. To the extent future
    capital gains are offset by capital loss carryforward, such gains will not
    be distributed.

(a) Commencement of operations. Net asset value immediately after the closing of
    the first public offering was $14.30.
(b) Based on average shares outstanding.
(c) Net of fees waived by the Adviser.
(d) Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock on
    the opening of the first day and a sale on the closing of the last day of
    the period reported. Dividends and distributions, if any, are assumed for
    purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at prices obtained under the
    Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Generally, total investment return based
    on net asset value will be higher than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is an increase in the discount or a
    decrease in the premium of the market value to net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of such periods. Conversely, total investment return
    based on net asset value will be lower than total investment return based on
    market value in periods where there is a decrease in the discount or an
    increase in the premium of the market value to the net asset value from the
    beginning to the end of the period. Total investment return calculated for a
    period of less than one year is not annualized.
(e) Annualized.
(f) These expense and net investment income ratios do not reflect the effect of
    dividend payments to preferred shareholders.
