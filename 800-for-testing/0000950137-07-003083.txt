PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

The Lehman Brothers U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index is an
unmanaged, broad-based index that reflects the general performance of the U.S.
dollar denominated, fixed-rate, non-investment grade, taxable corporate bond
market. Issuers are capped at 2% of the index. It is not possible to invest
directly in an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE 12-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

Strong market fundamentals, including moderate economic growth, low default
rates, favorable earnings trends and relatively low Treasury yields created a
positive environment for the high yield market in 2006. The Federal Open Market
Committee (the "Fed") continued to pursue its monetary tightening policy in the
first six months of the year, raising the target federal funds rate at each of
its meetings to 5.25 percent as of the end of June. In response to Fed
tightening, Treasury yields rose--particularly on the short end of the yield
curve--causing the yield curve to flatten and at times, become inverted. In the
second half of the year, however, as economic growth slowed and inflation
concerns eased, the Fed took a widely anticipated respite from its record
two-year run of 17 consecutive rate increases, electing to keep the target rate
unchanged for the remainder of the year. The change in the Fed's stance led to
falling yields and a bond market rally.

Overall, the high yield market performed well during the reporting period.
Because interest rates remained at relatively low levels throughout the year,
investors turned to the riskier segments of the market in an attempt to capture
higher yields. The increased appetite for risk helped provide support to the
high yield market, causing yield spreads to compress to near record low levels.
In this environment, the lowest credit tiers of the high-yield market--namely
CCC rated securities--turned in the best performance.

High demand for high-yield bonds was met by an equally high supply, which was
fueled in part by an unprecedented amount of leveraged buyout and private equity
activity during the year. In fact, more than $150 billion in new high-yield
issues came to market in 2006, breaking the previous issuance record set in
2004.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On an NAV basis, the trust outperformed the Lehman Brothers U.S.
Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap Index. On a market price basis, the trust
underperformed the Lehman Brothers U.S. Corporate High Yield 2% Issuer Cap
Index.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

Throughout the year we continued to seek to maintain a balanced and
well-diversified portfolio while allowing for strategic overweights in
securities and sectors that we believed possessed the most attractive risk
profiles. Over the course of the period, we increased the portfolio's average
credit quality to be higher than that of its benchmark. The trust adopted this
conservative posture because in our view, yield spreads, which were at
historically tight levels, reflected the persistence of a near-perfect credit
environment for an unrealistically extended period of time. This defensive
positioning dampened performance as the lowest-rated segments of the market
outperformed.

In terms of issuer size, we focused on larger companies because of their
financial flexibility, their ability to withstand less favorable financial
conditions, and their superior access to capital markets. Over the course of the
year, we increased exposure to the transportation, health care, retail and
energy sectors and decreased exposure to building products, manufacturing,
chemicals, and metals. Strong security selection in several sectors, especially
autos and retail, helped boost performance, as did a lower-than-benchmark
duration (a measure of interest-rate risk), which served the portfolio well when
interest rates rose.

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividends to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage
of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. The Fed's policy of
raising interest rates throughout the period made the trust's borrowing activity

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

more expensive. However, the Trust still benefited from its use of leverage
during the year due to its ability to borrow at a fairly consistent rate and the
overall strong performance of the high yield market.

At year end, the trust's major sector overweights included autos and vehicle
parts, energy, food and tobacco, gaming/lodging, and healthcare. Key sector
underweights included technology, utilities, housing and building products, and
financials.

The Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the trust may, when appropriate,
repurchase its shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions
at a price not above market value or NAV, whichever is lower at the time of
purchase. This may help support the market value of the trust's shares.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in
the future.

CHANGES IN INVESTMENT POLICIES

The Trust approved changes in its investment policies to allow the Trust to
enter into the following transactions.

NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES

The Trust is permitted to invest up to 20% of its net assets in securities of
foreign issuers that are denominated in non-U.S. dollars. The same quality
levels currently permitted by this Trust for all investments (between BB and C
by Standard & Poor's or between Ba and C by Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or
unrated securities of comparable quality), will apply to foreign investments.

Investments in securities of foreign issuers present certain risks not
ordinarily associated with investments in securities of U.S. issuers. These
risks include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, political,
economic or legal developments (including war or other instability,
expropriation of assets, nationalization and confiscatory taxation), the
imposition of foreign exchange limitations (including currency blockage),
withholding taxes on income or capital transactions or other restrictions,
higher transaction costs (including higher brokerage, custodial and settlement
costs and currency conversion costs) and possible difficulty in enforcing
contractual obligations or taking judicial action. Securities of foreign issuers
may not be as liquid and may be more volatile than comparable securities of
domestic issuers.

In addition, there often is less publicly available information about many
foreign issuers, and issuers of foreign securities are subject to different,
often less comprehensive, auditing, accounting and financial reporting
disclosure requirements than domestic issuers. There is generally less
government regulation of exchanges, brokers and listed companies abroad than in
the United

 4
<PAGE>

States and, with respect to certain foreign countries, there is a possibility of
expropriation or confiscatory taxation, or diplomatic developments which could
affect investment in those countries. Because there is usually less supervision
and governmental regulation of foreign exchanges, brokers and dealers than there
is in the United States, the Trust may experience settlement difficulties or
delays not usually encountered in the United States.

Delays in making trades in securities of foreign issuers relating to volume
constraints, limitations or restrictions, clearance or settlement procedures, or
otherwise could impact yields and result in temporary periods when assets of the
Trust are not fully invested or attractive investment opportunities are
foregone.

The Trust may invest in securities of issuers determined by the investment
adviser to be in developing or emerging market countries. Investments in
securities of issuers in developing or emerging market countries are subject to
greater risks than investments in securities of developed countries since
emerging market countries tend to have economic structures that are less diverse
and mature and political systems that are less stable than developed countries.

In addition to the increased risks of investing in securities of foreign
issuers, there are often increased transaction costs associated with investing
in securities of foreign issuers, including the costs incurred in connection
with converting currencies, higher foreign brokerage or dealer costs and higher
settlement costs or custodial costs.

The Trust may invest in securities of foreign issuers in the form of depositary
receipts. Depositary receipts involve substantially identical risks to those
associated with direct investment in securities of foreign issuers. In addition,
the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts, particularly unsponsored
or unregistered depositary receipts, are under no obligation to distribute
shareholder communications to the holders of such receipts, or to pass through
to them any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities.

Since the Trust invests in securities denominated or quoted in currencies other
than the U.S. dollar, the Trust will be affected by changes in foreign currency
exchange rates (and exchange control regulations) which affect the value of
investments in the Trust and the accrued income and appreciation or depreciation
of the investments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the
U.S. dollar will affect the U.S. dollar value of the Trust's assets denominated
in that currency and the Trust's return on such assets as well as any temporary
uninvested reserves in bank deposits in foreign currencies. In addition, the
Trust will incur costs in connection with conversions between various
currencies.

The Trust may purchase and sell foreign currency on a spot (i.e., cash) basis in
connection with the settlement of transactions in securities traded in such
foreign currency. The Trust also may enter into contracts with banks, brokers or

                                                                               5
<PAGE>

dealers to purchase or sell securities or foreign currencies at a future date
("forward contracts"). A foreign currency forward contract is a negotiated
agreement between the contracting parties to exchange a specified amount of
currency at a specified future time at a specified rate. The rate can be higher
or lower than the spot rate between the currencies that are the subject of the
contract.

The Trust may attempt to protect against adverse changes in the value of the
U.S. dollar in relation to a foreign currency by entering into a forward
contract for the purchase or sale of the amount of foreign currency invested or
to be invested, or by buying or selling a foreign currency option or futures
contract for such amount. Such strategies may be employed before the Trust
purchases a foreign security traded in the currency which the Trust anticipates
acquiring or between the date the foreign security is purchased or sold and the
date on which payment therefor is made or received. Seeking to protect against a
change in the value of a foreign currency in the foregoing manner does not
eliminate fluctuations in the prices of portfolio securities or prevent losses
if the prices of such securities decline. Furthermore, such transactions reduce
or preclude the opportunity for gain if the value of the currency should move in
the direction opposite to the position taken. Unanticipated changes in currency
prices may result in poorer overall performance for the Trust than if it had not
entered into such contracts. The Trust may also cross-hedge currencies by
entering into a transaction to purchase or sell one or more currencies that are
expected to decline in value relative to other currencies to which it has or
expects to have exposure. The use of currency transactions can result in the
Trust incurring losses because of the imposition of exchange controls,
suspension of settlements or the inability of the Trust to deliver or receive a
specified currency. In addition, amounts paid as premiums and cash or other
assets held in margin accounts with respect to these transactions are not
otherwise available to the Trust for investment purposes.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

STRUCTURED PRODUCTS. The Trust may invest in structured notes and other types of
structured investments (referred to collectively as "structured products"). A
structured note is a derivative security for which the amount of principal
repayment and/or interest payments is based on the movement of one or more
"factors." These factors include, but are not limited to, currency exchange
rates, interest rates (such as the prime lending rate or LIBOR), referenced
bonds and stock indices. Some of these factors may or may not correlate to the
total rate of return on one or more underlying instruments referenced in such
notes. In some cases, the impact of the movements of these factors may increase
or decrease through the use of multipliers or deflators.

 6
<PAGE>

Generally, investments in structured products are interests in entities
organized and operated for the purpose of restructuring the investment
characteristics of underlying investment interests or securities. These
investment entities may be structured as trusts or other types of pooled
investment vehicles. This type of restructuring generally involves the deposit
with or purchase by an entity of the underlying investments and the issuance by
that entity of one or more classes of securities backed by, or representing
interests in, the underlying investments or referencing an indicator related to
such investments. The cash flow or rate of return on the underlying investments
may be apportioned among the newly issued securities to create different
investment characteristics, such as varying maturities, credit quality, payment
priorities and interest rate provisions. The cash flow or rate of return on a
structured product may be determined by applying a multiplier to the rate of
total return on the underlying investments or referenced indicator. Application
of a multiplier is comparable to the use of financial leverage, a speculative
technique. Leverage magnifies the potential for gain and the risk of loss. As a
result, a relatively small decline in the value of the underlying investments or
referenced indicator could result in a relatively large loss in the value of a
structured product. Holders of structured products bear risks of the underlying
index or reference obligation and are subject to counterparty risk.

The Trust may have the right to receive payments to which it is entitled only
from the structured product, and generally does not have direct rights against
the issuer. While certain structured investment vehicles enable the investor to
acquire interests in a pool of securities without the brokerage and other
expenses associated with directly holding the same securities, investors in
structured vehicles generally pay their share of the investment vehicle's
administrative and other expenses. Certain structured products may be thinly
traded or have a limited trading market and may have the effect of increasing
the Trust's illiquidity to the extent that the Trust, at a particular point in
time, may be unable to find qualified buyers for these securities.

Investments in structured notes involve risks including interest rate risk,
credit risk and market risk. Where the Trust's investments in structured notes
are based upon the movement of one or more factors, including currency exchange
rates, interest rates, referenced bonds and stock indices, depending on the
factor used and the use of multipliers or deflators, changes in interest rates
and movement of the factor may cause significant price fluctuations.
Additionally, changes in the reference instrument or security may cause the
interest rate on the structured note to be reduced to zero and any further
changes in the reference instrument may then reduce the principal amount payable
on maturity. Structured notes may be less liquid than other types of securities
and more volatile than the reference instrument or security underlying the note.

SWAPS. The Trust approved a change in its investment policies to allow the Trust
to enter into interest rate, index, total rate of return and credit default
swaps and the purchase or sale of related caps, floors and collars. The Trust

                                                                               7
<PAGE>

expects to enter into these transactions primarily to preserve a return or
spread on a particular investment or portion of its portfolio, as a duration
management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of
securities the Trust anticipates purchasing at a later date. The Trust intends
to use these transactions as hedges and not as speculative investments and will
not sell interest rate caps or floors where it does not own securities or other
instruments providing the income stream the Trust may be obligated to pay.

Interest rate swaps involve the exchange by the Trust with another party of
their respective commitments to pay or receive interest, e.g., an exchange of
floating rate payments for fixed rate payments with respect to a notional amount
of principal. The purchase of an interest rate cap entitles the purchaser, to
the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined interest rate, to
receive payments of interest on a contractually-based principal amount from the
party selling the interest rate cap. The purchase of an interest rate floor
entitles the purchaser, to the extent that a specified index falls below a
predetermined interest rate, to receive payments of interest on a
contractually-based principal amount from the party selling the interest rate
floor. An interest rate collar combines the elements of purchasing a cap and
selling a floor. The collar protects against an interest rate rise above the
maximum amount but foregoes the benefit of an interest rate decline below the
minimum amount. An index swap is an agreement to swap cash flows on a notional
amount based on changes in the values of the reference indices. For example, the
Trust may agree to swap the return generated by a fixed-income index for the
return generated by a second fixed-income index. The purchase of a cap entitles
the purchaser to receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party
selling such cap to the extent that a specified index exceeds a predetermined
interest rate or amount. The purchase of a floor entitles the purchaser to
receive payments on a notional principal amount from the party selling such
floor to the extent that a specified index falls below a predetermined interest
rate or amount. A collar is a combination of a cap and a floor that preserves a
certain return within a predetermined range of interest rates or values.

A total rate of return swap is an agreement in which one party (total return
payer) transfers the total economic performance of a reference obligation to the
other party (total return receiver). Total economic performance includes income
from interest and fees, gains or losses from market movements, and credit
losses. The total return receiver assumes the entire economic exposure--that is,
both market and credit exposure--to the reference asset. The total return
payer--often the owner of the reference obligation--gives up economic exposure
to the performance of the reference asset and in return takes on counterparty
credit exposure to the total return receiver in the event of a default or fall
in value of the reference asset.

The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts or credit-linked notes
for hedging purposes or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Trust may
otherwise invest. A credit default swap is an agreement between two parties to

 8
<PAGE>

exchange the credit risk of an issuer (reference entity). A buyer of a credit
default swap is said to buy protection by paying periodic fees in return for a
contingent payment from the seller if the reference entity has a credit event
such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay outstanding obligations or deteriorating
credit while the swap is outstanding. A seller of a credit default swap is said
to sell protection and thus collects the periodic fees and profits if the credit
of the reference entity remains stable or improves while the swap is outstanding
but the seller in a credit default swap contract would be required to pay an
agreed upon amount to the buyer in the event of an adverse credit event of the
reference entity. A credit-linked note is a synthetic security, typically issued
by a special purpose vehicle, that trades like a bond issued by the reference
entity but with the economics of the credit default swap. For this security, the
buyer of protection sells the note. The buyer of protection (note seller) will
pay periodic payments and profit if the reference entity defaults. Unlike the
swap, the buyer of protection in a credit-linked note will receive money at the
time of transaction from the sale of the note, and will return this money at the
contract's maturity if no credit event occurs. Conversely, the seller of
protection purchases the notes. As with a credit default swap, the note
purchaser (protection seller) receives periodic payments. Unlike the swap
transaction, the protection seller must pay for the note at the time of the
transaction and will collect this money at the contract's maturity if no credit
event occurs.

The Trust will enter into swap, cap or floor transactions only with
counterparties approved by the Adviser in accordance with guidelines established
by the Trust's Board of Trustees. The Adviser will monitor the creditworthiness
of counterparties to the Trust's swap, cap, floor and collar transactions on an
ongoing basis. If there is a default by the other party to such a transaction,
the Trust will have contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to
the transaction. The Trust may enter into swaps, caps, collars and floors on
either an asset-based or liability-based basis, and will usually enter into
swaps on a net basis, i.e., the two payment streams are netted out, with the
Trust receiving or paying, as the case may be, only the net amount of the two
payments. The net amount of the excess, if any, of the Trust's obligations over
its entitlements with respect to each swap will be accrued on a daily basis and
the Trust segregates an amount of cash and/or liquid securities having an
aggregate net asset value at least equal to the accrued excess. If the Trust
enters into a swap transaction on other than a net basis, the Trust would
segregate the full amount accrued on a daily basis of the Trust's obligations
with respect to the swap. To the extent the Trust sells (i.e. writes) caps,
floors and collars, it will segregate cash and/or liquid securities having an
aggregate net asset value at least equal to the full amount, accrued on a daily
basis, of the Trust's net obligations with respect to the caps, floors or
collars.

The use of swaps is a highly specialized activity which involves investment
techniques and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio
securities transactions. If the Adviser is incorrect in its forecasts of the
market values, interest rates and other applicable factors, the investment
performance of
                                                                               9

the Trust would diminish compared with what it would have been if these
investment techniques were not used. The use of swaps may also have the effect
of shifting the recognition of income between current and future periods.

COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS AND MULTICLASS PASS-THROUGH SECURITIES. The
Trust may invest in collateralized mortgage obligations ("CMOs"). CMOs are debt
obligations collateralized by mortgage loans or mortgage pass-through
securities. Typically, CMOs are collateralized by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC
certificates, but also may be collateralized by whole loans or private pass-
through securities (such collateral collectively hereinafter referred to as
"Mortgage Assets"). Multiclass pass-through securities are equity interests in a
trust composed of Mortgage Assets. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all
references herein to CMOs include multiclass pass-through securities. Payments
of principal of and interest on the Mortgage Assets, and any reinvestment income
thereon, provide the funds to pay debt service on the CMOs or make scheduled
distributions on the multiclass pass-through securities. CMOs deemed to be U.S.
government securities are those issued or guaranteed as to principal and
interest by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or
instrumentality of the U.S. government. The issuer of a series of CMOs may elect
to be treated as a Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (a "REMIC").

In a CMO, a series of bonds or certificates is issued in multiple classes. Each
class of CMOs, often referred to as a "tranche," is issued at a specific fixed
or floating coupon rate and has a stated maturity or final distribution date.
Principal prepayments on the Mortgage Assets may cause the CMOs to be retired
substantially earlier than their stated maturities or final distribution dates.
Interest is paid or accrues on all classes of the CMOs on a monthly, quarterly
or semi-annual basis. The principal of and interest on the Mortgage Assets may
be allocated among the several classes of a series of a CMO in innumerable ways.

The Trust may invest in, among others, parallel pay CMOs and Planned
Authorization Class CMOs ("PAC Bonds"). Parallel pay CMOs are structured to
provide payments of principal on each payment date to more than one class. These
simultaneous payments are taken into account in calculating the stated maturity
date or final distribution date of each class, which, as with other CMO
structures, must be retired by its stated maturity date or final distribution
date but may be retired earlier. PAC Bonds generally require payments of a
specified amount of principal on each payment date. PAC Bonds are always
parallel pay CMOs with the required principal payment on such securities having
the highest priority after interest has been paid to all classes. Substantially
all of the CMOs in which the Trust invests are PAC Bonds.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2006

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust") is registered as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to
provide high current income, while seeking to preserve shareholders' capital
through investment in a professionally managed diversified portfolio of high
yield, fixed income securities. The Trust commenced investment operations on
April 28, 1989.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Investments are stated at value using market quotations or
indications of value obtained from an independent pricing service. For those
securities where quotations or prices are not available, valuations are obtained
from yield data relating to instruments or securities with similar
characteristics in accordance with procedures established in good faith by the
Board of Trustees. Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
after payment is made. At December 31, 2006, the Trust had no when-issued or
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
The Trust may invest independently in repurchase agreements, or transfer
uninvested cash balances into a pooled cash account along with other investment
companies advised by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") or its
affiliates, the daily aggregate of which is invested in repurchase agreements.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
discount is accreted and premium is amortized over the expected life of each
applicable security. Other income is comprised primarily of consent fees.
Consent fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes in the terms of
debt instruments.

                                                                              23

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2006 continued

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset these losses against any future realized capital
gains. At December 31, 2006, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss
carryforward for tax purposes of $62,923,467 which will expire according to the
following schedule.

</Table>

    A portion of the capital loss carryforward above was acquired due to a
merger with another regulated investment company, please see Footnote 3 for
details. Furthermore, the utilization of the capital loss carryforward amount
above may be limited due to the merger.

    At December 31, 2006, the cost and related gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation are as follows:

</Table>

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust declares and pays monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed annually on a pro rata basis to common and preferred
shareholders. Distributions from net realized gains for book purposes may
include short-term capital gains, which are included in ordinary income for tax
purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005 was as follows:

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2006 continued

    Permanent differences, primarily due to a portion of capital loss
carryforward expiring in the current year and consent fee income received from
tender offers, resulted in the following reclassifications among the Trust's
components of net assets at December 31, 2006:

<Table>
<Caption>
ACCUMULATED UNDISTRIBUTED   ACCUMULATED NET
  NET INVESTMENT INCOME      REALIZED LOSS    PAID IN SURPLUS
<S>                         <C>               <C>
         $96,251              $1,937,476        $(2,033,727)
</Table>

    As of December 31, 2006, there were no components of distributable earnings
on a tax basis.

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses relating to wash sale
transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee payable
monthly of .70% of the average daily net assets including preferred shares of
the Trust. Effective July 1, 2006, the Adviser has agreed to waive investment
advisory fees equal to .05% of the average daily net assets including preferred
shares of the Trust. For the period July 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, the
Adviser voluntarily waived $36,442 of its investment advisory fees. This waiver
is voluntary and can be discontinued at any time.

    For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $17,800 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Legal Services, Accounting Services and Chief Compliance
Officer (CCO) Employment agreements, the Adviser provides accounting and legal
services and the CCO provides compliance services to the Trust. The costs of
these services are allocated to each trust. For the year ended December 31,
2006, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $46,600 representing Van
Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of
providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, as well as the salary,
benefits and related costs of the CCO and related support staff paid by Van
Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal Services agreement are reported
as part of "Professional Fees" on the Statement of Operations. Services provided
pursuant to the Accounting Services and CCO Employment agreement are reported as
part of "Accounting and Administrative Expenses" on the Statement of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

                                                                              25

    On July 29, 2005 the Trust acquired all of the assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen High Income Trust (ticker symbol VIT) through a tax free reorganization
approved by VIT shareholders on July 22, 2005. The Trust issued 10,784,621
common shares with a net asset value of $49,072,045 and 1,504 Auction Preferred
Shares (APS) with a liquidation value of $37,600,000 in exchange for VIT's net
assets. The shares of VIT were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of
0.786581 to 1 and 1 to 4, for common shares and APS, respectively. Net
unrealized depreciation of VIT as of July 29, 2005 was $1,265,478. The Trust
assumed VIT book to tax accretion differences, which resulted in a $263,880
increase to accumulated undistributed net investment income and a corresponding
decrease to net unrealized appreciation. Combined net assets applicable to
common shares on the day of reorganization were $85,969,581 and combined net
assets including preferred shares were $151,369,581. Included in these net
assets was a capital loss carryforward of $33,329,662, of which all can be
utilized by the acquiring Trust, deferred compensation and retirement plan
balance of $229,390 and non-accrual interest income of $16,968, all carried
forward from VIT. The Trust incurred merger expenses of $213,360, which
represent costs related to the preparation, printing, and distribution of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, Reorganization Agreement and registration statements
as well as legal, audit, and filing fees.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $65,439,151 and $65,520,013,
respectively.

5. PREFERRED SHARES

The Trust has outstanding 2,616 APS. Series A contains 1,112 shares and Series B
contains 1,504 shares. Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate on each
series is currently reset every 28 days through an auction process. The average
rate in effect on December 31, 2006 was 5.266%. During the year ended December
31, 2006, the rates ranged from 2.750% to 5.360%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- DECEMBER 31, 2006 continued

6. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

7. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Interpretation 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes--an interpretation
of FASB Statement 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes
by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before
being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 is effective for the fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax
years as of the effective date. Recent SEC guidance allows implementing FIN 48
in the fund NAV calculations as late as the fund's last NAV calculation in the
first required financial statement period. As a result, the Trust will
incorporate FIN 48 in its semi annual report on June 30, 2007. The impact to the
Trust's financial statements, if any, is currently being assessed.

    In addition, in September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Trust's financial statement disclosures.

                                                                              27

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of Van Kampen High Income Trust II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Van
Kampen High Income Trust II (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of
investments, as of December 31, 2006, the related statement of operations for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of December 31, 2006, by correspondence with the Trust's
custodian. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

    In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Van
Kampen High Income Trust II as of December 31, 2006, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

VAN KAMPEN HIGH INCOME TRUST II

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

    The dividend reinvestment plan offers you a prompt and simple way to
reinvest your dividends and capital gains distributions into additional shares
of your trust. Under the plan, the money you earn from dividends and capital
gains distributions will be reinvested automatically in more shares of your
trust, allowing you to potentially increase your investment over time. All
shareholders in the Van Kampen High Income Trust II are automatically enrolled
in the plan when shares are purchased, unless otherwise instructed.

PLAN BENEFITS

    - ADD TO YOUR ACCOUNT

    You may increase your shares in your trust easily and automatically with the
dividend reinvestment plan.

    - LOW TRANSACTION COSTS

    Costs are low because the new shares are bought in blocks and the brokerage
commission is shared among all participants.

    - CONVENIENCE

    You will receive a detailed account statement from Computershare Trust
Company, N.A., which administers the plan, whenever shares are reinvested for
you. The statement shows your total distributions, date of investment, shares
acquired, and price per share, as well as the total number of shares in your
reinvestment account.

    - SAFEKEEPING

    Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will hold the shares it has acquired for
you in safekeeping, which provides added protection against loss, theft, or
inadvertent destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a
certificate representing your reinvested shares be issued to you.

HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN

    If you own shares in your own name, you can participate directly in the
plan. If your shares are held in "street name"--in the name of your brokerage
firm, bank, or other financial institution--you must instruct that entity to
participate on your behalf. If they are unable to participate on your behalf,
you may request that they reregister your shares in your own name so that you
may enroll in the plan.

    If you choose to participate in the plan, whenever your trust declares a
dividend or capital gains distribution, it will be invested in additional shares
of your trust that are purchased on the open market.

                                                                              29

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN continued

HOW TO ENROLL

    To enroll in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan please visit vankampen.com or
call (800) 341-2929 or notify us in writing at the address below.

                          Van Kampen Closed-End Funds
                       Computershare Trust Company, N.A.
                                   P.O. Box 43011
                             Providence, RI 02940-3011
Please include your Fund name and account number and ensure that all
shareholders listed on the account sign these written instructions. Your
participation in the plan will begin with the next dividend or capital gains
distribution payable after Computershare Trust Company, N.A. receives your
authorization, as long as they receive it before the "record date," which is
generally ten business days before the dividend is paid. If your authorization
arrives after such record date, your participation in the plan will begin with
the following dividend or distribution.

COSTS OF THE PLAN

    There is no direct charge to you for reinvesting dividends and capital gains
distributions because the plan's fees are paid by your trust. However, you will
pay your portion of any brokerage commissions incurred when the new shares are
purchased on the open market. These brokerage commissions are typically less
than the standard brokerage charges for individual transactions, because shares
are purchased for all participants in blocks, resulting in lower commissions for
each individual participant. Any brokerage commissions or service fees are
averaged into the purchase price.

TAX IMPLICATIONS

    The automatic reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions does
not relieve you of any income tax that may be due on dividends or distributions.
You will receive tax information annually to help you prepare your federal and
state income tax returns.

HOW TO WITHDRAW FROM THE PLAN

    To withdraw from the Dividend Reinvestment Plan please visit vankampen.com

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN continued

    All shareholders listed on the account must sign any written withdrawal
instructions. If you withdraw, you have two choices for receiving your shares:

fractional shares without a charge.

    - CHECK

    We will sell all full and fractional shares and send the proceeds to your
address of record after deducting brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

    The Trust and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. may amend or terminate the
plan. Participants will receive written notice at least 30 days before the
effective date of any amendment. In the case of termination, participants will
receive written notice at least 30 days before the record date for the payment
of any dividend or capital gains distribution by your trust.

Item 3.  Audit Committee Financial Expert.

The Trust's Board of Trustees has determined that it has three "audit committee
financial experts" serving on its audit committee, each of whom are
"independent" Trustees : Rod Dammeyer, Jerry Choate and R. Craig Kennedy. Under
applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit committee

expert. The designation or identification of a person as an audit committee

imposed on such person as a member of the audit committee and Board of Trustees
in the absence of such designation or identification.

follows:

                              JOINT AUDIT COMMITTEE
                          AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                       PRE-APPROVAL POLICY AND PROCEDURES
                                     OF THE
                                VAN KAMPEN FUNDS

             AS ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003 AND AMENDED MAY 26, 2004 (1)


1.   STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

     The Audit Committee of the Board is required to review and, in its sole
discretion, pre-approve all Covered Services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors to the Fund and Covered Entities in order to assure that services
performed by the Independent Auditors do not impair the auditor's independence
from the Fund. (2)

     The SEC has issued rules specifying the types of services that an
independent auditor may not provide to its audit client, as well as the audit
committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditor. The
SEC's rules establish two different approaches to pre-approving services, which
the SEC considers to be equally valid. Proposed services either: may be
pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the
Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"); or require the specific pre-approval
of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee believes
that the combination of these two approaches in this Policy will result in an
effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services performed by the
Independent Auditors. As set forth in this Policy, unless a type of service has
received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
authority has been delegated) if it is to be provided by the Independent
Auditors. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted
amounts will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.

     For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether
such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The
Audit Committee will also consider whether the Independent Auditors are best
positioned to provide the most effective and efficient services, for reasons
such as its familiarity with the Fund's business, people, culture, accounting
systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance
the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. All such
factors will be considered as a whole, and no one factor should necessarily be
determinative.

     The Audit Committee is also mindful of the relationship between fees for
audit and non-audit services in deciding whether to pre-approve any such
services and may determine for each fiscal year, the appropriate ratio between
the total amount of fees for Audit, Audit-related and Tax services for the Fund
(including any Audit-related or Tax service fees for Covered Entities that were
subject to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
non-audit services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any
such services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).

     The appendices to this Policy describe the Audit, Audit-related, Tax and
All Other services that have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
The term of any general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval,
unless the Audit Committee considers and provides a different period and states
otherwise. The Audit Committee will annually review and pre-approve the services
that may be provided by the Independent Auditors without obtaining specific
pre-approval


- --------------------------
(1)  This Joint Audit Committee Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy
     and Procedures (the "Policy"), amended as of the date above, supercedes and
     replaces all prior versions that may have been amended from time to time.

(2)  Terms used in this Policy and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
     meanings as defined in the Joint Audit Committee Charter.

<PAGE>

from the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will add to or subtract from the
list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent
determinations.

     The purpose of this Policy is to set forth the policy and procedures by
which the Audit Committee intends to fulfill its responsibilities. It does not
delegate the Audit Committee's responsibilities to pre-approve services
performed by the Independent Auditors to management.

     The Fund's Independent Auditors have reviewed this Policy and believes that
implementation of the Policy will not adversely affect the Independent Auditors'
independence.


2.   DELEGATION

     As provided in the Act and the SEC's rules, the Audit Committee may
delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members.
The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational
purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next
scheduled meeting.


3.   AUDIT SERVICES

     The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual
financial statement audit and other procedures required to be performed by the
Independent Auditors to be able to form an opinion on the Fund's financial
statements. These other procedures include information systems and procedural
reviews and testing performed in order to understand and place reliance on the
systems of internal control, and consultations relating to the audit. The Audit
Committee will monitor the Audit services engagement as necessary, but no less
than on a quarterly basis, and will also approve, if necessary, any changes in
terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Fund structure
or other items.

     In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit
Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other Audit
services, which are those services that only the Independent Auditors reasonably
can provide. Other Audit services may include statutory audits and services
associated with SEC registration statements (on Forms N-1A, N-2, N-3, N-4,
etc.), periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or other
documents issued in connection with securities offerings.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit services in Appendix B.1.
All other Audit services not listed in Appendix B.1 must be specifically
pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to
which pre-approval has been delegated).


4.   AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

     Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Fund's
financial statements or, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities' financial statements, or that are traditionally performed by the
Independent Auditors. Because the Audit Committee believes that the provision of
Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor and is
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, the Audit Committee may
grant general pre-approval to Audit-related services. Audit-related services
include, among others, accounting consultations related to accounting, financial
reporting or disclosure matters not classified as "Audit services"; assistance
with understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures
related to accounting and/or billing records required to respond to or comply
with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting matters; and assistance with
internal control reporting requirements under Forms N-SAR and/or N-CSR.

<PAGE>

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the Audit-related services in Appendix
B.2. All other Audit-related services not listed in Appendix B.2 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

5.   TAX SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes that the Independent Auditors can provide Tax
services to the Fund and, to the extent they are Covered Services, the Covered
Entities, such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing
the auditor's independence, and the SEC has stated that the Independent Auditors
may provide such services. Hence, the Audit Committee believes it may grant
general pre-approval to those Tax services that have historically been provided
by the Independent Auditors, that the Audit Committee has reviewed and believes
would not impair the independence of the Independent Auditors, and that are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee
will not permit the retention of the Independent Auditors in connection with a
transaction initially recommended by the Independent Auditors, the sole business
purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be
supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Audit
Committee will consult with Director of Tax or outside counsel to determine that
the tax planning and reporting positions are consistent with this policy.

     Pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee has pre-approved
the Tax Services in Appendix B.3. All Tax services involving large and complex
transactions not listed in Appendix B.3 must be specifically pre-approved by the
Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit Committee to which pre-approval
has been delegated), including tax services proposed to be provided by the
Independent Auditors to any executive officer or trustee/director/managing
general partner of the Fund, in his or her individual capacity, where such
services are paid for by the Fund (generally applicable only to internally
managed investment companies).

6.   ALL OTHER SERVICES

     The Audit Committee believes, based on the SEC's rules prohibiting the
Independent Auditors from providing specific non-audit services, that other
types of non-audit services are permitted. Accordingly, the Audit Committee
believes it may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and
recurring services, would not impair the independence of the auditor and are
consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence.

     The Audit Committee has pre-approved the All Other services in Appendix
B.4. Permissible All Other services not listed in Appendix B.4 must be
specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (or by any member of the Audit
Committee to which pre-approval has been delegated).

     A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
policy as Appendix B.5. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
consulted to determine the precise definitions of these services and the
applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.

7.   PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS OR BUDGETED AMOUNTS

     Pre-approval fee levels or budgeted amounts for all services to be provided
by the Independent Auditors will be established annually by the Audit Committee.
Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts will require specific
pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is mindful of the
overall relationship of fees for audit and non-audit services in determining
whether to pre-approve any such services. For each fiscal year, the Audit
Committee may determine the appropriate ratio between the total amount of fees
for Audit, Audit-related, and Tax services for the Fund (including any
Audit-related or Tax services fees for Covered Entities subject to
pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible non-audit
services classified as All Other services for the Fund (including any such
services for Covered Entities subject to pre-approval).


<PAGE>

8.   PROCEDURES

     All requests or applications for services to be provided by the Independent
Auditors that do not require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be
submitted to the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and must include a detailed
description of the services to be rendered. The Fund's Chief Financial Officer
will determine whether such services are included within the list of services
that have received the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit
Committee will be informed on a timely basis of any such services rendered by
the Independent Auditors. Requests or applications to provide services that
require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit
Committee by both the Independent Auditors and the Fund's Chief Financial
Officer, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the
request or application is consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor
independence.

     The Audit Committee has designated the Fund's Chief Financial Officer to
monitor the performance of all services provided by the Independent Auditors and
to determine whether such services are in compliance with this Policy. The
Fund's Chief Financial Officer will report to the Audit Committee on a periodic
basis on the results of its monitoring. A sample report is included as Appendix
B.7. Both the Fund's Chief Financial Officer and management will immediately
report to the chairman of the Audit Committee any breach of this Policy that
comes to the attention of the Fund's Chief Financial Officer or any member of
management.

9.   ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Audit Committee has determined to take additional measures on an annual
basis to meet its responsibility to oversee the work of the Independent Auditors
and to assure the auditor's independence from the Fund, such as reviewing a
formal written statement from the Independent Auditors delineating all
relationships between the Independent Auditors and the Fund, consistent with
Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the Independent Auditors
its methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

10.  COVERED ENTITIES

     Covered Entities include the Fund's investment adviser(s) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Fund's investment
adviser(s) that provides ongoing services to the Fund(s). Beginning with
non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Fund's
audit committee must pre-approve non-audit services provided not only to the
Fund but also to the Covered Entities if the engagements relate directly to the
operations and financial reporting of the Fund. This list of Covered Entities
would include:

     -    Van Kampen Investments Inc.
     -    Van Kampen Asset Management
     -    Van Kampen Advisors Inc.
     -    Van Kampen Funds Inc.
     -    Van Kampen Investor Services Inc.
     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc.
     -    Morgan Stanley Trust Company
     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Ltd.
     -    Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company
     -    Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Company Ltd.

(e)(2) Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered into on or after May
6, 2003, the audit committee also is required to pre-approve services to Covered
Entities to the extent that the services

of the Registrant. 100% of such services were pre-approved by the audit
committee pursuant to the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures
(included herein).

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

The Trust's and its investment advisor's Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
are as follows:

                      MORGAN STANLEY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

I.   POLICY STATEMENT

Introduction - Morgan Stanley Investment Management's ("MSIM") policy and
procedures for voting proxies ("Policy") with respect to securities held in the
accounts of clients applies to those MSIM entities that provide discretionary
investment management services and for which a MSIM entity has authority to vote
proxies. The Policy will be reviewed and, updated, as necessary, to address new
or revised proxy voting issues. The MSIM entities covered by the Policy
currently include the following: Morgan Stanley Investment Advisors Inc., Morgan
Stanley AIP GP LP, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc., Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Limited, Morgan Stanley Investment Management Company,
Morgan Stanley Asset & Investment Trust Management Co., Limited, Morgan Stanley
Investment Management Private Limited, Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners GP LP,
Morgan Stanley Hedge Fund Partners LP, Van Kampen Asset Management, and Van
Kampen Advisors Inc. (each an "MSIM Affiliate" and collectively referred to as
the "MSIM Affiliates").

Each MSIM Affiliate will use its best efforts to vote proxies as part of its
authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. With respect to the
MSIM registered management investment companies (Van Kampen, Institutional and
Advisor Funds)(collectively referred to herein as the "MSIM Funds"), each MSIM
Affiliate will vote proxies under this Policy (except for the Morgan Stanley KLD
Social Index Fund, which votes proxies pursuant to the Institutional Shareholder
Services' Social Investment Research Proxy Voting Guidelines) pursuant to
authority granted under its applicable investment advisory agreement or, in the
absence of such authority, as authorized by the Board of


<PAGE>

Directors or Trustees of the MSIM Funds. A MSIM Affiliate will not vote proxies
if the "named fiduciary" for an ERISA account has reserved the authority for
itself, or in the case of an account not governed by ERISA, the investment
management or investment advisory agreement does not authorize the MSIM
Affiliate to vote proxies. MSIM Affiliates will, in a prudent and diligent
manner, vote proxies in the best interests of clients, including beneficiaries
of and participants in a client's benefit plan(s) for which the MSIM Affiliates
manage assets, consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term investment
returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, a client or its
fiduciary may provide a MSIM Affiliate with a proxy voting policy. In these
situations, the MSIM Affiliate will comply with the client's policy.

Proxy Research Services - Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") and Glass
Lewis (together with other proxy research providers as MSIM Affiliates may
retain from time to time, the "Research Providers") are independent advisers
that specialize in providing a variety of fiduciary-level proxy-related services
to institutional investment managers, plan sponsors, custodians, consultants,
and other institutional investors. The services provided include in-depth
research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While the MSIM
Affiliates may review and utilize the recommendations of the Research Providers
in making proxy voting decisions, they are in no way obligated to follow such
recommendations. In addition to research, ISS provides vote execution,
reporting, and recordkeeping. MSIM's Proxy Review Committee (see Section IV.A.
below) will carefully monitor and supervise the services provided by the
Research Providers.

Voting Proxies for Certain Non-U.S. Companies - While the proxy voting process
is well established in the United States and other developed markets with a
number of tools and services available to assist an investment manager, voting
proxies of non-U.S. companies located in certain jurisdictions, particularly
emerging markets, may involve a number of problems that may restrict or prevent
a MSIM Affiliate's ability to vote such proxies. These problems include, but are
not limited to: (i) proxy statements and ballots being written in a language
other than English; (ii) untimely and/or inadequate notice of shareholder
meetings; (iii) restrictions on the ability of holders outside the issuer's
jurisdiction of organization to exercise votes; (iv) requirements to vote
proxies in person, (v) the imposition of restrictions on the sale of the
securities for a period of time in proximity to the shareholder meeting; and
(vi) requirements to provide local agents with power of attorney to facilitate
the MSIM Affiliate's voting instructions. As a result, clients' non-U.S. proxies
will be voted on a best efforts basis only, after weighing the costs and
benefits to MSIM's clients of voting such proxies, consistent with the Client
Proxy Standard. ISS has been retained to provide assistance to the MSIM
Affiliates in connection with voting their clients' non-U.S. proxies.

II.  GENERAL PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

To ensure consistency in voting proxies on behalf of its clients, MSIM
Affiliates will follow (subject to any exception set forth herein) this Policy,
including the guidelines set forth below. These guidelines address a broad range
of issues, including board size and composition, executive compensation,
anti-takeover proposals, capital structure proposals and social responsibility
issues and are meant to be general voting parameters on issues that arise most
frequently. The MSIM Affiliates, however, may, pursuant to the procedures set
forth in Section IV. below, vote in a manner that is not in accordance with the
following general guidelines, provided the vote is approved by the Proxy Review
Committee and is consistent with the Client Proxy Standard. Morgan Stanley AIP
GP LP will follow the procedures as described in Appendix A. A MSIM Affiliate
will not generally vote a proxy if it has sold the affected security between the
record date and the meeting date.


<PAGE>


III. GUIDELINES

A.   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS. The following proposals will generally be
voted as indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review
Committee.

     i.   General.

     1.   Generally, routine management proposals will be supported. The
               following are examples of routine management proposals:


          -    Approval of financial statements, director and auditor reports.

          -    General updating/corrective amendments to the charter.

          -    Proposals related to the conduct of the annual meeting, except
               those proposals that relate to the "transaction of such other
               business which may come before the meeting."

     2.   Proposals to eliminate cumulative voting generally will be supported;
               proposals to establish cumulative voting in the election of
               directors will not be supported.

     3.   Proposals requiring confidential voting and independent tabulation of
               voting results will be supported.

     4.   Proposals requiring a U.S. company to have a separate Chairman and CEO
               will not be supported. Proposals requiring non-U.S. companies to
               have a separate Chairman and CEO will be supported.

     5.   Proposals by management of non-U.S. companies regarding items that are
               clearly related to the regular course of business will be
               supported.

     6.   Proposals to require the company to expense stock options will be
               supported.

     7.   Open-ended requests for adjournment generally will not be supported.
               However, where management specifically states the reason for
               requesting an adjournment and the requested adjournment is
               necessary to permit a proposal that would otherwise be supported
               under this Policy to be carried out (i.e. an uncontested
               corporate transaction), the adjournment request will be
               supported.

     8.   Proposals to declassify the Board of Directors (if management supports
               a classified board) generally will not be supported.

     9.   Proposal requiring that the company prepare reports that are costly to
               provide or that would require duplicative efforts or expenditures
               that are of a non-business nature or would provide no pertinent
               information from the perspective of institutional shareholders
               generally will not be supported.

     ii.  Election of Directors. In situations where no conflict exists and
     where no specific governance deficiency has been noted, unless otherwise
     determined by the




<PAGE>

     Proxy Review Committee, proxies will be voted in support of nominees of
     management.

     1.   The following proposals generally will be supported: -

          -    Proposals requiring that a certain percentage (up to 66 2/3%) of
               the company's board members be independent directors.

          -    Proposals requiring that members of the company's compensation,
               nominating and audit committees be comprised of independent or
               unaffiliated directors.


     2.   Unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee, a withhold
          vote will be made in the following circumstances:

          (a)  If a company's board is not comprised of a majority of
               disinterested directors, a withhold vote will be made for
               interested directors. A director nominee may be deemed to be
               interested if the nominee has, or any time during the previous
               five years had, a relationship with the issuer (e.g., investment
               banker, counsel or other professional service provider, or
               familial relationship with a senior officer of the issuer) that
               may impair his or her independence;

          (b)  If a nominee who is interested is standing for election as a
               member of the company's compensation, nominating or audit
               committees;

          (c)  A direct conflict exists between the interests of the nominee and
               the public shareholders;

          (d)  Where the nominees standing for election have not taken action to
               implement generally accepted governance practices for which there
               is a "bright line" test. These would include elimination of dead
               hand or slow hand poison pills, requiring audit, compensation or
               nominating committees to be composed of independent directors and
               requiring a majority independent board;

          (e)  A nominee has failed to attend at least 75% of board meetings
               within a given year without a reasonable excuse; or

          (f)  A nominee serves on the board of directors for more than six
               companies (excluding investment companies).

     iii. Auditors

     1.   Generally, management proposals for selection or ratification of
          auditors will be supported. However, such proposals may not be
          supported if the fees paid to auditors are excessive. Generally, to
          determine if such fees are excessive, a 50% test will be applied:
          i.e., non-audit fees should be less than 50% of the total fees paid to
          the auditor.

<PAGE>

     2.   Proposals requiring auditors to attend the annual meeting of
          shareholders will be supported.

     3.   Proposals to indemnify auditors will not be supported.

     iv.  Anti-Takeover Matters

     1.   Proposals to modify or rescind existing supermajority vote
          requirements to amend the charter or bylaws will be supported;
          proposals to amend by-laws to require a supermajority shareholder vote
          to pass or repeal certain provisions will not be supported.

     2.   Proposals relating to the adoption of anti-greenmail provisions will
          be supported, provided that the proposal: (i) defines greenmail; (ii)
          prohibits buyback offers to large block holders (holders of at least
          1% of the outstanding shares and in certain cases, a greater amount,
          as determined by the Proxy Review Committee) not made to all
          shareholders or not approved by disinterested shareholders; and (iii)
          contains no anti-takeover measures or other provisions restricting the
          rights of shareholders.

     3.   Proposals requiring shareholder approval or ratification of a
          shareholder rights plan or poison pill will be supported.

B.   CAPITALIZATION CHANGES. The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     1.   The following proposals generally will be supported:

          -    Proposals relating to capitalization changes that eliminate other
               classes of stock and/or eliminate unequal voting rights.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorization of existing classes of
               common stock (or securities convertible into common stock) if:
               (i) a clear and legitimate business purpose is stated; (ii) the
               number of shares requested is reasonable in relation to the
               purpose for which authorization is requested; and (iii) the
               authorization does not exceed 100% of shares currently authorized
               and at least 30% of the new authorization will be outstanding.

          -    Proposals to create a new class of preferred stock or for
               issuances of preferred stock up to 50% of issued capital.

          -    Proposals for share repurchase plans.

          -    Proposals to reduce the number of authorized shares of common or
               preferred stock, or to eliminate classes of preferred stock.

          -    Proposals to effect stock splits.

          -    Proposals to effect reverse stock splits if management
               proportionately reduces the authorized share amount set forth in
               the corporate charter. Reverse stock splits that do not adjust
               proportionately to the authorized share amount generally will be
               approved if the resulting increase in


<PAGE>

               authorized shares coincides with the proxy guidelines set forth
               above for common stock increases.

     2.   The following proposals generally will not be supported
          (notwithstanding management support).

          -    Proposals relating to capitalization changes that add classes of
               stock which substantially dilute the voting interests of existing
               shareholders.

          -    Proposals to increase the authorized number of shares of existing
               classes of stock that carry preemptive rights or supervoting
               rights.

          -    Proposals to create "blank check" preferred stock.

          -    Proposals relating to changes in capitalization by 100% or more.

C.   COMPENSATION. The following proposals generally will be voted as indicated
below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     1.   The following proposals generally will be supported:

          -    Proposals relating to director fees, provided the amounts are not
               excessive relative to other companies in the country or industry.

          -    Proposals for employee stock purchase plans that permit discounts
               up to 15%, but only for grants that are part of a broad-based
               employee plan, including all non-executive employees.

          -    Proposals for the establishment of employee stock option plans
               and other employee ownership plans, provided that our research
               does not indicate that approval of the plan would be against
               shareholder interest.

          -    Proposals for the establishment of employee retirement and
               severance plans, provided that our research does not indicate
               that approval of the plan would be against shareholder interest.

     2.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of all severance
          agreements will not be supported, however, proposals that require
          shareholder approval for agreements in excess of three times the
          annual compensation (salary and bonus) generally will be supported.

     3.   Blanket proposals requiring shareholder approval of executive
          compensation generally will not be supported.

     4.   Proposals that request or require disclosure of executive compensation
          in addition to the disclosure required by the Securities and Exchange
          Commission ("SEC") regulations generally will not be supported.


D.   OTHER RECURRING ITEMS. The following proposals generally will be voted as
indicated below, unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.


<PAGE>
     1.   Proposals to add restrictions related to social, political,
          environmental or special interest issues that do not relate directly
          to the business of the company and which do not appear to be directed
          specifically to the business or financial interest of the company
          generally will not be supported.

     2.   Proposals requiring adherence to workplace standards that are not
          required or customary in market(s) to which the proposals relate will
          not be supported.


E.   ITEMS TO BE REVIEWED BY THE PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

The following types of non-routine proposals, which potentially may have a
substantive financial or best interest impact on an issuer, will be voted as
determined by the Proxy Review Committee.

     i.   Corporate Transactions

          -    Proposals relating to mergers, acquisitions and other special
               corporate transactions (i.e., takeovers, spin-offs, sales of
               assets, reorganizations, restructurings and recapitalizations)
               will be examined on a case-by-case basis. In all cases, Research
               Providers' research and analysis will be used along with MSIM
               Affiliates' research and analysis, including, among other things,
               MSIM internal company-specific knowledge. Proposals for mergers
               or other significant transactions that are friendly and approved
               by the Research Providers generally will be supported where there
               is no portfolio manager objection and where there is no material
               conflict of interest and in those instances will not need to be
               reviewed by the Proxy Review Committee.

     ii.  Compensation

          -    Proposals relating to change-in-control provisions in non-salary
               compensation plans, employment contracts, and severance
               agreements that benefit management and would be costly to
               shareholders if triggered. With respect to proposals related to
               severance and change of control situations, MSIM Affiliates will
               support a maximum of three times salary and bonus.

          -    Proposals relating to Executive/Director stock option plans.
               Generally, stock option plans should be incentive based. The
               Proxy Review Committee will evaluate the the quantitative
               criteria used by a Research Provider when considering such
               Research Provider's recommendation. If the Proxy Review Committee
               determines that the criteria used by the Research Provider is
               reasonable, the proposal will be supported if it falls within a
               5% band above the Research Provider's threshold.

          -    Compensation proposals that allow for discounted stock options
               that have not been offered to employees in general.

     iii. Other

          -    Proposals for higher dividend payouts.


<PAGE>


          -    Proposals recommending set retirement ages or requiring specific
               levels of stock ownership by directors.

          -    Proposals for election of directors, where a director nominee is
               related to MSIM (i.e. on an MSIM Fund's Board of
               Directors/Trustees or part of MSIM senior management) must be
               considered by the Proxy Review Committee. If the proposal relates
               to a director nominee who is on a Van Kampen Fund's Board of
               Directors/Trustees, to the extent that the shares of the relevant
               company are held by a Van Kampen Fund, the Van Kampen Board shall
               vote the proxies with respect to those shares, to the extent
               practicable. In the event that the Committee cannot contact the
               Van Kampen Board in advance of the shareholder meeting, the
               Committee will vote such shares pursuant to the Proxy Voting
               Policy.

          -    Proposals requiring diversity of board membership relating to
               broad based social, religious or ethnic groups.

          -    Proposals to limit directors' liability and/or broaden
               indemnification of directors. Generally, the Proxy Review
               Committee will support such proposals provided that the officers
               and directors are eligible for indemnification and liability
               protection if they have acted in good faith on company business
               and were found innocent of any civil or criminal charges for
               duties performed on behalf of the company.

F.   FUND OF FUNDS. Certain Funds advised by an MSIM Affiliate invest only in
other MSIM funds. If an underlying fund has a shareholder meeting, in order to
avoid any potential conflict of interest, such proposals will be voted in the
same proportion as the votes of the other shareholders of the underlying fund,
unless otherwise determined by the Proxy Review Committee.


IV.  ADMINISTRATION OF POLICY

A.   PROXY REVIEW COMMITTEE

     1.   The MSIM Proxy Review Committee ("Committee") is responsible for
          creating and implementing the Policy and, in this regard, has
          expressly adopted it.

          (a)  The Committee, which is appointed by MSIM's Chief Investment
               Officer ("CIO"), consists of senior investment professionals who
               represent the different investment disciplines and geographic
               locations of the firm. The Committee is responsible for
               establishing MSIM's Policy and determining how MSIM will vote
               proxies on an ongoing basis.

          (b)  The Committee will periodically review and have the authority to
               amend, as necessary, the Policy and establish and direct voting
               positions consistent with the Client Proxy Standard.

          (c)  The Committee will meet at least monthly to (among other
               matters): (1) address any outstanding issues relating to the
               Policy and (2) review proposals at upcoming shareholder meetings
               of MSIM portfolio

<PAGE>

               companies in accordance with this Policy including, as
               appropriate, the voting results of prior shareholder meetings of
               the same issuer where a similar proposal was presented to
               shareholders. The Committee, or its designee, will timely
               communicate to ISS MSIM's Policy (and any amendments to them
               and/or any additional guidelines or procedures it may adopt).

          (d)  The Committee will meet on an ad hoc basis to (among other
               matters): (1) authorize "split voting" (i.e., allowing certain
               shares of the same issuer that are the subject of the same proxy
               solicitation and held by one or more MSIM portfolios to be voted
               differently than other shares) and/or "override voting" (i.e.,
               voting all MSIM portfolio shares in a manner contrary to the
               Policy); (2) review and approve upcoming votes, as appropriate,
               for matters for which specific direction has been provided in
               this Policy; and (3) determine how to vote matters for which
               specific direction has not been provided in this Policy. Split
               votes generally will not be approved within a single Global
               Investor Group investment team. The Committee may take into
               account Research Providers' recommendations and research as well
               as any other relevant information they may request or receive,
               including portfolio manager and/or analyst research, as
               applicable. Generally, proxies related to securities held in
               accounts that are managed pursuant to quantitative, index or
               index-like strategies ("Index Strategies") will be voted in the
               same manner as those held in actively managed accounts. Because
               accounts managed using Index Strategies are passively managed
               accounts, research from portfolio managers and/or analysts
               related to securities held in these accounts may not be
               available. If the affected securities are held only in accounts
               that are managed pursuant to Index Strategies, and the proxy
               relates to a matter that is not described in this Policy, the
               Committee will consider all available information from the
               Research Providers, and to the extent that the holdings are
               significant, from the portfolio managers and/or analysts.

          (e)  In addition to the procedures discussed above, if the Committee
               determines that an issue raises a potential material conflict of
               interest, or gives rise to the appearance of a potential material
               conflict of interest, the Committee will request a special
               committee to review, and recommend a course of action with
               respect to, the conflict(s) in question ("Special Committee").
               The Special Committee shall be comprised of the Chairperson of
               the Proxy Review Committee, the Compliance Director for the area
               of the firm involved or his/her designee, a senior portfolio
               manager (if practicable, one who is a member of the Proxy Review
               Committee) designated by the Proxy Review Committee, and MSIM's
               Chief Investment Officer or his/her designee. The Special
               Committee may request the assistance of MSIM's General Counsel or
               his/her designee and will have sole discretion to cast a vote. In
               addition to the research provided by Research Providers, the
               Special Committee may request analysis from MSIM Affiliate
               investment professionals and outside sources to the extent it
               deems appropriate.


<PAGE>


          (f)  The Committee and the Special Committee, or their designee(s),
               will document in writing all of their decisions and actions,
               which documentation will be maintained by the Committee and the
               Special Committee, or their designee(s), for a period of at least
               6 years. To the extent these decisions relate to a security held
               by a MSIM U.S. registered investment company, the Committee and
               Special Committee, or their designee(s), will report their
               decisions to each applicable Board of Trustees/Directors of those
               investment companies at each Board's next regularly scheduled
               Board meeting. The report will contain information concerning
               decisions made by the Committee and Special Committee during the
               most recently ended calendar quarter immediately preceding the
               Board meeting.

          (g)  The Committee and Special Committee, or their designee(s), will
               timely communicate to applicable portfolio managers, the
               Compliance Departments and, as necessary, to ISS, decisions of
               the Committee and Special Committee so that, among other things,
               ISS will vote proxies consistent with their decisions.

     B.   IDENTIFICATION OF MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

          1.   If there is a possibility that a vote may involve a material
               conflict of interest, the vote must be decided by the Special
               Committee in consultation with MSIM's General Counsel or his/her
               designee.

          2.   A material conflict of interest could exist in the following
               situations, among others:

          (a)  The issuer soliciting the vote is a client of MSIM or an
               affiliate of MSIM and the vote is on a material matter affecting
               the issuer;

          (b)  The proxy relates to Morgan Stanley common stock or any other
               security issued by Morgan Stanley or its affiliates; or

          (c)  Morgan Stanley has a material pecuniary interest in the matter
               submitted for a vote (e.g., acting as a financial advisor to a
               party to a merger or acquisition for which Morgan Stanley will be
               paid a success fee if completed).

     C.   PROXY VOTING REPORTS

          (a)  MSIM will promptly provide a copy of this Policy to any client
               requesting them. MSIM will also, upon client request, promptly
               provide a report indicating how each proxy was voted with respect
               to securities held in that client's account.

          (b)  MSIM's legal department is responsible for filing an annual Form
               N-PX on behalf of each registered management investment company
               for which such filing is required, indicating how all proxies
               were voted with respect to such investment company's holdings.

Item 8.  Portfolio Managers of Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

                                TRUST MANAGEMENT

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT. As of the date of this report, the Trust is managed by
members of the Adviser's Taxable Fixed Income team. The team consists of
portfolio managers and analysts. Current members of the team jointly and
primarily responsible for the day-to-day management of the Trust's portfolio are
Gordon W. Loery and Joshua Givelber, Executive Directors of the Adviser.

Mr. Loery has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since June 1990 and joined the team managing the Trust in July 2001.
Mr. Givelber has been associated with the Adviser in an investment management
capacity since June 1999 and joined the team managing the Trust in April 2003.

The composition of the team may change without notice from time to time.

OTHER ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS

The following information is as of December 31, 2006

Mr. Loery managed eight mutual funds with a total of approximately $1.4 billion
in assets; three pooled investment vehicles other than mutual funds with a total
of approximately $418.6 million; and one other account with a total of
approximately $1 thousand.

Mr. Givelber managed seven mutual funds with a total of approximately $1.5
billion in assets; no pooled investment vehicles other than mutual funds; and no
other accounts.

Because the portfolio managers manage assets for other investment companies,
pooled investment vehicles, and/or other accounts (including institutional
clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals), there may be an
incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest.
For instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher
than the fee it receives from the Fund, or it may receive a performance-based
fee on certain accounts. In those instances, the portfolio manager may have an
incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the
Fund. The portfolio managers of the Fund do not currently manage assets of other
investment companies, pooled investment vehicles or other accounts that charge a
performance fee. The Adviser has adopted trade allocation and other policies and
procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to address these and other
conflicts of interest.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION STRUCTURE

Portfolio managers receive a combination of base compensation and discretionary
compensation, comprised of a cash bonus and several deferred compensation
programs described below. The methodology used to determine portfolio manager
compensation is applied across all accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

Base salary compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base salary
compensation based on the level of their position with the Adviser.

Discretionary compensation. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers
may receive discretionary compensation.

Discretionary compensation can include:

- - Cash Bonus.

<PAGE>

- - Morgan Stanley's Equity Incentive Compensation Program (EICP) awards -- a
mandatory program that defers a portion of discretionary year-end compensation
into restricted stock units or other awards based on Morgan Stanley common stock
that are subject to vesting and other conditions.

- - Investment Management Alignment Plan (IMAP) awards -- a mandatory program that
defers a portion of discretionary year-end compensation and notionally invests
it in designated Funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates. The award is
subject to vesting and other conditions. Portfolio managers must notionally
invest a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 100% of the IMAP deferral into a
combination of the designated open-end mutual funds they manage that are
included in the IMAP Fund menu, which may or may not include the Fund.

- - Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans -- voluntary programs that permit
certain employees to elect to defer a portion of their discretionary year-end
compensation and directly or notionally invest the deferred amount: (1) across a
range of designated investment Funds, including Funds advised by the Adviser or
its affiliates; and/or (2) in Morgan Stanley stock units.

Several factors determine discretionary compensation, which can vary by
portfolio management team and circumstances. In order of relative importance,
these factors include:

- - Investment performance. A portfolio manager's compensation is linked to the
pre-tax investment performance of the funds/accounts managed by the portfolio
manager. Investment performance is calculated for one-, three- and five-year
periods measured against a fund's/account's primary benchmark, indices and/or
peer groups where applicable. Generally, the greatest weight is placed on the
three- and five-year periods.

- - Revenues generated by the investment companies, pooled investment vehicles and
other accounts managed by the portfolio manager.

- - Contribution to the business objectives of the Adviser.

- - The dollar amount of assets managed by the portfolio manager.

- - Market compensation survey research by independent third parties.

- - Other qualitative factors, such as contributions to client objectives.

- - Performance of Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley Investment Management, and
the overall performance of the investment team(s) of which the portfolio manager
is a member.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
                             ADOPTED JULY 23, 2003,

      AS AMENDED AUGUST 10, 2005, SEPTEMBER 22, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 22, 2006



I.   This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the investment companies within the
     Van Kampen complex identified in Exhibit A (collectively, "Funds" and each,
     a "Fund") applies to each Fund's Principal Executive Officer, President,
     Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
     functions) ("Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit B) for
     the purpose of promoting:

     -    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships.

     -    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     -    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     -    prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     -    accountability for adherence to the Code.

          Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of
the Code should be referred to the General Counsel or his/her designee (who is
set forth in Exhibit C).

II.  COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the General Counsel determines that any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.


<PAGE>


     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the investment adviser, or for both), be involved
in establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser and is consistent with the performance by
the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed
in conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Funds' Boards of
Directors/Trustees ("Boards") that the Covered Officers may also be officers or
employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this or other
codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     -    use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
          influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
          indirectly);

     -    cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; or

     -    use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
          contemplated for, or actions proposed to be taken by, the Fund to
          trade personally or cause others to trade personally in contemplation
          of the market effect of such transactions.

     Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report to the
General Counsel all affiliations or significant business relationships outside
the Morgan Stanley complex and must update the report annually.

     Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the General
Counsel and communicated to the relevant Fund or Fund's Board. Any activity or
relationship that would present such a conflict for a Covered Officer would
likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if an immediate member of
the Covered Officer's family living in the same household engages in such an
activity or has such a relationship. Examples of these include:

     -    service or significant business relationships as a director on the
          board of any public or private company;

     -    accepting directly or indirectly, anything of value, including gifts
          and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings, not
          including occasional meals or tickets for theatre or sporting events
          or other similar entertainment;


<PAGE>

          provided it is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
          time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

     -    any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, or any affiliated person
          thereof; and

     -    a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     -    Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself/herself with the
          disclosure and compliance requirements generally applicable to the
          Funds;

     -    each Covered Officer must not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
          to misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or
          outside the Fund, including to the Fund's Directors/Trustees and
          auditors, or to governmental regulators and self-regulatory
          organizations;

     -    each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area
          of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
          Funds and their investment advisers with the goal of promoting full,
          fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports
          and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
          public communications made by the Funds; and

     -    it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
          with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules
          and regulations.

IV.  REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     -    upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
          Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     -    annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he has complied with the
          requirements of the Code;

     -    not retaliate against any other Covered Officer, other officer or any
          employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
          potential violations that are made in good faith; and

     -    notify the General Counsel promptly if he/she knows or suspects of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

     The General Counsel is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any

<PAGE>

particular situation. However, any waivers(3) sought by a Covered Officer must
be considered by the Board of the relevant Fund or Funds.

     The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

     -    the General Counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to him;

     -    if, after such investigation, the General Counsel believes that no
          violation has occurred, the General Counsel is not required to take
          any further action;

     -    any matter that the General Counsel believes is a violation will be
          reported to the relevant Fund's Audit Committee;

     -    if the directors/trustees/managing general partners who are not
          "interested persons" as defined by the Investment Company Act (the
          "Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners") of the
          relevant Fund concur that a violation has occurred, they will consider
          appropriate action, which may include review of, and appropriate
          modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification to
          appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
          recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer or other appropriate
          disciplinary actions;

     -    the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General Partners of the
          relevant Fund will be responsible for granting waivers of this Code,
          as appropriate; and

     -    any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
forms applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' investment advisers, principal
underwriters, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the
behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code unless any provision of this Code conflicts
with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the requirements of such
law will govern. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and principal
underwriters' codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act
and Morgan Stanley's Code of Ethics are separate requirements applying to the
Covered Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VI.  AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibits A, B or C,
must be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board of each Fund,
including a majority of Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing General
Partners.


- --------------------

(3)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics."



<PAGE>


VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY

      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the Independent Directors/Trustees/Managing
General Partners of the relevant Fund or Funds and their counsel, the relevant
Fund or Funds and their counsel and the relevant investment adviser and its
counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion



I have read and understand the terms of the above Code. I recognize the
responsibilities and obligations incurred by me as a result of my being subject
to the Code. I hereby agree to abide by the above Code.
