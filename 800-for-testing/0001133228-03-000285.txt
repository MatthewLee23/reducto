R. JAY GERKEN, CFA

Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer

Dear Shareholder,

The philosopher Bertrand Russell famously remarked that, "Change is one thing,
progress is another." You will notice in the following pages that we have begun
to implement some changes to your shareholder report and we will be reflecting
other changes in future reports. Our aim is to make meaningful improvements in
reporting on the management of your Fund and its performance, not just to enact
change for change's sake. Please bear with us during this transition period.

We know that you have questions about fund managers' decisions and plans, and we
want to be sure that you have easy access to the information you need. Keeping
investors informed is, and always will be, one of my top priorities as Chairman
of your Fund. To that end, we encourage you to contact Investor Relations at
1-888-735-6507. We have also included a separate Manager Commentary along with
this report, which we hope will give you a better understanding of your Fund and
its management.

As always, thank you for entrusting your assets to us. We look forward to
helping you continue to meet your financial goals.

Sincerely,


/s/ R. Jay Gerken


R. Jay Gerken, CFA
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

Take Advantage of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan!

As an investor in the Fund, you can participate in its Dividend Reinvestment
Plan ("Plan"), a convenient, simple and efficient way to reinvest your dividends
and capital gains distributions, if any, in additional shares of the Fund. Below
is a short summary of how the Plan works.

Plan Summary

If you are a Plan participant who has not elected to receive your dividends in
the form of a cash payment, then your dividend and capital gain distributions
will be reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Fund.

The number of common stock shares in the Fund you will receive in lieu of a cash
dividend is determined in the following manner. If the market price of the
common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share ("NAV") on the
determination date, you will be issued shares by the Fund at a price reflecting
the NAV, or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.

If the market price is less than the NAV at the time of valuation (the close of
business on the determination date), PFPC Global Fund Services ("Plan Agent")
will buy common stock for your account in the open market.

If the Plan Agent begins to purchase additional shares in the open market and
the market price of the shares subsequently rises above the previously
determined NAV before the purchases are completed, the Plan Agent will attempt
to terminate purchases and have the Fund issue the remaining dividend or
distribution in shares at the greater of the previously determined NAV or 95% of
the market price. In that case, the number of Fund shares you receive will be
based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the open
market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares.

A more complete description of the current Plan appears in the section of this
report beginning on page 25. To find out more detailed information about the
Plan and about how you can participate, please call PFPC Global Fund Services at
(800) 331-1710.

Bond Ratings (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The definitions of the applicable rating symbols are set forth below:

Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("Standard & Poor's") -- Ratings from "AA" to
"CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign to show
relative standings within the major rating categories.

AAA        -- Bonds rated "AAA" have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
              Poor's. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely
              strong.
AA         -- Bonds rated "AA" have a very strong capacity to pay interest and
              repay principal and differs from the highest rated issue only in a
              small degree.
A          -- Bonds rated "A" have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
              principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
              effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than
              debt in higher rated categories.
BBB        -- Bonds rated "BBB" are regarded as having an adequate capacity to
              pay interest and repay principal. Whereas it normally exhibits
              adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or
              changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
              capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this
              category than in higher rated categories.
BB, B         Bonds rated "BB", "B", "CCC" and "CC" are regarded, on balance, as
CCC and CC -- predominantly speculative and with respect to capacity to pay
              interest and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the
              obligation. "BB" represents a lower degree of speculation than
              "B", and "CC" the highest degree of speculation. While such bonds
              will likely have some quality and protective characteristics,
              these are outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk
              exposures to adverse conditions.

Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") -- Numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 may be
applied to each generic rating from "Aa" to "Caa", where 1 is the highest and 3
the lowest rating within its generic category.

Aaa        -- Bonds rated "Aaa" are judged to be of the best quality. They carry
              the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred
              to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or
              by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While
              the various protective elements are likely to change, such changes
              as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally
              strong position of such issues.
Aa         -- Bonds rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all
              standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are
              generally known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the
              best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in
              Aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of
              greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which
              make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa
              securities.
A          -- Bonds rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes and
              are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors
              giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate
              but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to
              impairment some time in the future.
Baa        -- Bonds rated "Baa" are considered as medium grade obligations,
              i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.
              Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the
              present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
              characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such
              bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have
              speculative characteristics as well.
Ba         -- Bonds rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their
              future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection
              of interest and principal payments may be very moderate, and
              therefore not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over
              the future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this
              class.
B          -- Bonds rated "B" generally lack characteristics of the desirable
              investments. Assurance of interest and principal payments or
              maintenance of other terms of the contract over any long period of
              time may be small.
C          -- Bonds rated "C" are the lowest rated class of bonds, and issues so
              rated can be regarded as having extremely poor prospects of ever
              attaining any real investment standing.

Bond Ratings (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fitch Ratings ("Fitch") -- Ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the
addition of a plus (+) sign or minus (-) sign to show relative standings within
the major ratings categories.

AA         -- Bonds rated "AA" are considered to be investment-grade and of very
              high credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and/or
              dividends and repay principal is very strong.
A          -- Bonds and preferred stock considered to be investment-grade and of
              high credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and/or
              dividends and repay principal is considered to be strong, but may
              be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions and
              circumstances than debt or preferred securities with higher
              ratings.
BBB        -- Bonds rated "BBB" are considered to be investment-grade and of
              satisfactory credit quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest
              or dividends and repay principal is considered to be adequate.
              Adverse changes in economic conditions and circumstances, however,
              are more likely to have adverse impact on these securities and,
              therefore, impair timely payment. The likelihood that the ratings
              of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for
              securities with higher ratings.

NR         -- Indicates that the bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's or
              Moody's.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short-Term Security Ratings (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SP-1       -- Standard & Poor's highest rating indicating very strong or strong
              capacity to pay principal and interest; those issues determined to
              possess overwhelming safety characteristics are denoted with a
              plus (+) sign.

A-1        -- Standard & Poor's highest commercial paper and variable-rate
              demand obligation ("VRDO") rating indicating that the degree of
              safety regarding timely payment is either overwhelming or very
              strong; those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety
              characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign.

VMIG 1     -- Moody's highest rating for issues having a demand feature -- VRDO.

1. Significant Accounting Policies

The Intermediate Muni Fund, Inc. ("Fund"), a Maryland corporation, is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified,
closed-end management investment company.

The significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund are:(a)
security transactions are accounted for on trade date;(b) securities are valued
at the mean between the bid and asked prices provided by an independent pricing
service that are based on transactions in municipal obligations, quotations from
municipal bond dealers, market transactions in comparable securities and various
relationships between securities; (c) securities for which market quotations are
not available will be valued in good faith at fair market value by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors; (d) securities maturing within 60 days are
valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which
approximates value; (e) gains or losses on the sale of securities are calculated
by using the specific identification method; (f) interest income, adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discount, is recorded on an accrual
basis; (g) the Fund intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pertaining to regulated investment
companies and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it
from substantially all Federal income and excise taxes; (h) dividends and
distributions to shareholders are recorded monthly by the Fund on the
ex-dividend date for the shareholders of Common Stock based on net investment
income. The holders of the Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to receive dividends in accordance with an auction that will
normally be held weekly to shareholders of funds legally available to
shareholders; capital gains distributions, if any, are taxable to shareholders,
and are declared and paid at least annually; (i) the character of income and
gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations
which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; (j) the net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock is
determined by dividing the value of the net assets available to Common Stock by
the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. For the purpose of
determining the net asset value per share of the common stock, the value of the
Fund's net assets shall be deemed to equal the value of the Fund's assets less
(1) the Fund's liabilities, (2) the aggregate liquidation value (i.e., $25,000
per outstanding share) of the Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock
and (3) accumulated and unpaid dividends on the outstanding Municipal Auction
Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock issue; and (k) estimates and assumptions are
required to be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets
resulting from operations when financial statements are prepared. Changes in the
economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in
determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.

2. Exempt-Interest Dividends and Other Distributions

The Fund intends to satisfy conditions that will enable interest from municipal
securities, which is exempt from Federal income tax and from designated state
income taxes, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to the
shareholders of the Fund.

3. Management Agreement and Transactions with Affiliated Persons

Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("SBFM"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary
of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as investment manager to the Fund. As
compensation for its services, the Fund pays SBFM a fee calculated at the annual
rate of 0.60% of the Fund's average daily net assets. For purposes of
calculating the management fee, the liquidation value of any preferred stock of
the Fund is not deducted in determining the Fund's average daily net assets.
This fee is calculated daily and paid monthly.

All officers and one Director of the Fund are employees of Citigroup or its
affiliates.

4. Investments

During the six months ended June 30, 2003, the aggregate cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of long-term
investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

================================================================================
Purchases                                                            $15,270,556

================================================================================

At June 30, 2003, aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
investments for Federal income tax purposes were substantially as follows:

================================================================================
Gross unrealized appreciation                                      $ 13,238,153
Gross unrealized depreciation                                        (2,736,639)

5. Futures Contracts

Securities or cash equal to the initial margin amount are either deposited with
the broker or segregated by the custodian upon entering into the futures
contract. During the period the futures contract is open, changes in the value
of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or losses by "marking to
market" on a daily basis to reflect the market value of the contract at the end
of each day's trading. Variation margin payments are made or received and
recognized as assets due from or liabilities due to broker, depending upon
whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. When the contract is closed,
the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the

6. Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock

The underwriting discount of $500,000 and offering expenses of $278,731
associated with the Municipal Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock ("ARCPS")
offering were recorded as a reduction of the capital paid in excess of par value
of common stock. The ARCPS' dividends are cumulative at a rate determined at an
auction and the dividend period is typically 7 days. The dividend rates ranged
from 0.90%-1.30% for the six months ended June 30, 2003.

The ARCPS are redeemable under certain conditions by the Fund, or subject to
mandatory redemption (if the Fund is in default of certain coverage
requirements) at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share plus accumulated
and unpaid dividends. ARCPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share
plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverages with respect to the
ARCPS. If the Fund fails to maintain these coverages and does not cure any such
failure within the required time period, the Fund is required to redeem a
requisite number of the ARCPS in order to meet the applicable requirement.
Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing asset coverage requirements would
restrict the Fund's ability to pay dividends.

Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM"), formerly known as Salomon Smith Barney
Inc., another indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup also currently acts
as a broker/dealer in connection with the auction of ARCPS. After each auction,
the auction agent will pay to each broker/dealer, from monies the Fund provides
a participation fee at the annual rate of 0.25% of the purchase price of the
ARCPS that the broker/dealer places at the auction. For the six months ended
June 30, 2003, CGM earned $62,058 as the broker/dealer.

(1)   For the six months ended June 30, 2003 (unaudited).
(2)   Effective January 1, 2001, the Fund adopted a change in the accounting
      method that requires the Fund to amortize premiums and accrete all
      discounts. Without the adoption of this change, for the year ended
      December 31, 2001, the ratio of net investment income to average net
      assets would have been 5.31%. Per share information, ratios and
      supplemental data for the periods prior to January 1, 2001 have not been
      restated to reflect this change in presentation. In addition, the impact
      of this change to net investment income and net realized and unrealized
      gain per share was less than $0.01.

      accordance with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan (unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), a shareholder whose shares
of common stock are registered in his own name will have all distributions from
the fund reinvested automatically by PFPC Global Fund Services ("PFPC"), as
purchasing agent under the plan, unless the shareholder elects to receive cash.
Distributions with respect to shares registered in the name of a broker-dealer
or other nominee (that is, in street name) will be reinvested by the broker or
nominee in additional shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided
by the broker or nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in
cash. Investors who own common stock registered in street name should consult
their broker-dealers for details regarding reinvestment. All distributions to
shareholders who do not participate in the plan will be paid by check mailed
directly to the record holder by or under the direction of First Data as
dividend paying agent.

The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the plan in
lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. When the market
price of the common stock is equal to or exceeds the net asset value per share
of the common stock on the determination date (generally, the record date for
the distribution), Plan participants will be issued shares of common stock by
the fund at a price equal to the greater of net asset value determined as
described below under "Net Asset Value" or 95% of the market price of the common
stock.

If the market price of the common stock is less than the net asset value of the
common stock at the time of valuation (which is the close of business on the
determination date), PFPC will buy common stock in the open market, on the AMEX
or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. If following the commencement of
the purchases and before PFPC has completed its purchases, the market price
exceeds the net asset value of the common stock as of the valuation time, PFPC
will attempt to terminate purchases in the open market and cause the fund to
issue the remaining portion of the dividend or distribution in shares at a price
equal to the greater of (a) net asset value as of the valuation time or (b) 95%
of the then current market price. In this case, the number of shares received by
a Plan participant will be based on the weighted average of prices paid for
shares purchased in the open market and the price at which the fund issues the
remaining shares. To the extent PFPC is unable to stop open market purchases and
cause the Fund to issue the remaining shares, the average per share purchase
price paid by PFPC may exceed the net asset value of the common stock as of the
valuation time, resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the
dividend or capital gains distribution had been paid in

common stock issued by the Fund at such net asset value. PFPC will begin to
purchase common stock on the open market as soon as practicable after the
determination date for the dividend or capital gains distribution, but in no
event shall such purchases continue later than 30 days after the payment date
for such dividend or distribution, or the record date for a succeeding dividend
or distribution, except when necessary to comply with applicable provisions of
the federal securities laws.

PFPC maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmations of all transactions in each account, including information needed
by a shareholder for personal and tax records. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will not relieve plan participants of
any income tax that may be payable on the dividends or capital gains
distributions. Common stock in the account of each plan participant will be held
by PFPC in uncertificated form in the name of the plan participant.

Plan participants are subject to no charge for reinvesting dividends and capital
gains distributions under the Plan. PFPC's fees for handling the reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will be paid by the fund. No brokerage
charges apply with respect to shares of common stock issued directly by the fund
under the Plan. Each plan participant will, however, bear a proportionate share
of any brokerage commissions actually incurred with respect to any open market
purchases made under the plan.

Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes to it are desirable. The
Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the plan as applied to any
dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution. The plan also may be amended or
terminated by PFPC, with the fund's prior written consent, on at least 30 days'
written notice to plan participants. All correspondence concerning the plan
should be directed by mail to PFPC Global Fund Services, P.O. Box 8030, Boston,
Massachusetts 02266-8030 or by telephone at (800) 331-1710.
