PORTFOLIO MANAGERS' REPORT

Dear Shareholders:

ING Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust") is a diversified, closed-end investment
company that seeks to provide investors with as high a level of current income
as is consistent with the preservation of capital. The Trust seeks to achieve
this objective by investing in a professionally managed portfolio comprised
primarily of senior loans.

PEFORMANCE SUMMARY

The Trust declared $0.42 of dividends during the fiscal year ended February 29,
2004. Based on the average month-end net asset value ("NAV") per share of $7.17,
this resulted in an annualized distribution rate of 5.95%(1) for the year. The
Trust's total return for the fiscal year, based on NAV, was 15.72%, versus a
total return on the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index of 9.40% for the same period.
The total market value return (based on full reinvestment of dividends) for the
Trust's common shares during the fiscal year was 28.77%.

MARKET OVERVIEW

The non-investment grade loan market closed out the twelve-month period ended
February 29, 2004 in robust fashion, driven by bullish investor sentiment and
the continuation of several positive trends, both macroeconomic and specific to
credit markets. Although sustained job creation still appears elusive at this
point, revitalization of the U.S. economy has clearly taken hold, as evidenced
by above-consensus gross domestic product numbers during recent quarters, and
stronger than expected corporate earnings across many key industry sectors.
Importantly, an improved economic outlook played a significant role in the
effective re-opening of debt capital markets to a broader spectrum of
non-investment grade borrowers. At the corporate level, although top-line
revenue growth remains difficult to come by during this period of muted pricing
power and intense global competition, in general, corporate executives continue
to do the right things, I.E., lower production costs, improve productivity, and
address liquidity concerns via renewed access to capital. These factors, taken
as a whole, propelled the leveraged loan market to record returns during 2003
with continued momentum into the first quarter of 2004.

PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW

Against the backdrop of an increasingly strong loan market, we continued during
the fiscal year to emphasize industries and individual loan positions that we
believe offer value. Cable television and wireless communications finished out
the fiscal year as the Trust's two largest industry sectors, primarily on the
basis of offering attractive returns for the underlying risk. During the fiscal
year, several of the Trust's larger individual holdings from these two sectors
benefited from fundamental credit improvement. Specifically, Charter
Communications Operating, LLC reported several quarters in which it met or
exceeded analyst expectations, and in doing so, the third largest cable
television provider in the U.S. has effectively regained access to much needed
capital in order to address specific balance sheet issues. As a result, the
price of the company's term loans have returned to near-par levels. Charter's
resurgence also directly impacted, in a favorable manner, the loans of Adelphia
Communications and its subsidiaries, the country's fifth largest cable operator.
Although Adelphia continues to work through a very complex Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceeding, the market value of the company's debt obligations continues to
point to a full recovery to lenders upon exit from bankruptcy. We continue to
monitor this situation closely.

</Table>

Similarly, Nextel Communications ("Nextel"), the bellwether issuer in the
non-investment grade wireless sector, turned in a succession of very strong
quarters during the period under review and, during the Trust's fourth fiscal
quarter, refinanced it's sizeable credit facility at attractive borrowing rates.
We took this opportunity to reduce the Trust's overall exposure to Nextel. As in
the recent past, Nextel's operational strength and capital markets activity has
provided a catalyst to improved sentiment across the overall wireless sector,
historically one of the Trust's largest.

While we proactively manage the Trust's largest exposures, we continue to
maintain a high level of diversification of the portfolio, across both issuer
and industry lines. As of February 29, 2004, the average individual position
accounted for approximately 0.26% of the Trust's total assets, as compared to
roughly 0.35% as of February 29, 2003. The average amount invested per industry
was also reduced during the fiscal year, to approximately 2.47% of total assets,
from 2.73% at the end of the year-ended February 28, 2003.

USE OF LEVERAGE

The Trust utilizes financial leverage to seek to increase the yield to the
holders of common shares. As of February 29, 2004, the Trust had $450 million of
"Aaa/AAA(2)" rated cumulative auction rate preferred shares outstanding, and
$225 million of borrowings outstanding under $525 million in available credit
facilities. Total leverage, as a percentage of total assets (including preferred
shares), was 39.88% at year end. The use of leverage for investment purposes
increases both investment opportunity and investment risk.

OUTLOOK

As we move further into 2004, loan investors, when analyzing their options, will
seek to balance the prospects of an improving domestic economy with a
supply/demand picture still heavily in favor of loan issuers. On one hand, the
current environment has distinctly impacted existing loan prices in a favorable
manner. On the other, it has also ushered in a period of unprecedented spread
tightening, and made uncovering value a difficult proposition. While there is
likely little upside left in loan prices at this point, fortunately, absent any
significant external economic or geopolitical shocks, the downside also appears
limited, at least for the foreseeable future. Default levels continue to drift
lower, and a generational low in corporate borrowing rates, combined with
historically strong investor demand for higher-yielding investments, has enabled
many corporations to shore up balance sheets and thereby improve cash flow. Over
the next few months, all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve as it determines
when it is appropriate to increase short-term interest rates. Given the
ultra-short duration of floating rate loans, an upward move in short-term rates
would prove positive for the Trust's distributable yield.

We thank you for your investment in ING Prime Rate Trust.

April 4, 2004

(1)  The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing dividends declared
     during the quarter and dividing the resulting annualized dividend by the
     Trust's average month-end net asset value (In the case of NAV) or the
     average month-end NYSE Composite closing price (in the case of Market). The
     distribution rate is based solely on the actual dividends and
     distributions, which are made at the discretion of management. The
     distribution rate may or may not include all investment income and
     ordinarily will not include capital gains or losses, if any.

(2)  Obligations rated Aaa by Moody's Investors Service are judged to be of the
     highest quality, with minimal credit risk. An obligator rated `AAA' has
     extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments. `AAA' is the
     highest Issuer Credit Rating assigned by Standard & Poor's.

(A)  Yield is calculated by dividing the Trust's net investment income per share
     for the most recent thirty days by the net asset value (in the case of NAV)
     or the NYSE Composite closing price (in the case of market) at quarter-end.
     Yield calculations do not include any commissions or sales charges, and are
     compounded for six months and annualized for a twelve-month period to
     derive the Trust's yield consistent with the SEC standardized yield formula
     for open-end investment companies.

(B)  The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing each monthly dividend,
     then averaging the annualized dividends declared for each month during the
     quarter and dividing the resulting average annualized dividend amount by
     the Trust's average net asset value (in the case of NAV) or the NYSE
     Composite closing price (in the case of Market) at the end of the period.

INDEX DESCRIPTIONS

THE S&P/LSTA LEVERAGED LOAN INDEX ("LLI") is an unmanaged total return index
that captures accrued interest, repayments, and market value changes. It
represents a broad cross section of leveraged loans syndicated in the United
States, including dollar-denominated loans to overseas issuers. Standard &
Poor's and the Loan Syndications & Trading Association ("LSTA") conceived the
LLI to establish a performance benchmark for the syndicated leveraged loan
industry. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.

THE CREDIT SUISSE FIRST BOSTON LEVERAGED LOAN INDEX is an unmanaged index of
below-investment-grade loans designed to mirror the investable universe of the
U.S. dollar-denominated leveraged loan market. An investor cannot invest
directly in an index.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees
ING Prime Rate Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of the ING
Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust"), including the portfolio of investments, as of
February 29, 2004, the related statements of operations and cash flows for the
year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the years in
the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
years in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of February 29, 2004, by correspondence with the custodian
and other appropriate audit procedures. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of ING
Prime Rate Trust as of February 29, 2004, the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the years in the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the years in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS as of February 29, 2004

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

ING Prime Rate Trust (the "Trust"), a Massachusetts business trust, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
Act"), as a diversified, closed-end, investment management company. The Trust
invests in senior loans which are exempt from registration under the Securities
Act of 1933 as amended (the "33 Act"), but contain certain restrictions on
resale and cannot be sold publicly. These loans bear interest (unless otherwise
noted) at rates that float periodically at a margin above the Prime Rate of a
U.S. bank specified in the credit agreement, the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate
("LIBOR"), the certificate of deposit rate, or in some cases another base
lending rate. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial
statements. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
policies are in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America.

A.   SENIOR LOAN AND OTHER SECURITY VALUATION. Loans are normally valued at the
     mean of the means of one or more bid and asked quotations obtained from a
     pricing service or other sources determined by the Board of Trustees to be
     independent and believed to be reliable. Loans for which reliable market
     value quotations are not readily available may be valued with reference to
     another loan or a group of loans for which quotations are more readily
     available and whose characteristics are comparable to the loan being
     valued. Under this approach, the comparable loan or loans serve as a proxy
     for changes in value of the loan being valued. The Trust has engaged an
     independent pricing service to provide quotations from dealers in loans and
     to calculate values under the proxy procedure described above. As of
     February 29, 2004, 96.85% of total investments were valued based on these
     procedures. It is expected that most of the loans held by the Trust will be
     valued with reference to quotations from the independent pricing service or
     with reference to the proxy procedure described above.

     Prices from a pricing source may not be available for all loans and ING
     Investments, LLC (the "Investment Manager") or Aeltus Investment
     Management, Inc. ("ING Aeltus" the "Sub-Adviser"), may believe that the
     price for a loan derived from market quotations or the proxy procedure
     described above is not reliable or accurate. Among other reasons, this may
     be the result of information about a particular loan or borrower known to
     the Investment Manager that the Investment Manager believes may not be
     known to the pricing service or reflected in a price quote. In this event,
     the loan is valued at fair value as determined in good faith under
     procedures established by the Trust's Board of Trustees and in accordance
     with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Under these procedures, fair value is
     determined by the Investment Manager and monitored by the Trust's Board of
     Trustees through its Valuation and Proxy Committee. In fair valuing a loan,
     consideration is given to several factors, which may include, among others,
     the following: (i) the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data
     relating to the loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate,
     period until the next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate
     of the loan, the terms and conditions of the loan and any related
     agreements, and the position of the loan in the borrower's debt structure;
     (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the collateral, including the
     Trust's rights, remedies and interests with respect to the collateral;
     (iii) the creditworthiness of the borrower and the cash flow coverage of
     outstanding principal and interest, based on an evaluation of its financial
     condition, financial statements and information about the borrower's
     business, cash flows, capital structure and future prospects; (iv)
     information relating to the market for the loan, including price quotations
     for, and trading in, the loan and interests in similar loans; (v) the

                                       13
<Page>

     reputation and financial condition of the agent for the loan and any
     intermediate participants in the loan; (vi) the borrower's management; and
     (vii) the general economic and market conditions affecting the fair value
     of the loan. Securities for which the primary market is a national
     securities exchange are valued at the last reported sale price. Securities
     reported by NASDAQ will be valued at NASDAQ official closing price. Debt
     and equity securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed
     securities for which no sale was reported on that date are valued at the
     mean between the last reported bid and asked price. Securities other than
     senior loans for which reliable quotations are not readily available and
     all other assets will be valued at their respective fair values as
     determined in good faith by, and under procedures established by, the Board
     of Trustees of the Trust. Investments in securities maturing in less than
     60 days from the date of acquisition are valued at amortized cost.

B.   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. It is the Trust's policy to comply with subchapter M
     of the Internal Revenue Code and related excise tax provisions applicable
     to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially all of
     its net investment income and net realized capital gains to its
     shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. No
     capital gain distributions shall be made until any capital loss
     carryforwards have been fully utilized or expire.

C.   SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND REVENUE RECOGNITION. Loans are booked on a
     settlement date basis and security transactions are accounted for on trade
     date (date the order to buy or sell is executed). Realized gains or losses
     are reported on the basis of identified cost of securities sold. Dividend
     income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recorded
     on an accrual basis at the then-current interest rate of the loan. The
     accrual of interest on loans is discontinued when, in the opinion of
     management, there is an indication that the borrower may be unable to meet
     payments as they become due. Upon such discontinuance, all unpaid accrued
     interest is reversed. Cash collections on nonaccrual senior loans are
     generally applied as a reduction to the recorded investment of the loan.
     Senior loans are returned to accrual status only after all past due amounts
     have been received. For all loans acquired prior to March 1, 2001,
     arrangement fees received, which represent non-refundable fees associated
     with the acquisition of loans are deferred and recognized over the shorter
     of 2.5 years or the actual terms of the loan. For all loans, except
     revolving credit facilities, acquired subsequent to February 28, 2001, fees
     received are treated as discounts and accreted as described in Note 2.H.
     Fees associated with revolving credit facilities acquired subsequent to
     February 28, 2001 are deferred and recognized over the shorter of four
     years or the actual term of the loan.

D.   DISTRIBUTIONS TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. The Trust declares dividends monthly
     for net investment income. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are
     declared and paid annually. The Trust may make additional distributions to
     comply with the distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. The
     character and amounts of income and gains to be distributed are determined
     in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from
     accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
     for investment companies. Dividends paid by the Trust from net investment
     income and distributions of net realized short-term capital gains are, for
     federal income tax purposes, taxable as ordinary income to shareholders.
     The Trust records distributions to its shareholders on the ex-dividend
     date.

E.   DIVIDEND REINVESTMENTS. Pursuant to the Shareholder Investment Program
     (formerly known as the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan), DST Systems,
     Inc., the Plan Agent, purchases, from time to time, shares of beneficial
     interest of the Trust on the open market to satisfy dividend reinvestments.
     Such shares are purchased only when the closing sale or bid price plus
     commission is less than the net asset value per share of the stock on the
     valuation date. If the

                                       14
<Page>

     market price plus commissions is equal to or exceeds the net asset value,
     new shares are issued at the greater of (i) net asset value or (ii) the
     market price of the shares during the pricing period, minus a discount of
     5%.

F.   USE OF ESTIMATES. Management of the Trust has made certain estimates and
     assumptions relating to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues,
     expenses and contingencies to prepare these financial statements in
     conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
     States of America. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

G.   SHARE OFFERINGS. During the year ended February 28, 1999, the Trust began
     issuing shares under various shelf registration statements, whereby the net
     proceeds received by the Trust from share sales may not be less than the
     greater of (i) the NAV per share or (ii) 94% of the average daily market
     price over the relevant pricing period.

H.   CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE. In November 2000 the American Institute of
     Certified Public Accountants (the "AICPA") issued a revised version of the
     AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies (the "Guide").
     Effective March 1, 2001, the Fund adopted the provisions of the Guide and
     began amortizing premiums and accreting discounts on debt securities. Prior
     to March 1, 2001, the Trust had not amortized premiums nor accreted
     discounts. The cumulative effect of this accounting change had no impact on
     net assets of the Trust, but resulted in a $3,653,000 increase in the cost
     of securities and a corresponding $3,653,000 increase in net unrealized
     depreciation of investments, based on securities held by the Trust on March
     1, 2001.

NOTE 3 -- INVESTMENTS

For the year ended February 29, 2004, the cost of purchases and the proceeds
from principal repayment and sales of investments, excluding short-term notes,
totaled $1,411,276,175 and $1,354,283,285, respectively. At February 29, 2004,
the Trust held senior loans valued at $1,632,623,334 representing 97.1% of its
total investments. The market value of these assets is established as set forth
in Note 2.

The senior loans acquired by the Trust may take the form of a direct lending
relationship with the borrower, or an assignment of a lender's interest in a
loan. The lead lender in a typical corporate loan syndicate administers the loan
and monitors collateral. In the event that the lead lender becomes insolvent,
enters FDIC receivership or, if not FDIC insured, enters into bankruptcy, the
Trust may incur certain costs and delays in realizing payment, or may suffer a
loss of principal and/or interest.

Common and preferred shares, and stock purchase warrants held in the portfolio
were acquired in conjunction with loans held by the Trust. Certain of these
stocks and warrants are restricted and may not be publicly sold without

NOTE 6 -- COMMITMENTS

The Trust has entered into both a $90 million 364-day revolving credit agreement
which matures on August 25, 2004 and a $435 million 364-day revolving
securitization facility which matures on June 13, 2004, collateralized by assets
of the Trust. Borrowing rates under these agreements are based on a fixed spread
over LIBOR, the federal funds rate, or a commercial paper-based rate. Prepaid
arrangement fees for these facilities are amortized over the term of the
agreements. The amount of borrowings outstanding at February 29, 2004, was $225
million. Weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 1.49%,
excluding fees related to the unused portion of the facilities, and other fees.
The amount of borrowings represented 13.21% of total assets at February 29,
2004. Average borrowings for the year ended February 29, 2004 were $143,193,989

</Table>

On November 2, 2000, the Trust issued 3,600 shares each of Series M, Series W
and Series F Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Shares, $.01 Par Value, $25,000
liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $270 million. Also, on November
16, 2000, the Trust issued 3,600 shares of Series T and Series Th Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Shares, $.01 Par Value, $25,000, liquidation preference,
for a total issuance of $180 million. Costs associated with the offering of
approximately $5,438,664 were charged against the proceeds received. The Trust
used the net proceeds of the offering to partially pay down the then existing
indebtedness. The Trust may reborrow amounts in the future to increase its use
of leverage which will be consistent with the limitations imposed by the 1940
Act. Preferred Shares pay dividends based on a rate set at auctions, normally
held every 7 days. In most instances dividends are also payable every 7 days, on
the first business day following the end of the rate period.

NOTE 8 -- CUSTODIAL AGREEMENT

State Street Bank and Trust Company ("SSB") serves as the Trust's custodian and
recordkeeper. Custody fees paid to SSB are reduced by earnings credits based on
the cash balances held by SSB for the Trust. There were no earnings credits for
the year ended February 29, 2004.

NOTE 9 -- SUBORDINATED LOANS AND UNSECURED LOANS

The primary risk arising from investing in subordinated loans or in unsecured
loans is the potential loss in the event of default by the issuer of the loans.
The Trust may acquire a subordinated loan only if, at the time of acquisition,
it acquires or holds a Senior Loan from the same borrower. The Trust will
acquire unsecured loans only where the Investment Manager believes, at the time
of acquisition, that the Trust would have the right to payment upon default that
is not subordinate to any other creditor. The Trust may invest up to 5% of its
total assets, measured at the time of investment, in subordinated loans and
unsecured loans. As of February 29, 2004, the Trust held 0.79% of its total
assets in subordinated loans and unsecured loans.

NOTE 10 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The amount of distributions from net investment income and net realized capital
gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which
may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America for investment companies. These book/tax differences may be either
temporary or permanent. Permanent differences are reclassified within the
capital accounts based on their federal tax-basis treatment; temporary
differences are not reclassified. Key differences include the treatment of
short-term capital gains and wash sale deferrals. Distributions in excess of net
investment income and/or net realized capital gains for tax purposes are
reported as distributions of paid-in capital.

The following permanent tax differences have been reclassified as of February
29, 2004:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION (Unaudited)

SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENT PROGRAM

The Trust offers a Shareholder Investment Program (the "Program," formerly known
as the Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan) which allows holders of the
Trust's common shares a simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gains
distributions, if any, in additional common shares of the Trust. The Program
also offers holders of the Trust's common shares the ability to make optional
cash investments in any amount from $100 to $25,000 on a monthly basis. Amounts
in excess of $25,000 require prior approval of the Trust. DST Systems, Inc., the
Trust's Transfer Agent, is the administrator for the Program.

For dividend reinvestment purposes, DST Systems, Inc. will purchase shares of
the Trust on the open market when the market price plus estimated commissions is
less than the net asset value on the valuation date. The Trust may issue new
shares when the market price plus estimated commissions is equal to or exceeds
the net asset value on the valuation date. New shares may be issued at the
greater of (i) net asset value or (ii) the market price of the shares during the
pricing period, minus a discount of 5%.

For optional cash investments, shares will be purchased on the open market by
the DST Systems, Inc. when the market price plus estimated commissions is less
than the net asset value on the valuation date. New shares may be issued by the
Trust when the market price plus estimated commissions is equal to or exceeds
the net asset value on the valuation date.

There is no charge to participate in the Program. Participants may elect to
discontinue participation in the Program at any time. Participants will share,
on a pro-rata basis, in the fees or expenses of any shares acquired in the open
market.

Participation in the Program is not automatic. If you would like to receive more
information about the Program or if you desire to participate, please contact
your broker or our Shareholder Services Department at (800) 992-0180.

Of the ordinary distributions made during the fiscal year ended February 29,
2004, 0.35% qualifies for the dividends received deduction to corporate
shareholders.

For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004, 0.35% of ordinary dividends paid by
the Trust are designated as qualifying dividend income subject to reduced income
tax rates for individuals.

The above figures may differ from those cited elsewhere in this report due to
differences in the calculation of income and gains under accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (book) and Internal Revenue
Service (tax) purposes.

Shareholders are strongly advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect
to the tax consequences of their investments in the Trust. In January 2004,
shareholders, excluding corporate shareholders, received an IRS 1099-DIV
regarding the federal tax status of the dividends and distributions received by
them in calendar year 2003.

(e) (1)   AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

                       MODEL AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
                               PRE-APPROVAL POLICY

     I. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

     Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Act"), the Audit Committee of
     the Board of Directors or Trustees (the "Committee") of the ING Funds (each
     a "Fund," collectively, the "Funds") set out under Paragraph I on EXHIBIT A

<Page>

     to this Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy ("Policy") is
     responsible for the oversight of the work of the Funds' independent
     auditors. As part of its responsibilities, the Committee must pre-approve
     the audit and non-audit services performed by the auditors in order to
     assure that the provision of these services does not impair the auditors'
     independence from the Funds. The Committee has adopted, and the Board has
     ratified, this Policy, which sets out the procedures and conditions under
     which the services of the independent auditors may be pre-approved.

     Under Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules promulgated in
     accordance with the Act, the Funds' may establish two different approaches
     to pre-approving audit and non-audit services. The Committee may approve
     services without consideration of specific case-by-case services ("general
     pre-approval") or it may pre-approve specific services ("specific
     pre-approval"). The Committee believes that the combination of these
     approaches contemplated in this Policy results in an effective and
     efficient method for pre-approving audit and non-audit services to be
     performed by the Funds' independent auditors. Under this Policy, services
     that are not of a type that may receive general pre-approval require
     specific pre-approval by the Committee. Any proposed services that exceed
     pre-approved cost levels or budgeted amounts will also require the
     Committee's specific pre-approval.

     For both types of approval, the Committee considers whether the subject
     services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence and
     that such services are compatible with maintaining the auditors
     independence. The Committee also considers whether a particular audit firm
     is in the best position to provide effective and efficient services to the
     Funds. Reasons that the auditors are in the best position include the
     auditors' familiarity with the Funds' business, personnel, culture,
     accounting systems, risk profile, and other factors, and whether the
     services will enhance the Funds' ability to manage and control risk or
     improve audit quality. Such factors will be considered as a whole, with no
     one factor being determinative.

     The appendices attached to this Policy describe the audit, audit-related,
     tax-related, and other services that have the Committee's general
     pre-approval. For any service that has been approved through general
     pre-approval, the general pre-approval will remain in place for a period 12
     months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Committee determines that
     a different period is appropriate. The Committee will annually review and
     pre-approve the services that may be provided by the independent auditors
     without specific pre-approval. The Committee will revise the list of
     services subject to general pre-approval as appropriate. This Policy does
     not serve as a delegation to Fund management of the Committee's duty to
     pre-approve services performed by the Funds' independent auditors.

     II. AUDIT SERVICES

     The annual audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to the
     Committee's specific pre-approval. Audit services are those services that
     are normally provided by auditors in connection with statutory and
     regulatory filings or engagements or those that generally only independent
     auditors can reasonably provide. They include the Funds' annual financial
     statement audit and procedures that the independent auditors must perform
     in order to form an opinion on the Funds' financial statements (E.G.,
     information systems and procedural reviews and testing). The Committee will
     monitor the audit services engagement and approve any changes in terms,
     conditions or fees deemed by the Committee to be necessary or appropriate.

     The Committee may grant general pre-approval to other audit services, such
     as statutory audits and services associated with SEC registration
     statements, periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or
     issued in connection with securities offerings.

     The Committee has pre-approved the audit services listed on Appendix A. The
     Committee must specifically approve all audit services not listed on
     Appendix A.

     III. AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES

     Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are
     reasonably related to the performance of the audit or the review of the
     Funds' financial statements or are traditionally performed by the
     independent auditors. The Committee believes that the provision of
     audit-related services will not impair the independent auditors'
     independence, and therefore may grant pre-approval to audit-related
     services. Audit-related services include accounting consultations related
     to accounting, financial reporting or disclosure matters not classified as
     "audit services;" assistance with

<Page>

     understanding and implementing new accounting and financial reporting
     guidance from rulemaking authorities; agreed-upon or expanded audit
     procedures relating to accounting and/or billing records required to
     respond to or comply with financial, accounting or regulatory reporting
     matters; and assistance with internal control reporting requirements under
     Form N-SAR or Form N-CSR.

     The Committee has pre-approved the audit-related services listed on
     Appendix B. The Committee must specifically approve all audit-related
     services not listed on Appendix B.

     IV. TAX SERVICES

     The Committee believes the independent auditors can provide tax services to
     the Funds, including tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice, without
     compromising the auditors' independence. Therefore, the Committee may grant
     general pre-approval with respect to tax services historically provided by
     the Funds' independent auditors that do not, in the Committee's view,
     impair auditor independence and that are consistent with the SEC's rules on
     auditor independence.

     The Committee will not grant pre-approval if the independent auditors
     initially recommends a transaction the sole business purpose of which is
     tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be supported in the
     Internal Revenue Code and related regulations. The Committee may consult
     outside counsel to determine that tax planning and reporting positions are
     consistent with this Policy.

     The Committee has pre-approved the tax-related services listed on Appendix
     C. The Committee must specifically approve all tax-related services not
     listed on Appendix C.

     V. OTHER SERVICES

     The Committee believes it may grant approval of non-audit services that are
     permissible services for independent auditors to a Fund. The Committee has
     determined to grant general pre-approval to other services that it believes
     are routine and recurring, do not impair auditor independence, and are
     consistent with SEC rules on auditor independence.

     The Committee has pre-approved the non-audit services listed on Appendix D.
     The Committee must specifically approve all non-audit services not listed
     on Appendix D.

     A list of the SEC's prohibited non-audit services is attached to this
     Policy as Appendix E. The SEC's rules and relevant guidance should be
     consulted to determine the precise definitions of these impermissible
     services and the applicability of exceptions to certain of the SEC's
     prohibitions.

     VI. PRE-APPROVAL OF FEE LEVELS AND BUDGETED AMOUNTS

     The Committee will annually establish pre-approval fee levels or budgeted
     amounts for audit, audit-related, tax and non-audit services to be provided
     to the Funds by the independent auditors. Any proposed services exceeding
     these levels or amounts require the Committee's specific pre-approval. The
     Committee considers fees for audit and non-audit services when deciding
     whether to pre-approve services. The Committee may determine, for a
     pre-approval period of 12 months, the appropriate ratio between the total
     amount of fees for the Fund's audit, audit-related, and tax services
     (including fees for services provided to Fund affiliates that are subject
     to pre-approval), and the total amount of fees for certain permissible
     non-audit services for the Fund classified as other services (including any
     such services provided to Fund affiliates that are subject to
     pre-approval).

     VII. PROCEDURES

     Requests or applications for services to be provided by the independent
     auditors will be submitted to management. If management determines that the
     services do not fall within those services generally pre-approved by the
     Committee and set out in the appendices to these procedures, management
     will submit the services to the Committee or its delagee.

<Page>

     Any such submission will include a detailed description of the services to
     be rendered. Notwithstanding this paragraph, the Committee will, on an
     annual basis, receive from the independent auditors a list of services
     provided by the auditors during the prior 12-month period.

     VIII. DELEGATION

     The Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of the
     Committee's members. Any member or members to whom such pre-approval
     authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions, including
     any pre-approved services, to the Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
     The Committee will identify any member to whom pre-approval authority is
     delegated in writing. The member will retain such authority for a period of
     12 months from the date of pre-approval unless the Committee determines
     that a different period is appropriate. The period of delegated authority
     may be terminated by the Committee or at the option of the member.

     IX. ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

     The Committee will take any measures the Committee deems necessary or
     appropriate to oversee the work of the independent auditors and to assure
     the auditors' independence from the Funds. This may include reviewing a
     formal written statement from the independent auditors delineating all
     relationships between the auditors and the Funds, consistent with
     Independence Standards Board No. 1, and discussing with the auditors their
     methods and procedures for ensuring independence.

                                    ING FUNDS

                     PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES
                          Effective as of July 10, 2003
                As amended August 21, 2003 and November 11, 2003

I.        INTRODUCTION

The following are the Proxy Voting Procedures and Guidelines (the "Procedures
and Guidelines") of the ING Funds set forth on Exhibit 1 attached hereto and
each portfolio or series thereof (each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds").
The purpose of these Procedures and Guidelines is to set forth the process by
which each Fund will vote proxies related to the assets in its investment
portfolio (the "portfolio securities"). The Procedures and Guidelines have been
approved by each of the Funds' Board of Trustees/Directors(1) (each a "Board"
and collectively, the "Boards"), including a majority of the independent
Trustees/Directors(2) of the Board. These Procedures and Guidelines may be
amended only by the Board. The Board shall review these Procedures and
Guidelines at its discretion, and make any revisions thereto as deemed
appropriate by the Board.

II.       VALUATION AND PROXY VOTING COMMITTEE

The Boards hereby delegate to the Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee of each
Board (each a "Committee" and collectively, the "Committees") the authority and
responsibility to oversee the implementation of these Procedures and Guidelines,
and where applicable, to make determinations

- ----------
(1) Reference in these Procedures to one or more Funds shall, as applicable,
mean those Funds that are under the jurisdiction of the particular Board or
Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee at issue. No provision in these Procedures
is intended to impose any duty upon the particular Board or Valuation and Proxy
Voting Committee with respect to any other Fund.

(2) The independent Trustees/Directors are those Board members who are not
"interested persons" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) the Investment
Company Act of 1940.

<Page>

on behalf of the Board with respect to the voting of proxies on behalf of each
Fund. Furthermore, the Boards hereby delegate to each Committee the authority to
review and approve material changes to proxy voting procedures of any Fund's
investment adviser (the "Adviser"). The Proxy Voting Procedures of the Adviser
are attached hereto as Exhibit 2. Any determination regarding the voting of
proxies of each Fund that is made by a Committee, or any member thereof, as
permitted herein, shall be deemed to be a good faith determination regarding the
voting of proxies by the full Board. Each Committee may rely on the Adviser
through the Agent, Proxy Coordinator and/or Proxy Group (as such terms are
defined below and in the Adviser's proxy voting procedures) to deal in the first
instance with the application of these Procedures and Guidelines. Each Committee
shall conduct itself in accordance with its charter.

III.      DELEGATION OF VOTING RESPONSIBILITY

The Board hereby delegates to the Adviser to each Fund the authority and
responsibility to vote all proxies with respect to all portfolio securities of
each Fund in accordance with then current proxy voting procedures and guidelines
that have been approved by the Board. The Board may revoke such delegation with
respect to any proxy or proposal, and assume the responsibility of voting any
Fund proxy or proxies as it deems appropriate. Non-material amendments to the
Procedures and Guidelines may be approved for immediate implementation by the
President or Chief Financial Officer of a Fund, subject to ratification at the
next regularly scheduled meeting of the Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee.

When a Fund participates in the lending of its securities and the securities are
on loan at record date, proxies related to such securities will not be forwarded
to the Adviser by the Fund's custodian and therefore will not be voted.

When a Fund is a feeder in a master/feeder structure, proxies for the portfolio
securities of the master fund will be voted pursuant to the master fund's proxy
voting policies and procedures.

IV.       APPROVAL AND REVIEW OF PROCEDURES

Each Fund's Adviser has adopted proxy voting procedures in connection with the
voting of portfolio securities for the Funds as attached hereto in Exhibit 2.
The Board hereby approves such procedures. All material changes to such
procedures must be approved by the Board or the Valuation and Proxy Voting
Committee prior to implementation; however, the President or Chief Financial
Officer of a Fund may make such non-material changes as they deem appropriate,
subject to ratification by the Board or the Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee
at its next regularly scheduled meeting.

V.        VOTING PROCEDURES AND GUIDELINES

The Guidelines which are set forth in Exhibit 3 hereto specify the manner in
which the Funds generally will vote with respect to the proposals discussed
therein.

                                 ROUTINE MATTERS

          The Agent shall be instructed to submit a vote in accordance with the
          Guidelines where such Guidelines provide a clear "For", "Against" or
          "Abstain" on a proposal. However, the Agent shall be directed to refer
          proxy proposals to the Proxy Coordinator for instructions as

<Page>

          if it were a matter requiring case-by-case consideration under
          circumstances where the application of the Guidelines is unclear, they
          appear to involve unusual or controversial issues, or an Investment
          Professional recommends a vote contrary to the Guidelines.

          B.   Matters Requiring Case-by-Case Consideration

          The Agent shall be directed to refer proxy proposals accompanied by
          its written analysis and voting recommendation to the Proxy
          Coordinator where the Guidelines have noted a "case-by-case"
          consideration.

          Upon receipt of a referral from the Agent, the Proxy Coordinator may
          solicit additional research from the Agent, Investment
          Professional(s), as well as from any other source or service.

          The Proxy Coordinator will forward the Agent's analysis and
          recommendation and/or any research obtained from the Investment
          Professional(s), the Agent or any other source to the Proxy Group. The
          Proxy Group may consult with the Agent and/or Investment
          Professional(s), as it deems necessary.

               1.   Votes in Accordance with Agent Recommendation

               In the event the Proxy Group recommends a vote in accordance with
               the Agent's recommendation, the Proxy Group will instruct the
               Agent, through the Proxy Coordinator, to vote in accordance with
               the Agent's recommendation.

               2.   Non-Votes

               The Proxy Group may recommend that a Fund refrain from voting
               under the following circumstances: (1) if the economic effect on
               shareholders' interests or the value of the portfolio holding is
               indeterminable or insignificant or (2) if the cost of voting a
               proxy outweighs the benefits, E.G., certain international
               proxies. In such instances, the Proxy Group may instruct the
               Agent, through the Proxy Coordinator, not to vote such proxy.

               3.   Votes Contrary to Procedures and Guidelines, or Agent
                    Recommendation, where applicable, or Where No Recommendation
                    is Provided by Agent.

               If the Proxy Group recommends that a Fund vote contrary to the
               Procedures and Guidelines, or the recommendation of the Agent,
               where applicable, or if the Agent has made no recommendation and
               the Procedures and Guidelines are silent, the Proxy Coordinator
               will then request that each member of the Proxy Group and each
               Investment Professional participating in the voting process
               provide a Conflicts Report (as such term is defined for purposes
               of the Adviser's proxy voting procedures).

               If Counsel determines that a conflict of interest appears to
               exist with respect to any member of the Proxy Group or the
               relevant Investment Professional(s), the Proxy Coordinator will
               then call a meeting of the Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee
               and forward to such committee all information relevant to their
               review, including the

<Page>

               following materials or a summary thereof: the applicable
               Procedures and Guidelines, the recommendation of the Agent where
               applicable, the recommendation of the Investment Professional(s),
               where applicable, any resources used by the Proxy Group in
               arriving at its recommendation, the Conflicts Report and any
               other written materials establishing whether a conflict of
               interest exists, and findings of Counsel (as such term is defined
               for purposes of the Adviser's proxy voting procedures).

               If Counsel determines that there does not appear to be a conflict
               of interest with respect to any member of the Proxy Group or the
               relevant Investment Professional(s), the Proxy Coordinator will
               instruct the Agent to vote the proxy as recommended by the Proxy
               Group.

               4.   Referrals to a Fund's Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee

               A Fund's Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee may consider all
               recommendations, analysis, research and Conflicts Reports
               provided to it by the Agent, Proxy Group and/or Investment
               Professional(s), and any other written materials used to
               establish whether a conflict of interest exists, in determining
               how to vote the proxies referred to the Committee. The Committee
               will instruct the Agent through the Proxy Coordinator how to vote
               such referred proposals.

               The Proxy Coordinator will maintain a record of all proxy
               questions that have been referred to a Fund's Valuation and Proxy
               Voting Committee, all applicable recommendations, analysis,
               research and Conflicts Reports.

VI.       CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In all cases in which a vote has not been clearly determined in advance by the
Procedures and Guidelines or for which the Proxy Group recommends a vote
contrary to the Procedures and Guidelines, or contrary to the recommendation of
the Agent, or where the Procedures and Guidelines are silent and the Agent has
made no recommendation, and Counsel has determined that a conflict of interest
appears to exist with respect to any member of the Proxy Group or any Investment
Professional participating in the voting process, the proposal shall be referred
to the Fund's Valuation and Proxy Voting Committee for determination so that the
Adviser shall have no opportunity to vote a Fund's proxy in a situation in which
it may be deemed to have a conflict of interest.

VII.      REPORTING AND RECORD RETENTION

Beginning in August 2004, on an annual basis, each Fund will post its proxy
voting record or a link thereto for the prior one-year period ending on June
30th on the ING Funds website. The proxy voting record posted for any Fund that
is a feeder in a master/feeder structure will be that of the master fund. The
proxy voting record for each Fund will also be available in the EDGAR database
on the SEC's website.

                             PROXY VOTING PROCEDURES
                    Effective as of July 10, 2003, as amended


I.        INTRODUCTION

ING Investments, LLC, Directed Services, Inc. and ING Life Insurance and Annuity
          Company (each an "Adviser" and collectively, the "Advisers") are the
          investment advisers for the registered investment companies and each
          series or portfolio thereof (each a "Fund" and collectively, the
          "Funds") comprising the ING family of funds. As such, the Advisers
          have been delegated the authority to vote proxies with respect to
          securities for the Funds over which they have day-to-day portfolio
          management responsibility.

The Advisers will abide by the proxy voting guidelines adopted by a Fund's
          respective Board of Directors or Trustees (each a "Board" and
          collectively, the "Boards") with regard to the voting of proxies
          unless otherwise provided in the proxy voting procedures adopted by a
          Fund's Board.

In voting proxies, the Advisers are guided by general fiduciary principles. Each
must act prudently, solely in the interest of the beneficial owners of the Funds
it manages. The Advisers will not subordinate the interest of beneficial owners
to unrelated objectives. Each Adviser will vote proxies in the manner that it
believes will do the most to maximize shareholder value.

The following are the Proxy Voting Procedures of ING Investments, LLC, Directed
Services, Inc. and ING Life Insurance and Annuity Company with respect to the
voting of proxies on behalf of their client Funds as approved by the respective
Board of each Fund.

Unless otherwise noted, proxies will be voted in all instances.

II.       ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

          A.   Proxy Coordinator

          The Proxy Coordinator identified in Appendix 1 will assist in the
          coordination of the voting of each Fund's proxies in accordance with
          the ING Funds Proxy Voting Procedures and Guidelines ("Procedures and
          Guidelines"). The Proxy Coordinator is authorized to direct

<Page>

          the Agent to vote a Fund's proxy in accordance with the Procedures and
          Guidelines unless the Proxy Coordinator receives a recommendation from
          an Investment Professional (as described below) to vote contrary to
          the Procedures and Guidelines. In such event, the Proxy Coordinator
          will call a meeting of the Proxy Group.

          B.   Agent

          An independent proxy voting service (the "Agent"), as approved by the
          Board of each Fund, shall be engaged to assist in the voting of Fund
          proxies through the provision of vote analysis, implementation,
          recordkeeping and disclosure services. The Agent is responsible for
          coordinating with the Funds' custodians to ensure that all proxy
          materials received by the custodians relating to the portfolio
          securities are processed in a timely fashion. To the extent
          applicable, the Agent is required to vote and/or refer all proxies in
          accordance with these Procedures. The Agent will retain a record of
          all proxy votes handled by the Agent. Such record must reflect all the
          information required to be disclosed in a Fund's Form N-PX pursuant to
          Rule 30b1-4 under the Investment Company Act. In addition, the Agent
          is responsible for maintaining copies of all proxy statements received
          by issuers and to promptly provide such materials to the Adviser upon
          request.

          The Agent shall be instructed to vote all proxies in accordance with
          the ING Funds' Guidelines, except as otherwise instructed through the
          Proxy Coordinator by the Adviser's Proxy Group, or a Fund's Valuation
          and Proxy Voting Committee.

          The Agent shall be instructed to obtain all proxies from the Funds'
          custodians and to review each proxy proposal against the Guidelines.
          The Agent also shall be requested to call the Proxy Coordinator's
          attention to specific proxy proposals that although governed by the
          Guidelines appear to involve unusual or controversial issues.

          C.   Proxy Group

          The Adviser shall establish a Proxy Group (the "Proxy Group") which
          shall assist in the review of the Agent's recommendations when a proxy
          voting issue is referred to the Group through the Proxy Coordinator.
          The members of the Proxy Group, which may include employees of the
          Advisers' affiliates, are identified in Appendix 1, as may be amended
          from time at the Advisers' discretion.

          A minimum of four (4) members of the Proxy Group (or three (3) if one
          member of the quorum is either the Fund's Chief Investment Risk
          Officer or Chief Financial Officer) shall constitute a quorum for
          purposes of taking action at any meeting of the Group. The vote of a
          simple majority of the members present and voting shall determine any
          matter submitted to a vote. The Proxy Group may meet in person or by
          telephone. The Proxy Group also may take action via electronic mail in
          lieu of a meeting, provided that each Group member has received a copy
          of any relevant electronic mail transmissions circulated by each other
          participating Group member prior to voting and provided that the Proxy
          Coordinator follows the directions of a majority of a quorum (as
          defined above) responding via electronic mail. For all votes taken in
          person or by telephone or teleconference, the vote shall be taken
          outside the presence of any person other than the members of the Proxy
          Group.

<Page>

          A meeting of the Proxy Group will be held whenever the Proxy
          Coordinator receives a recommendation from an Investment Professional
          to vote a Fund's proxy contrary to the Procedures and Guidelines, or
          the recommendation of the Agent, where applicable, or if the Agent has
          made no recommendation with respect to a vote on a proposal.

          For each proposal referred to the Proxy Group, it will review (1) the
          Procedures and Guidelines, (2) the recommendation of the Agent, if
          any, (3) the recommendation of the Investment Professional(s) and (4)
          any other resources that the Proxy Group deems appropriate to aid in a
          determination of a recommendation.

          If the Proxy Group recommends that a Fund vote in accordance with the
          Procedures and Guidelines, or the recommendation of the Agent, where
          applicable, it shall instruct the Proxy Coordinator to so advise the
          Agent.

          If the Proxy Group recommends that a Fund vote contrary to the
          Procedures and Guidelines, or the recommendation of the Agent, where
          applicable, it shall follow the procedures for such voting as
          established by a Fund's Board.

          D.   Investment Professionals

          The Funds' Advisers, sub-advisers and/or portfolio managers (referred
          to herein as "Investment Professionals") may be asked to submit a
          recommendation to the Proxy Group regarding the voting of proxies
          related to the portfolio securities over which they have day-to-day
          portfolio management responsibility. The Investment Professionals may
          accompany their recommendation with any other research materials that
          they deem appropriate.

III.      VOTING PROCEDURES

          A.   In all cases, the Adviser shall follow the voting procedures as
               set forth in the Procedures and Guidelines of the Fund on whose
               behalf the Adviser is exercising delegated authority to vote.

                                 ROUTINE MATTERS

          The Agent shall be instructed to submit a vote in accordance with the
          Guidelines where such Guidelines provide a clear "For", "Against" or
          "Abstain" on a proposal. However, the Agent shall be directed to refer
          proxy proposals to the Proxy Coordinator for instructions as if it
          were a matter requiring case-by-case consideration under circumstances
          where the application of the Guidelines is unclear.

          C.   Matters Requiring Case-by-Case Consideration

          The Agent shall be directed to refer proxy proposals accompanied by
          its written analysis and voting recommendation to the Proxy
          Coordinator where the Guidelines have noted a "case-by-case"
          consideration.

          Upon receipt of a referral from the Agent, the Proxy Coordinator may
          solicit additional research from the Agent, Investment
          Professional(s), as well as from any other source or service.

<Page>

          The Proxy Coordinator will forward the Agent's analysis and
          recommendation and/or any research obtained from the Investment
          Professional(s), the Agent or any other source to the Proxy Group. The
          Proxy Group may consult with the Agent and/or Investment
          Professional(s), as it deems necessary.

               1.   Votes in Accordance with Agent Recommendation

               In the event the Proxy Group recommends a vote in accordance with
               the Agent's recommendation, the Proxy Group will instruct the
               Agent, through the Proxy Coordinator, to vote in accordance with
               the Agent's recommendation.

               2.   Non-Votes

               The Proxy Group may recommend that a Fund refrain from voting
               under the following circumstances: (1) if the economic effect on
               shareholders' interests or the value of the portfolio holding is
               indeterminable or insignificant or (2) if the cost of voting a
               proxy outweighs the benefits, E.G., certain international
               proxies. In such instances, the Proxy Group may instruct the
               Agent, through the Proxy Coordinator, not to vote such proxy.

               3.   Votes Contrary to Procedures and Guidelines, or Agent
                    Recommendation, where applicable, or Where No Recommendation
                    is Provided by Agent.

               If the Proxy Group recommends that a Fund vote contrary to the
               Procedures and Guidelines, or the recommendation of the Agent,
               where applicable, or if the Agent has made no recommendation and
               the Procedures and Guidelines are silent, the Proxy Coordinator
               will then implement the procedures for handling such votes as
               adopted by the Fund's Board.

               4.   The Proxy Coordinator will maintain a record of all proxy
                    questions that have been referred to a Fund's Valuation and
                    Proxy Voting Committee, all applicable recommendations,
                    analysis, research and Conflicts Reports.

IV.       CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

In connection with their participation in the voting process for portfolio
securities, each member of the Proxy Group and each Investment Professional
participating in the voting process must act solely in the best interests of the
beneficial owners of the applicable Fund. The members of the Proxy Group may not
subordinate the interests of the Fund's beneficial owners to unrelated
objectives.

For all matters for which the Proxy Group recommends a vote contrary to
Procedures and Guidelines, or the recommendation of the Agent, where applicable,
or where the Agent has made no recommendation and the Procedures and Guidelines
are silent, the Proxy Coordinator will implement the procedures for handling
such votes as adopted by the Fund's Board, including completion of such
Conflicts Reports as may be required under the Fund's procedures. Completed
Conflicts Reports shall be provided to the Proxy Coordinator within two (2)
business days. Such Conflicts Report should describe any known conflicts of
either a business or personal nature, and

<Page>

set forth any contacts with respect to the referral item with non-investment
personnel in its organization or with outside parties (except for routine
communications from proxy solicitors). The Conflicts Report should also include
written confirmation that any recommendation from an Investment Professional
provided under circumstances where a conflict of interest exists was made solely
on the investment merits and without regard to any other consideration.

The Proxy Coordinator shall forward all Conflicts Reports to a member of the
mutual funds practice group of ING US Legal Services ("Counsel") for review.
Counsel shall review each report and provide the Proxy Coordinator with a brief
statement regarding whether or not a material conflict of interest is present.
Matters as to which a conflict of interest is deemed to be present shall be
handled as provided in the Fund's Procedures and Guidelines.

V.        REPORTING AND RECORD RETENTION

The Adviser shall maintain the records required by Rule 204-2(c)(2), as may be
amended from time to time, including the following: (1) A copy of each proxy
statement received regarding a Fund's portfolio securities. Such proxy
statements received from issuers are available either in the SEC's EDGAR
database or are kept by the Agent and are available upon request. (2) A record
of each vote cast on behalf of a Fund. (3) A copy of any document created by the
Adviser that was material to making a decision how to vote a proxy, or that
memorializes the basis for that decision. (4) A copy of written requests for
Fund proxy voting information and any written response thereto or to any oral
request for information on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of a Fund.
All proxy voting materials and supporting documentation will be retained for a
minimum of six (6) years.

                    PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES OF THE ING FUNDS
                          Effective as of July 10, 2003
                As amended August 21, 2003 and November 11, 2003

                                 I. INTRODUCTION

The following is a statement of the proxy voting Guidelines that have been
adopted by the respective Boards of Directors or Trustees of each Fund.

Proxies must be voted in the best interest of the Fund. The Guidelines summarize
the Funds' positions on various issues of concern to investors, and give a
general indication of how Fund portfolio securities will be voted on proposals
dealing with particular issues. The Guidelines are not exhaustive and do not
include all potential voting issues.

The Advisers, in exercising their delegated authority, will abide by the
Guidelines as outlined below with regard to the voting of proxies except as
otherwise provided in the Procedures. In voting proxies, the Advisers are guided
by general fiduciary principles. Each must act prudently, solely in the interest
of the beneficial owners of the Funds it manages. The Advisers will not
subordinate the interest of beneficial owners to unrelated objectives. Each
Adviser will vote proxies in the manner that it believes will do the most to
maximize shareholder value.

II.       GUIDELINES

The following Guidelines are grouped according to the types of proposals
          generally presented to shareholders of U.S. issuers: Board of
          Directors, Proxy Contests, Auditors, Proxy Contest Defenses, Tender

                 consistent with his or her position(s) with a Fund and/or a
                 Fund's service provider(s) to ensure full, fair, accurate,
                 timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents
                 that a Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC or other
                 governmental authorities, and in other public communications
                 made by a Fund.

          6.     Comply with applicable laws and governmental rules and
                 regulations in his or her dealings with or on behalf of a Fund,
                 and take all reasonable actions, consistent with his or her
                 position(s) with a Fund and/or a Fund's service provider(s), to
                 ensure compliance by the Fund with applicable laws and
                 governmental rules and regulations.

          7.     Take all reasonable actions, consistent with his or her
                 position(s) with a Fund and/or a Fund's service provider(s), to
                 ensure prompt internal reporting of violations of this Code to

          8.     Not knowingly misrepresent, or knowingly cause or permit others

          9.     Consult with other officers and employees of a Fund, and its
                 adviser(s), administrator and principal underwriter, with the
                 goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
                 understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund
                 files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public
                 communications made by the Funds.

          10.    Promote compliance by the Funds with the standards and
                 restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

          11.    Not influence investment decisions or financial or other
                 reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit
                 personally.

D.        DEFINITIONS

          1.     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

          For the purposes of this Code (i) an "actual conflict of interest" is
a situation in which a Covered Officer, a member of a Covered Officer's
immediate family, or an entity other than a Fund on whose behalf a Covered
Officer is acting or from which a Covered Officer may receive compensation or
other personal benefit, has an interest in a transaction or the results of a
transaction in which a Fund is involved that is different from the interests of
the Fund with

<Page>

regard to that same transaction, and (ii) an "apparent conflict of interest" is
a situation in which a Covered Officer, a member of a Covered Officer's
immediate family, or an entity other than a Fund on whose behalf a Covered
Officer is acting or from which a Covered Officer may receive compensation or
other personal benefit, appears to have an actual conflict of interest, without
regard to whether an actual conflict of interest in fact exists. (3)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an actual conflict of interest shall not include
situations that are covered by law or by the Funds' and an investment adviser's
code of ethics required under Rule 17j-1 of the Investment Company Act of
1940.(4)

          2.     WAIVER AND IMPLICIT WAIVER

          The term "waiver" means the approval by a Fund of a material departure
from a provision of this Code. The term "implicit waiver" means a failure by a
Fund to take action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material
departure from a provision of this Code that has been made known to an executive
officer(5) of the Fund.

          3.     BENEFIT PERSONALLY; IMMEDIATE FAMILY

          With regard to a Covered Officer, the term "benefit personally" means
the direct or indirect receipt by the Covered Officer, by a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family, or by any entity (other than a Fund's

- ----------
(3) Certain actual conflicts of interest are inherent in the relationship
between a Fund and a Covered Officer who is employed by the Fund's investment
adviser, administrator or principal underwriter. As a result, this Code
recognizes that Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties
(whether acting on behalf of a Fund or on behalf of the adviser, administrator
or principal underwriter, or for a combination thereof), be involved in
recommending actions that may have different effects on the respective parties
or may redound to the benefit of the adviser, the administrator or the principal
underwriter at the expense of the Fund. For example, the negotiation of the
underlying advisory, administrative and underwriting agreements necessarily
places such Covered Officers in an actual conflict of interest position as to a
Fund.

          These inherent conflicts of interest are known to and understood by
the Funds and the Board, and the Board has determined that the existence of
these conflicts of interest is consistent with the performance by the Covered
Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Therefore, the fact that a
Covered Officer acts primarily or exclusively on behalf of a party other than a
Fund with regard to a transaction that is covered by such inherent conflicts of
interest shall not IPSO FACTO cause such conduct to be in violation of the
requirements of this Code. Absent specific dishonest or unethical conduct in
such a transaction, the actions by a Covered Officer in such regard shall be
deemed to be honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships.

(4) These inherent conflicts of interest are already subject to prohibitions in
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act") and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Investment Advisers Act"). For example, a
Covered Officer may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as the
purchase of sale or securities or other property) with a Fund because of his or
her status as an "affiliated person" of the Fund. The Funds' and the investment
adviser's compliance programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or
identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does not, and is
not intended to, repeat and replace those programs and procedures, and such
actual and apparent conflicts of interest fall outside of the coverage of this
Code. All other actual and apparent conflicts of interest, even if such actual
and apparent conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the
Investment Company Act or the Investment Advisers Act, are covered by this Code.

(5) The term "executive officer," when used with reference to a registrant,
means its president, any vice president of the registrant in charge of a
principal business unit, division or function (such as sales, administration or
finance), any other officer who performs a policy making function or any other
person who performs similar policy making functions for the registrant.

investment adviser or any affiliate thereof) of which the Covered Officer or any
member of the Covered Officer's immediate family owns 5% or more of the
beneficial ownership interest or by which the Covered Officer or any member of
the Covered Officer's immediate family is employed, or from which the Covered
Officer or any member of the Covered Officer's immediate family receives any
compensation or other benefit, of any compensation or other personal benefit.
For the purposes of this Code, the term "member of the immediate family" means a
Covered Officer's parent, spouse of a parent, child, spouse of a child, spouse,
brother, or sister, and includes step and adoptive relationships.

E.        ACTIVITIES REQUIRING PRIOR APPROVAL

          A Covered Officer and his or her immediate family shall not engage in
any of the following activities without the prior written approval of the Funds'
Chief Legal Officer (the "Chief Legal Officer") and the Funds' Chief Executive
Officer, except that in the case of the Chief Executive Officer or a member of
the Chief Executive Officer's immediate family, such approval shall be from the
Chief Legal Officer and the Coordination and Compliance Committee of the Board.
To obtain such approval, the Covered Officer shall submit a written statement to
the Chief Legal Officer describing in detail the proposed activity and the
reasons for it.

          1.     Service as a director, partner, officer, manager or managing
                 member on the board of any public or private company(6) other
                 than a Fund's investment adviser, administrator, principal
                 underwriter, or an affiliate of any of the foregoing, if such
                 company has current or prospective business dealings with a
                 Fund or if any Fund may invest in securities issued by such
                 company.

          2.     Receipt of any entertainment(7) or meals from any company with
                 which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings
                 unless such entertainment or meals are business-related,
                 reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not
                 so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety. For the
                 purposes of this Code, entertainment and meals that are
                 incidental to a business conference, seminar or meeting shall
                 be deemed business-related, reasonable in cost, and appropriate
                 as to time and place.

          3.     Having any ownership interest in, or any consulting, employment
                 or compensation relationship with, any of a Fund's service
                 providers, other than its investment adviser(s), administrator,
                 principal underwriter, or any affiliated person thereof.

          4.     Exploit for his or her own personal gain any opportunity which
                 a Fund may exploit. This prohibition shall not apply to
                 securities trading undertaken in conformance with the Funds'
                 and an investment adviser's code of ethics adopted pursuant to
                 Rule 17j-1 of the Investment Company Act.

F.        PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES

          A Covered Officer and his or her immediate family shall not engage in
          any of the following activities:

          1.     Have a direct or indirect financial interest, such as
                 compensation or equity ownership, in commissions, transaction
                 charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
                 transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
                 interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment with the
                 Fund's investment adviser, administrator, principal
                 underwriter, or any affiliated person thereof.

- ----------
(6) For the purposes of this Code, "company" includes any legal or business
entity such as a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, limited
partnership, trust, association, sole proprietorship, ETC.

(7) For the purposes of this Code, "entertainment" means activities or events,
such as golfing, theater, sporting events, ETC., at which a representative of
the entertaining company is present along with the Covered Officer or his or her
immediate family member. If a representative of the entertaining company is not
present, such activities or events shall be treated as gifts hereunder.

          2.     Receive any gifts in excess of $500 in any calendar year from
                 any entity or person that directly or indirectly currently or
                 prospectively does or will do business with or receives
                 compensation or other benefits from a Fund. For the purposes of
                 this restriction, gifts from different persons employed by the
                 same entity shall be aggregated, along with any gifts from the
                 entity itself, in order to determine whether the $500 limit has
                 been exceeded.

          3.     Accept employment from any company, other than a Fund's
                 investment adviser(s), administrator or principal underwriter
                 (or any affiliate thereof), with which the Fund has current or
                 prospective business dealings within one year after the latest
                 to occur of such Covered Officer's termination of employment at
                 the Fund or at the Fund's investment adviser(s), administrator
                 or principal underwriter (or any affiliate thereof).

          4.     Borrow money from any Fund, or borrow money from or have any
                 other financial transactions with any company, other than a
                 Fund's investment adviser(s), administrator or principal
                 underwriter (or any affiliate thereof), with which the Fund has
                 current or prospective business dealings, other than routine
                 retail transactions that are effected on the same terms and
                 conditions as are available to the general public.

          5.     Engage in a transaction directly as a principal with a Fund,
                 except that this prohibition shall not apply to the purchase or
                 redemption of the shares of any Fund on the same terms and
                 conditions as all other shareholders.

          6.     Any other activity that would cause them to benefit personally
                 at the expense of a Fund.

G.        REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

          1.     REPORTING

          Each Covered Officer must:

                 a.     Upon adoption of this Code (or thereafter, as
                        applicable, upon becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in
                        writing to the Chief Legal Officer and the Board that he
                        or she has received, read and understands this Code.
                        Such affirmation shall be substantially in the form
                        attached hereto as EXHIBIT B.

                 b.     Annually thereafter affirm to the Chief Legal Officer
                        and the Board that he or she has complied with the
                        requirements of this Code. Such affirmation shall be
                        substantially in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT C.

                 c.     Report at least annually all employment, ownership,
                        affiliations or other relationships related to conflicts
                        of interest that the Fund's Directors and Officers
                        Questionnaire covers.

                 d.     Notify the Chief Legal Officer promptly if he or she
                        knows of any violation of this Code or of any applicable
                        laws and governmental rules and regulations. Failure to
                        do so is itself a violation of this Code.

          2.     INTERPRETATIONS

          The Chief Legal Officer has the authority and shall be responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations and for making interpretations of this
Code in any particular situation. In making interpretations of this Code, the
Chief Legal Officer may consult with the Funds' outside counsel.

          3.     INVESTIGATIONS

          The Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

                 a.     The Chief Legal Officer will take all appropriate action
                        to investigate any potential violations reported to him
                        or her.

<Page>

                 b.     If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer
                        believes that no violation has occurred, the Chief Legal
                        Officer is not required to take any further action.

                 c.     If, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer
                        believes that a violation has occurred, the Chief Legal
                        Officer shall report such potential violation to the
                        Coordination and Compliance Committee.

                 d.     If the Coordination and Compliance Committee concurs
                        that a violation has occurred, it will inform and make a
                        recommendation to the Board, which will consider
                        appropriate action, which may include review of, and
                        appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and
                        procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the
                        investment adviser or its board; and a recommendation to
                        discipline or dismiss the Covered Officer or to require
                        reimbursement or disgorgement by the Covered Officer of
                        any personal benefits received.

          4.     WAIVERS

          The Coordination and Compliance Committee and the Chief Legal Officer,
as applicable, may grant a waiver to compliance with this Code by a Covered
Officer or his or her immediate family if the Coordination and Compliance
Committee or the Chief Legal Officer determines that the proposed activity will
not have an adverse impact on any Fund or on the ability of a Covered Officer
faithfully to perform his or her duties to the Funds. To obtain a waiver, a
Covered Officer shall submit a written statement to the Chief Legal Officer
describing in detail the proposed activity, and the reasons for it, and the
provision(s) of this Code as to which a waiver is requested. Any waivers of the
provisions of this Code shall be disclosed to the extent required by law and SEC
rules.

H.        RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

          This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser(s), administrator,
principal underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern
the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code,
they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict
with the provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment advisers' and
principal underwriter's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment
Company Act are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and
others, and are not part of this Code.

I.        CONFIDENTIALITY

          All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board or committee
thereof or the Funds' outside counsel.

J.        INTERNAL USE

          The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund or any Covered Officer
or his or her immediate family, as to any fact, circumstance, or legal
conclusion.

K.        AMENDMENTS

          Any amendments to this Code must be approved or ratified by a majority
vote of the Board, including a majority of the independent directors. Any
amendments to this Code shall be disclosed to the extent required by law and SEC
rules.

                                  CERTIFICATION

I, James M. Hennessy, certify that:

1.     I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of ING PRIME RATE TRUST;

2.     Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the

3.     Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the
financial condition, results of operations, changes in net assets, and cash
flows (if the financial statements are required to include a statement of cash
flows) of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;

4.     The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 30a-2(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and
have:

       a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
       material information relating to the registrant, including its
       consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
       entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being
       prepared;

       b) evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
       and procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing date of

       the disclosure controls and procedures based on our evaluation as of the
       Evaluation Date;

5.     The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on
our most recent evaluation, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
functions):

       a) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal
       controls which could adversely affect the registrant's ability to record,
       process, summarize, and report financial data and have identified for the
       registrant's auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls; and

       b) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
       employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
       controls; and

6. The registrant's other certifying officers and I have indicated in this
report whether or not there were significant changes in internal controls or in
other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to
the date of our most recent evaluation, including any corrective actions with
regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.
