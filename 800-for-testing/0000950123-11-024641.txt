                              REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Members and Board of Directors of
     UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members' capital of UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C. (the
"Fund"),  including the schedule of portfolio investments,  as of December 31, 2010, and the related statements of
operations and cash flows for the year then ended,  the statements of changes in members'  capital for each of the
two years in the period then ended,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the five years in the period then
ended. These financial  statements and financial  highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these  financial  statements  and  financial  highlights  based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting  Oversight Board (United
States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether
the  financial  statements  and financial  highlights  are free of material  misstatement.  We were not engaged to
perform an audit of the Fund's internal  control over financial  reporting.  Our audits included  consideration of
internal  control over financial  reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but not for the  purpose of  expressing  an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Fund's  internal
control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and the  disclosures  in the  financial  statements  and  financial
highlights,  assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement  presentation.  Our procedures included  confirmation of investments in investment
funds as of December 31, 2010, by  correspondence  with management of the underlying  investment funds. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  and financial  highlights  referred to above  present  fairly,  in all
material  respects,  the  financial  position of UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  at December  31,  2010,  the results of its
operations  and its cash flows for the year then ended,  the changes in its  members'  capital for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial  highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

1.   ORGANIZATION

     UBS M2 Fund,  L.L.C.  (the "Fund") was organized as a limited liability company under the laws of Delaware on
     August 13, 2001 and commenced  operations on February 1, 2003.  The Fund is registered  under the  Investment
     Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"),  as a closed-end,  non-diversified,  management  investment
     company. The Fund's investment  objective is to seek capital  appreciation over the long-term.  The Fund is a
     multi-manager  fund that seeks to achieve its  objective  by  deploying  its assets  among a select  group of
     portfolio  managers who primarily employ  long/short  equity  strategies,  including those involving  foreign
     issuers. Generally, such portfolio managers conduct their investment programs through unregistered investment
     funds  (collectively,  the "Investment  Funds"),  in which the Fund invests as a limited  partner,  member or
     shareholder along with other investors.

     The Fund's  Board of  Directors  (the  "Directors")  have  overall  responsibility  to manage and control the
     business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the  exclusive  authority  to oversee  and to  establish  policies
     regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.

     As of September 30, 2010, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement,  the Directors have engaged UBS
     Alternative and Quantitative  Investments LLC ("UBS A&Q", the "Adviser" and when providing services under the
     Administration  Agreement, the "Administrator"),  a Delaware limited liability company, to provide investment
     advice regarding the selection of Investment Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the
     Fund.  UBS A&Q is a wholly owned  subsidiary of UBS AG and is  registered as an investment  adviser under the
     Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. In addition to the assignment of  responsibilities,  the capital
     balance as of September 30, 2010 was transferred from UBSFA (defined below) to UBS A&Q.

     Prior to the  Assignment  and  Assumption  Agreement,  the  Directors  had engaged UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.
     ("UBSFA"),  a Delaware  limited  liability  company,  in the roles of Adviser and  Administrator.  UBSFA is a
     wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS AG and is registered
     as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional  applications for interests by eligible investors may be accepted at such times as the
     Directors may determine and are generally  accepted  monthly.  The Directors  reserve the right to reject any
     application for interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant to written tenders to Members.  These
     repurchases  will be made at such times and on such terms as may be  determined  by the  Directors,  in their
     complete  and  exclusive  discretion.  Members can only  transfer or assign their  membership  interests or a
     portion  thereof (i) by operation of law pursuant to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency or  dissolution of a
     Member, or (ii) with the written approval of the Directors,


                                                                                                                 7

     which may be withheld in their sole and absolute  discretion.  Such transfers may be made even if the balance
     of the  capital  account  to such  transferee  is equal  to or less  than the  transferor's  initial  capital
     contribution.

2.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In January 2010, the Financial Accounting  Standards Board ("FASB") issued Codification  Accounting Standards
     Update No. 2010-06,  Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements ("ASU 2010-06").  ASU 2010-06 amends
     Topic 820, Fair Value  Measurements and Disclosures to add new  requirements for disclosures  about transfers
     into and out of Levels 1 and 2, and separate disclosures about purchases,  sales, issuances,  and settlements
     relating to Level 3 measurements.  This update also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level
     of  disaggregation  for the  classes  of assets  and  liabilities  and the  disclosures  about the inputs and
     valuation  techniques used to measure fair value. ASU 2010-06 is effective for the interim and annual periods
     beginning  after  December  15, 2009 and for periods  beginning  after  December 15, 2010 for the new Level 3
     disclosures.  The adoption of ASU 2010-06 new disclosures and  clarification of existing  disclosures did not
     have a material impact on the Fund's financial statements.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The Fund  values its  investments  at fair value,  in  accordance  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
     principles  ("GAAP"),  which is the price  that  would be  received  to sell an asset or paid to  transfer  a
     liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

     Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of the Fund's  investments  which are summarized in the
     three broad levels listed below.

     LEVEL 1-- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     LEVEL 2-- fair value of investments  in Investment  Funds with the ability to redeem at net asset value as of
     the measurement date, or within one year of the measurement date

     LEVEL 3-- fair value of investments  in Investment  Funds that do not have the ability to redeem at net asset
     value within one year of the measurement date

     The Fund recognizes  transfers into and out of the levels indicated above at the end of the reporting period.
     All transfers into and out of Level 3 can be found in the Level 3 reconciliation table within the Schedule of
     Portfolio Investments.


                                                                                                                 8

                                                                                               UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C.

                                                                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

                                                                                                 DECEMBER 31, 2010

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     GAAP provides guidance in determining  whether there has been a significant  decrease in the volume and level
     of activity for an asset or liability  when compared with normal market  activity for such asset or liability
     (or similar assets or liabilities).  GAAP also provides guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a
     transaction with regards to such an asset or liability is not orderly.  In its  consideration,  the Fund must
     consider inputs and valuation  techniques used for each class of assets and liabilities.  Judgment is used to
     determine  the  appropriate  classes  of assets  and  liabilities  for which  disclosures  about  fair  value
     measurements  are  provided.  Fair value  measurement  disclosures  for each class of assets and  liabilities
     requires  greater  disaggregation  than the Fund's line items in the  Statement  of Assets,  Liabilities  and
     Members'  Capital.  The Fund  determines the  appropriate  classes for those  disclosures on the basis of the
     nature and risks of the assets and liabilities and their  classification  in the fair value hierarchy  (i.e.,
     Levels 1, 2, and 3).

     For assets and liabilities  measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period,  the Fund provides
     quantitative  disclosures  about  the fair  value  measurements  separately  for each  class  of  assets  and
     liabilities,  as well as a reconciliation  of beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets and liabilities
     broken down by class.

     The following is a summary of the investment strategy and any restrictions on the liquidity provisions of the
     investments in Investment  Funds held in the Fund as of December 31, 2010.  Investment  Funds with no current
     redemption  restrictions  may be  subject to future  gates,  lock-up  provisions  or other  restrictions,  in
     accordance with their offering  documents.  The Fund had no unfunded  capital  commitments as of December 31,
     2010.

     The Investment Funds in the long/short  equity strategy invest in both long and short equity  strategies that
     are primarily in common stocks. The management of these Investment Funds has the ability to shift investments
     from  value to growth  strategies,  from small to large  capitalization  common  stocks,  and from a net long
     position to a net short position.  Investment Funds within this strategy are generally  subject to a 15 - 125
     day redemption notice period.  Investment Funds  representing  approximately 2 percent of fair value are side
     pockets or  liquidating  trusts  where the  liquidation  of assets is expected  over the next 24 months.  The
     remaining approximately 98 percent of the Investment Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing in
     the future (5 percent) or are available to be redeemed  with no  restrictions  (93  percent),  subject to the
     Investment  Funds' liquidity terms, as of the measurement  date. Nine Investment  Funds, with a fair value of
     $117,532,343, transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 at December 31, 2010.

     A detailed  depiction of each  investment in the portfolio by investment  strategy,  including any additional
     liquidity  terms  and  other  restrictions,  as well as a  breakdown  of the  portfolio  into the fair  value
     measurement levels, can be found in the tables within the Schedule of Portfolio Investments.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the direction of the Adviser as of the close of business
     at the end of any fiscal period in  accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set forth below or as may be
     determined  from time to time pursuant to policies  established by the Directors.  The Fund's  investments in
     Investment Funds are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective  operating agreements and offering
     memorandums,  as  appropriate.  The Fund's  investments  in Investment  Funds are carried at fair value.  All
     valuations  utilize  financial  information  supplied by each  Investment  Fund and are net of management and
     performance  incentive  fees or  allocations  payable to the  Investment  Funds'  managers or pursuant to the
     Investment Funds'  agreements.  The Fund's valuation  procedures require the Adviser to consider all relevant
     information available at the time the Fund values its portfolio.  The Adviser has assessed factors including,
     but not  limited  to the  individual  Investment  Funds'  compliance  with  fair  value  measurements,  price
     transparency and valuation procedures in place, and subscription and redemption activity.  The Adviser and/or
     the Directors will consider such information and consider whether it is appropriate, in light of all relevant
     circumstances,  to value such a position  at its net asset value as reported or whether to adjust such value.
     The  underlying  investments  of each  Investment  Fund are  accounted for at fair value as described in each
     Investment Fund's financial statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

     The fair value relating to certain  underlying  investments of these Investment  Funds, for which there is no
     ready market,  has been estimated by the respective  Investment Funds' management and is based upon available
     information in the absence of readily  ascertainable  fair values and does not necessarily  represent amounts
     that might ultimately be realized. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation,  those estimated fair values
     may differ  significantly  from the values that would have been used had a ready  market for the  investments
     existed. These differences could be material.

     It is unknown on an aggregate  basis whether the  Investment  Funds held any  investments  whereby the Fund's
     proportionate share exceeded 5% of the Fund's net assets at December 31, 2010.

     The fair value of the Fund's assets and liabilities which qualify as
     financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented in the
     Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

     B.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

     The Fund accounts for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund transactions based on the pro-rata ratio
     of the fair  value and cost of the  underlying  investment  at the date of  redemption.  Interest  income and
     expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.


                                                                                                                10

     C.   FUND EXPENSES

     The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not limited to, the following: all costs
     and expenses related to portfolio  transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees; accounting
     and auditing  fees;  custodial  fees;  costs of computing  the Fund's net asset  value;  costs of  insurance;
     registration expenses; interest expense; offering and organization costs; due diligence, including travel and
     related expenses; expenses of meetings of Directors; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and
     other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Fund has  reclassified  $11,344,073 and $22,877,372  from accumulated net investment loss and accumulated
     net realized gain from investments in Investment Funds, respectively, to net capital contributions during the
     year ended December 31, 2010. The reclassification was to reflect, as an adjustment to net contributions, the
     amount of estimated  taxable income or loss that have been allocated to the Fund's Members as of December 31,
     2010 and had no effect on members' capital.

     The Fund files income tax returns in the U.S.  federal  jurisdiction  and applicable  states.  Management has
     analyzed the Fund's tax  positions  taken on its federal and state income tax returns for all open tax years,
     and has  concluded  that no  provision  for federal or state  income tax is required in the Fund's  financial
     statements.  The Fund's federal and state income tax returns for tax years for which the applicable  statutes
     of  limitations  have not  expired are  subject to  examination  by the  Internal  Revenue  Service and state
     departments of revenue.  The Fund recognizes  interest and penalties,  if any,  related to  unrecognized  tax
     benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Fund
     did not incur any interest or penalties.

     Each Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return its  distributive  share of the Fund's
     taxable income or loss.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PFPC Trust Company account which pays money market
     rates and are accounted  for at cost plus accrued  interest  which is included in interest  receivable on the
     Statement of Assets,  Liabilities and Members'  Capital.  Such cash, at times, may exceed  federally  insured
     limits.  The Fund has not  experienced  any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any
     significant credit risk on such accounts.


                                                                                                                11

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     F.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with GAAP requires  management to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent  assets
     and liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and the reported  amounts of increases and decreases
     in members'  capital from  operations  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results could differ from those
     estimates.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement.
     Pursuant to that agreement,  the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the "Investment Management Fee") at the
     annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund's  members'  capital,  excluding  the capital  account  attributable  to the
     Adviser.

     The  Administrator  provides  certain  administrative  services to the Fund,  including,  among other things,
     providing  office space and other support  services.  In consideration  for such services,  the Fund pays the
     Administrator a monthly fee (the "Management Fee") at an annual rate of 0.30% of the Fund's members' capital,
     excluding the capital account attributable to the Adviser.  The Management Fee and the Investment  Management
     Fee will be paid to the Adviser out of the Fund's assets and debited against the Members'  capital  accounts,
     excluding the capital account attributable to the Adviser. A portion of the Investment Management Fee and the
     Management Fee is paid by UBS A&Q to its affiliates.

     UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc., acts as a placement
     agent for the Fund,  without special  compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated with its
     activities as placement  agent.  Placement  fees, if any,  charged on  contributions  are debited against the
     contribution amounts, to arrive at a net subscription amount. The placement fee does not constitute assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase or decrease in members' capital derived from operations (net income or loss) is allocated to
     the capital  accounts of all Members on a pro-rata  basis,  other than the Investment  Management Fee and the
     Management  Fee which are  similarly  allocated  to all Members  other than the Adviser or  Administrator  as
     described above.

     Each Director of the Fund  receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a fee for each meeting  attended.  The

     respectively.  These additional annual retainer amounts are paid for by the Fund on a pro-rata basis with ten
     other UBS funds where UBS A&Q is the  investment  adviser.  All Directors are  reimbursed by the Fund for all
     reasonable out of pocket expenses.

     Other  investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its  affiliates  may also  maintain  investment
     interests in the Investment Funds owned by the Fund.

5.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODY FEES

     PFPC Trust Company (the  "Custodian"),  which will be renamed BNY Mellon  Investment  Servicing Trust Company
     effective  July 1, 2011,  provides  custodial  services for the Fund.  The  Custodian  entered into a service
     agreement whereby PFPC Trust provides securities clearance functions, as needed.

     On July 1, 2010, the PNC Financial  Services Group,  Inc. sold the outstanding stock of PNC Global Investment
     Servicing Inc. to the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.  At the closing of the sale, PNC Global Investment
     Servicing  (U.S.),  Inc. changed its name to BNY Mellon  Investment  Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNY Mellon").  BNY
     Mellon serves as accounting and investor  servicing agent to the Fund and in that capacity  provides  certain
     administrative,  accounting,  record keeping, tax and Member related services.  BNY Mellon receives a monthly
     fee primarily based upon (i) the average  members'  capital of the Fund subject to a minimum monthly fee, and
     (ii) the aggregate  members'  capital of the Fund and certain other  investment funds sponsored or advised by
     UBS AG, UBS Americas,  Inc. or their  affiliates.  Additionally,  the Fund  reimburses  certain out of pocket
     expenses incurred by BNY Mellon.

     Effective  March 26, 2010, the Custodian and BNY Mellon have agreed to a fee reduction for  reimbursement  of
     the Fund's line of credit  commitment fees ("Fee  Reduction") for a period of 364 days from November 1, 2010,
     the effective date of the Fund's line of credit agreement with State Street Bank and Trust Company  ("Initial
     Term").  Based on the  methodology  within the  agreement,  the Custodian and BNY Mellon have agreed to waive
     $81,700 for the Fund over the Initial Term. For the period from  November,  1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, the
     Custodian  and BNY  Mellon  waived  $1,200  and  $12,417,  respectively,  which  is  shown  in  aggregate  as
     administration and custody fees waived on the Statement of Operations.

6.   LOAN PAYABLE

     rate on the  borrowing  is the higher of (a) 1.50%  above the  Overnight  LIBOR Rate and (b) 1.50%  above the
     Federal  Funds Rate,  in each case as in effect from time to time.  There is a commitment  fee payable by the

     annum and the average borrowings  outstanding were $8,333. The Fund had $1,500,000 of borrowings  outstanding
     at  December  31,  2010.  Interest  expense for the year ended  December  31, 2010 was $146 of which $146 was
     payable at December 31, 2010.

7.   INVESTMENTS

     As of December 31, 2010, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none of which were related parties.

     Aggregate  purchases and proceeds from sales of investment  for the year ended  December 31, 2010 amounted to
     $87,500,000 and $210,108,544, respectively.

     The cost of investments for federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items of taxable income  allocated to
     the Fund from the Investment  Funds.  The allocated  taxable income is reported to the Fund by the Investment
     Funds on Schedule K-1. The Fund has not yet received all such Schedule  K-1's for the year ended December 31,
     2010;  therefore,  the tax basis of  investments  for 2010 will not be  finalized by the Fund until after the
     fiscal year end.

     The  agreements  related  to  investments  in  Investment  Funds  provide  for  compensation  to the  general
     partners/managers  in the form of management fees of 1.00% to 2.00% (per annum) of net assets and performance
     incentive fees and allocations  ranging from 16.50% to 25.00% of net profits  earned.  One or more underlying
     fund  investments  have entered into a side pocket  arrangement.  Detailed  information  about the Investment
     Funds' portfolios is not available.

8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund invests  trade various  financial
     instruments and enter into various investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
     not limited to, short selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  contracts for differences,  and equity
     swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the fair value of these investments.

     In the  ordinary  course  of  business,  the Fund  may  enter  into  contracts  or  agreements  that  contain
     indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future events could occur that lead to the  execution of these  provisions

The  following  is a summary of the inputs used in valuing  the Fund's  investments  at fair value.  The inputs or
methodology used for valuing the Fund's  investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with
investing in those  investments.  The Fund's  valuation  procedures  require  evaluation  of all relevant  factors
available at the time the Fund values its portfolio.  These  relevant  factors  include the individual  Investment
Funds'  compliance  with fair value  measurements,  price  transparency  and valuation  procedures  in place,  and
subscription and redemption activity.

The Fund's  investments  are  categorized  in three levels as  disclosed  below.  Level 1 discloses  the amount of
investments  where the values of those  investments  are based upon quoted prices in active  markets for identical
securities.  Level 2  discloses  the amount of  investments  where the Fund has the ability to redeem at net asset
value as of the December 31, 2010 measurement  date, or within one year of the measurement date. Level 3 discloses

Net change in  unrealized  appreciation/depreciation  on Level 3 assets  still  held as of  December  31,  2010 is
$242,528.

*    Net  transfers in and/or (out) of Level 3 include  transfers  out of  Investment  Funds that were  previously
     categorized as Level 3 investments.

**   In the prior year,  Investment  Funds were  categorized as Level 2 investments if the Fund had the ability to
     redeem at net asset value as of the December 31, 2009 measurement date or within 90 days of such date.

The net transfers in and/or (out) of Level 3 noted above are due to the
liquidity of the underlying Investment Funds in relation to the change in the
measurement date from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2010.

                                          UBS M2 FUND, L.L.C. (UNAUDITED)

     The Directors (including the Independent  Directors) last evaluated the Investment  Management Agreement at a
meeting on November 18, 2010. The Directors met in an executive  session during which they were advised by and had
the opportunity to discuss with independent legal counsel the approval of the Investment Management Agreement. The
Directors  reviewed  materials  furnished by UBS Alternative  and  Quantitative  Investments LLC (the  "Adviser"),
including information regarding the Adviser, its affiliates and its personnel, operations and financial condition.
Tables  indicating  comparative fee information,  and comparative  performance  information,  as well as a summary
financial analysis for the Fund, were also included in the meeting materials and were reviewed and discussed.  The
Directors discussed with representatives of the Adviser the Fund's operations and the Adviser's ability to provide
advisory and other services to the Fund.

     The Directors reviewed, among other things, the nature of the advisory services to be provided to the Fund by
the Adviser,  including its investment process,  and the experience of the investment advisory and other personnel
proposing to provide services to the Fund. The Directors discussed the ability of the Adviser to manage the Fund's
investments in accordance with the Fund's stated investment objectives and policies, as well as the services to be
provided  by the  Adviser  to the Fund,  including  administrative  and  compliance  services,  oversight  of Fund
accounting,  marketing  services,  assistance  in meeting legal and  regulatory  requirements  and other  services
necessary for the operation of the Fund.  The Directors  acknowledged  the Adviser's  employment of highly skilled
investment professionals,  research analysts and administrative, legal and compliance staff members to ensure that
a high level of quality in compliance  and  administrative  services  would be provided to the Fund. The Directors
also recognized the benefits which the Fund derives from the resources  available to the Adviser and the Adviser's
affiliates,  including UBS AG and UBS Financial Services Inc. Accordingly,  the Directors felt that the quality of
service  offered by the Adviser to the Fund was  appropriate,  and that the  Adviser's  personnel  had  sufficient
expertise to manage the Fund.

     The Directors  reviewed the performance of the Fund and compared that performance to the performance of other
investment companies presented by the Adviser which had objectives and strategies similar to those of the Fund and
which are managed by other,  third-party  investment advisers  ("Comparable Funds"). The Directors recognized that
the Comparable Funds, as private funds, are not subject to certain  investment  restrictions  under the Investment
Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended,  that are  applicable  to the Fund and which can  adversely  affect the Fund's
performance  relative to that of its Comparable Funds. The Directors  observed that the Fund's 2010 performance as
of August 31, 2010 exceeded the median  performance of the Comparable  Funds and the relevant indexes (HFRI Equity
Hedge, HFRX Equity Hedge, MSCI World Index (MSDUWI),  Russell 2000 Index,  Russell 2000 Growth Index, Russell 2000
Value Index and S&P 500 DRI).  The Board also noted that the Fund's  performance  for the  five-year  period ended
August 31, 2010 exceeded the median performance of the Comparable Funds and relevant indexes,  and that the Fund's
performance  for the  three-year  period ended August 31, 2010  exceeded  the median  performance  of the relevant
indexes but lagged the performance of the Comparable Funds. The Directors also compared the volatility of the Fund
to that of its Comparable Funds. The Directors noted that for the three- and five-year periods ended August

31, 2010, the Fund's volatility was above the median volatility of the Comparable Funds and relevant indexes.

     The  Directors  considered  the  advisory  fees being  charged by the Adviser for its services to the Fund as
compared to those  charged to the  Comparable  Funds,  and as compared to the  advisory  fees  charged by UBS Fund
Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA") and its  affiliates for other UBS  alternative  investment  products,  noting that the
transition  of  management  of the Fund from UBSFA to the  Adviser  was  effective  as of  October  1,  2010.  The
information  presented to the Directors  showed that although the  combination  of the Fund's  management  fee and
service fee was above the median management fee of the Comparable Funds, the Fund did not charge an incentive fee.
In  comparing  the  advisory  fees  being  charged to the Fund to the fees being  charged by the  Adviser  and its
affiliates for other UBS alternative investment products, the Directors noted that although the combination of the
Fund's  management  fee and service fee was the second highest  management fee being charged to the  multi-manager
funds,  unlike most of the other  multi-manager  funds, the Fund was not subject to any incentive fee. In light of
the foregoing, the Directors felt that the management fee being charged to the Fund was appropriate and was within
the overall range of the fees paid by the Comparable Funds and other relevant UBS alternative investment products.

     The Directors also considered the profitability to UBSFA and UBS A&Q both before payment to brokers and after
payment to brokers and concluded that the profits to be realized by UBSFA and UBS A&Q and their  affiliates  under
the Fund's Investment  Management  Agreement and from other  relationships  between the Fund and UBSFA and UBS A&Q
were within a range the Directors  considered  reasonable and  appropriate.  The Directors also discussed the fact
that the Fund was not large  enough at that time to support a request for  breakpoints  due to economies of scale.
The Directors determined that the fees under the Investment  Management Agreement did not constitute fees that are
so disproportionally  large as to bear no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and that could not have
been the product of arm's length bargaining,  and concluded that the fees were reasonable. The Directors concluded
that approval of the Investment Management Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                                      UBSAQ
                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A. INTRODUCTION

     UBSAQ votes proxies for each fund (each a "Fund," collectively, the
"Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as such, has adopted these
Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies and Procedures"). The
Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in unregistered investment
vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other than the Fund.
Generally, each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets in non-voting
securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do not submit
matters to investors for vote; however, should a matter be submitted for vote
and provided the Fund holds voting interests in the Investment Fund, the Adviser
will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the Fund and in
accordance with these Policies and Procedures. The Board of Directors (the
"Board") of the Funds has adopted these Policies and Procedures as the Funds'.
The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's Policies and
Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

     Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process. The Adviser is under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize shareholder value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the Adviser's part to analyze the issues connected with the votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

     Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent with management's recommendations on routine matters, absent a
particular reason to the contrary. Non-routine matters will be voted on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     Any circumstance or relationship which would compromise a portfolio
manager's objectivity in voting proxies in the best interest of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest. In such situations, the Adviser will
address any material conflicts before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy, the Adviser will presume the existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

     -    A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment
          Fund soliciting proxies or has communicated its view to the Adviser on
          an impending proxy vote;

     -    The portfolio manager responsible for proxy-voting has identified a
          personal interest in the Investment Fund soliciting proxies or in the
          outcome of a shareholder vote;

Revised: June 26, 2006
Rebranded: 10/1/2010

<PAGE>

     -    Members of the portfolio management team, including the portfolio
          manager responsible for proxy-voting, and/or members of senior
          management, have a personal interest through investment in the
          Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

     -    Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in
          the outcome of a shareholder vote have attempted to influence either
          the Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.

Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser, from employees' personal
relationships or special circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business. Employees who become aware of any such conflicts of
interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal who will work with appropriate personnel of the
Adviser to determine the materiality of the conflict.

     ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. A conflict of interest will be
considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances. If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material,
the Adviser may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict. The
Adviser shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified,
the materiality determination, and the method used to resolve the material
conflict of interest.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution before voting proxies affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

     -    Disclosing the conflict and obtaining consent before voting (which
          consent in the case of the Fund(s) may be obtained from the Fund's
          board of directors);

     -    Engaging another party on behalf of the Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
          its behalf;

     -    Engaging a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the proxy
          based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

     -    Such other method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances
          given the nature of the conflict.

E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

     The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

Revised: June 26, 2006
Rebranded: 10/1/2010

<PAGE>

     Where the Funds hold voting rights, the Funds shall include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge, upon request by taking the specified action; and
(iii) a statement that information regarding how the Adviser voted proxies
relating to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period, is available upon
request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting rights, the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

     The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting
in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the
end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the
first two years on-site:

     -    A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

     -    A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

     -    A copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements) and
          related materials with regard to each vote;

     -    A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution
          of conflicts of interest;

     -    A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to a
          proxy -voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that
          decision; and

     -    A copy of each written investor request for information on how the
          Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s), and a copy of any
          written response from the Adviser to any (written or oral) investor
          request for information on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of
          the Fund(s).

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

            O'CONNOR FUND OF FUNDS: LONG/SHORT EQUITY STRATEGIES LLC
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

The Fund is managed by a portfolio management team, each member of which (each,
a "Portfolio Manager" and together, the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio. Norman E. Sienko, Jr., the
lead member of the portfolio management team, is primarily responsible for the
selection of the Fund's investments, and is jointly responsible for the
allocation of the Fund's assets among Investment Funds. Russell Sinder, Joseph
M. Sciortino and Matthew Woodbury, the other members of the portfolio management
team, are jointly and primarily responsible for the allocation of the Fund's
investments.

Mr. Sienko has served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception. He
served as head of UBS Alternative Investments US' ("AI - US") portfolio
management group from 1998 to 2010, prior to his group joining UBS Alternative
and Quantitative Investments LLC, the Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser").
He is also currently an Executive Director of the Adviser. Mr. Sinder has been a
Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2007. Mr. Sinder was associated with AI - US
from 1998 to 2010, prior to joining the Adviser, and is an Executive Director of
the Adviser. Mr. Sciortino joined the portfolio management team in 2007. He was
associated with AI - US from December 2006 to October 2010, prior to joining the
Adviser, and is a Director of the Adviser. Previously, Mr. Sinder served as
Senior Analyst at Lake Partners, Inc. from April 2001 through August 2006. Mr.
Woodbury was associated with AI - US from 2008 to 2010, prior to joining the
Adviser, and is a Director of the Adviser. Previously, he served as an Analyst
at Allianz Hedge Fund Partners, LP (2002-2008) and an Accountant at Arthur
Anderson LLP (1999-2002).

The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

<PAGE>

Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio Managers'
management of the Fund and other accounts. For example, conflicts of interest
may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of
limited investment opportunities. Allocations of investment opportunities
generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are
expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Conversely, a Portfolio
Manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem investments are placed. The Portfolio Managers may be
perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other
accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are managing on behalf of the
Adviser. In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio Managers' overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that differ
from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons, the Portfolio Managers may
purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts, and the
performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance
of the investments purchased for other accounts. The Portfolio Managers may
place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly
contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have the
potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

A potential conflict of interest may be perceived if the Adviser receives a
performance-based advisory fee as to one account but not another, because a
Portfolio Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether
or not the performance of that account directly determines the Portfolio
Manager's compensation.

The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its
clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly. The
Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage
and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address the
conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with
Fund guidelines. Furthermore, senior investment and business personnel of the
Adviser periodically review the performance of the Portfolio Managers.

The Portfolio Managers' compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed salary
and a discretionary bonus paid by the Adviser or its affiliates and not by the
Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid in shares of stock or
stock options of UBS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Adviser, subject to
certain vesting periods. The amount of a Portfolio Manager's discretionary
bonus, and the portion to be paid in shares or stock options of UBS AG, is
determined by senior officers of the Adviser. In general, the amount of the
bonus will be based on a combination of factors, none of which is necessarily
weighted more than any other factor. These factors may include: the overall
performance of the Adviser; the overall performance of UBS AG; the profitability
to the Adviser derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts
managed by the Adviser; the absolute performance of the Fund and such other
accounts for the preceding year; contributions by the Portfolio Manager to
assisting in managing the Adviser; participation by the Portfolio Manager in
training of personnel; and support by the Portfolio Manager generally to
colleagues. The bonus is not based on a precise formula, benchmark or other
metric.

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by the
Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.
