                                 GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                                 Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                                 structure combines the specialized expertise of
                                 three world-class investment management
                                 groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE            Each of our portfolio management groups
                                 operates autonomously, relying on its own
                                 research and staying true to the unique
                                 investment disciplines that underlie its
                                 success.

                                 FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                                 recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                                 also brings expertise in growth- and
                                 value-style U.S. equity investing.

                                 TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                                 international investing and, in 1954, launched
                                 what has become the industry's oldest global
                                 fund. Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                                 Templeton offers investors a truly global
                                 perspective.

                                 MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series
                                 is dedicated to a unique style of value
                                 investing, searching aggressively for
                                 opportunity among what it believes are
                                 undervalued stocks, as well as arbitrage
                                 situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION             Because our management groups work
                                 independently and adhere to different
                                 investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and
                                 Mutual Series funds typically have distinct
                                 portfolios. That's why our funds can be used to
                                 build truly diversified allocation plans
                                 covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST        At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                                 consistently provide investors with exceptional
                                 risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as
                                 well as the reliable, accurate and personal
                                 service that has helped us become one of the
                                 most trusted names in financial services.

A Message from Gregory E. Johnson,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Franklin Resources, Inc.

                                                                October 31, 2008

Dear Shareholder:

The enclosed semiannual report for Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
Trust covers the six months ended September 30, 2008, but I would like to add
some comments on market events that occurred in October. Recent market
volatility has been jarring to everyone, including those of us who have worked
in financial markets for many years. Bank lending around the world has seized
up, and the fallout has impacted venerable firms alongside broader stock and
bond indexes.

This environment is bound to provoke great concern, but it's equally important
to put the latest market developments in perspective. That's why I'd like to
offer a few thoughts on these events, our company's approach to investing and
the strong health of our organization.

A key point to recognize is that global financial turmoil is being addressed by
global action. Central banks around the world have coordinated their efforts to
cut interest rates and supply liquidity to frozen funding markets. A number of
governments have also intervened to rescue major financial institutions or find
an orderly way for them to be acquired. Here in the U.S., the Federal Reserve
and Treasury Department have moved rapidly to establish new programs for easing
money market pressures and handling troubled financial assets. The outcome of
all these efforts may take a while to be realized, but I believe the latest
actions here and abroad mark a significant turning point for global capital
markets.

It's also important to remember that as daunting as current market conditions
may be, we have navigated through other periods of market volatility. U.S. stock
markets recorded three bear markets during the 1960s as the nation grappled with
the Vietnam War and a turbulent economy.(1) The quintupling of oil prices in
1973 led to a deep U.S. recession and a stock market plunge of 45.1% from
January 1973 through December 1974.(1) And the "Black Monday" stock market crash
of 1987 remains the largest single-day percentage decline in the history of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.(2)

Advice applicable throughout these upheavals remains true today. The late Sir
John Templeton, writing 15 years ago, ended a list of his core investment
principles with these thoughts: "Do not be fearful or negative too often. . . .
For 100 years optimists have carried the day in U.S. stocks. Even in the dark
'70s, many professional money managers -- and many individual investors too --
made money in stocks .... In this century or the next it's still 'Buy low, sell
high.'"(3)

Sir John knew these simple concepts were difficult to execute in the face of
pessimism. Nonetheless, that is precisely how our Franklin, Templeton and Mutual
Series portfolio managers are contending with today's challenging environment.
They are using their expertise to sort through investment opportunities,
avoiding those firms that have become merely cheap and identifying those firms
best positioned to be eventual winners. This kind of rigorous, bottom-up,
security-by-security analysis is the fundamental investment discipline practiced
across our global platform.

These asset management strengths are also the core of our business. Unlike
financial firms that have dominated recent headlines, Franklin Templeton derives
its revenue primarily from investment management, not investment banking or
securities brokerage. Additionally, our assets under management are diversified
by investment objective, clientele and geographic region. Diversified
positioning helps our firm maintain healthy operating margins even when volatile
markets reduce assets under management. It is also important to note that
maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a pillar of our management strategy.
We have a substantial pool of cash and investments and low levels of debt, and
we are in the enviable position of not having to depend on credit to meet our
operating needs. In fact, our strong franchise, sound capitalization

and minimal leverage led Standard & Poor's to recently raise its credit ratings
on Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN) to the highest level currently applied to a
publicly traded asset manager.(4)

Franklin Templeton's six-decade growth into a premier global asset manager has
given us the conviction that although conditions remain challenging, there are
ample reasons to be optimistic about eventual market stabilization and recovery.
Being able to take advantage of markets shaken by maximum pessimism has helped
our firm develop into an organization that stretches across 29 countries and
manages assets for more than 20 million shareholder accounts.

Trust, the portfolio managers discuss market conditions, investment decisions
and Fund performance during the six months ended September 30, 2008. The report

Semiannual Report

Franklin Templeton
Limited Duration Income Trust

YOUR FUND'S GOALS AND MAIN INVESTMENTS: Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust seeks to provide high, current income, with a secondary objective
of capital appreciation to the extent it is possible and consistent with the
Fund's primary objective, through a portfolio consisting primarily of high yield
corporate bonds, floating rate bank loans and mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities.

Dear Shareholder:

This semiannual report for Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust
covers the period ended September 30, 2008.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
Trust had cumulative total returns of -4.88% based on net asset value and
- -20.09% based on market price. Net asset value decreased from $12.85 per share
on March 31, 2008, to $11.78 at period-end, and the market price fell from
$10.94 to $8.36 over the same time. You can find the Fund's performance data in
the Performance Summary on page 10.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

During the six months under review, financial market conditions deteriorated
sharply, weighing heavily on the U.S. economy as the credit crisis that
originated in the U.S. housing market worsened. Job losses mounted and the
unemployment rate rose to 6.1% during the reporting period.(1) Home prices
continued to fall and default rates rose as wages remained essentially flat.
Waning consumer confidence led to a pullback in consumer spending as the impact
of the government's tax rebates dissipated. These factors as well as upward
inflationary pressures from a weak U.S. dollar and high food, energy and
commodity

prices burdened the overall economy. The economy grew at a 2.8% annualized rate
in the second quarter of 2008 but contracted in the third quarter at a -0.3%
estimated annualized rate.

Oil prices soared to a record high in July, rising above $145 per barrel, before
dramatically retreating to $101 by period-end. Many other commodities such as
agricultural products and precious and base metals followed similar trends.
September's inflation rate was an annual 4.9%, largely due to higher food and
energy costs. Core inflation, which excludes such costs, rose at a more moderate
2.5% annual rate; however, this level was above the Federal Reserve Board's
(Fed's) informal target range of 1.5%-2.0%.(1) The core personal consumption
expenditures price index reported a 12-month increase of 2.4%.(2)

Amid a series of events that included massive government intervention and
emergency funding, the Fed was focused primarily on restoring liquidity and
confidence to unsettled financial markets. The Fed cut interest rates twice over
the six-month period, bringing the federal funds target rate to 2.00%, and it
implemented a series of unconventional measures aimed at easing strained credit
conditions. The U.S. Treasury Department also agreed to temporarily guarantee
money market funds against losses after the Reserve Primary Fund and two others
"broke the buck," falling below one dollar in value. In the final days of the
reporting period, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke proposed a $700 billion bailout plan intended to save the financial
system.

Volatility remained high throughout the reporting period but intensified in
September as stocks fluctuated wildly and Treasury prices soared. Panicked
investors drove the yield on the three-month Treasury bill to a multi-decade
low, and LIBOR rates, which banks charge each other for loans, jumped to record
highs. Although fixed income spreads were generally wide relative to Treasury
yields over the period due to heightened market turbulence, two-, five- and
10-year Treasury yields increased, with the two-year bill yielding 2.00% at the
end of September, up from 1.62% six months earlier. Over the same period, the
10-year U.S. Treasury note yield rose from 3.45% to 3.85%. The yield curve
steepened and the spread between the two-year Treasury yield and the 10-year
Treasury yield increased to 185 basis points (100 basis points equal one
percentage point) at the end of September from 38 basis points at the beginning
of the reporting period as investors sought the relative safety of short-term
U.S. Treasury securities.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, primarily high yield
corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and mortgage- and
other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of macroeconomic trends
combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and
issuers drives our investment process. We seek to maintain a limited duration,
or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the impact that fluctuating interest
rates might have on the Fund's fixed income portfolio. Within the corporate bond
and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable valuations from
issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions, stable cash flows,
reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and
improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream and total
return through our analysis of security prepayment assumptions, pricing
inefficiencies and underlying collateral characteristics.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The semiannual period under review was characterized by the deepening financial
crisis that began last year as losses worsened on subprime mortgage-backed
securities (MBS). Credit tightened as even high-quality borrowers had difficulty
accessing capital, and banks were reluctant to lend to one another. The entire
American financial landscape changed during the review period, which began just
after Bear Stearns was sold to JPMorgan Chase in a hastily arranged deal
intended to avert the investment banker's impending bankruptcy. The period ended
with a frenetic chain of events in September that included Lehman Brothers'
failure and what was essentially the nationalization of mortgage giants Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac and the world's largest insurance company, American
International Group. Given the severe capital market dislocations, virtually no
asset class was immune from the turmoil. During the six months under review, the
Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) fell 10.87%, while the Barclay's Capital
(BC; formerly Lehman Brothers) U.S. Aggregate Index, a broad measure of the bond
market, declined 1.50%.(3) Even Treasuries,

which are generally considered a safe haven in turbulent markets, returned only
0.15% as a rise in yields resulted in price declines that largely offset the
coupon income.(4) The increase in Treasury yields was driven by expectations of
increased budget deficits due to the cost of government bailouts and potentially
declining tax revenues. In this environment, the fundamental underpinnings of
the high yield corporate bond and leveraged loan markets deteriorated
significantly. Although default rates for these two asset classes were below
average, many analysts expected defaults could increase over the coming year if
the credit crunch exacerbates the economic slowdown. Largely as a result, high
yield corporate bonds and leveraged loans had negative returns during the
reporting period. After the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
mortgage-backed securities (MBS) rallied and ended the period with modest gains.
During the review period, we reduced our high yield exposure and invested part
of the proceeds in investment-grade corporate bonds, particularly those of
financial companies. We also slightly reduced our exposure to bank loans and
increased our investments in MBS.

The fundamental outlook for high yield bonds deteriorated sharply during the
reporting period as the economy slowed and fears increased that a recession may
already be under way. As the credit crunch intensified, concerns grew that the
crisis would move from the financial sector to the overall economy. Many
believed the lack of liquidity could lead to higher default rates in the months
ahead. Reflecting the troubled outlook, high yield spreads widened to over 1,000
basis points (10 percentage points) above Treasuries -- their highest level
since 2002. We believed fundamentals could deteriorate further; therefore, we
reduced our high yield exposure and purchased investment-grade debt, including
that of major financial companies. However, given the financial market turmoil
during the period, the investment-grade sector was the worst performing segment
in the BC U.S. Aggregate Index. Fund holdings included the senior notes of
Lehman Brothers, which filed for bankruptcy protection in September.

For the six-month period under review, the bank loan asset class was extremely
volatile, with few pockets of strength in a generally weak overall market, and
the Credit Suisse (CS) Leveraged Loan Index had a -1.93% total return.(5) Early
in the review period, the loan market rallied as investors seemed to find the
sector's valuations attractive, and loan prices rebounded to a period high in
June. As secondary loan prices stabilized, underwriters began to syndicate new
issues left over from 2007 deals. As the excess supply was reduced, underwriters
began

to add a few new deals in 2008, which were more attractively priced, better
structured and less leveraged than prior loans. However, despite easing
technical pressure and a better balance between supply and demand, corporate
fundamentals began to deteriorate during the period along with the weakening
economy. Largely as a result, amendment activity increased and loan default
rates rose, moving closer to historical averages. The Fund, however, did not
experience any bank loan defaults during the period.

Despite weakening corporate fundamentals and the uptick in loan defaults, the
loan market was relatively stable in August and early September, and secondary
loan prices were mostly range bound. However, in the final two weeks of
September, following Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy filing, the credit markets
experienced significant volatility. As a result, secondary loan prices plummeted
to a new all-time low, which was below the previously established low in
February of 2008. Secondary loan price activity is tracked by the Standard &
Poor's Leveraged Commentary and Data (LCD) flow names composite, which comprises
the 15 most active loans in the Standard & Poor's Loan Syndications and Trading
Association (LSTA) Leveraged Loan Index (LLI).(6)

Although we expected volatility to remain high in this difficult market
environment, we believed the volatility created many attractive long-term
opportunities as we found valuations historically attractive, with discounted
spreads at all-time highs and average bids at all-time lows.

During the review period, MBS generally outperformed the high yield corporate
bond and bank loan sectors. Although not immune from volatility and tightening
credit conditions, agency mortgages benefited somewhat from government
intervention, while privately issued MBS and asset-backed securities (ABS)
generally generated lower returns during the period. Agency MBS benefited from
the takeovers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as investor confidence was boosted
by the government's actions. In addition, the economic rescue plan enacted by
Congress in early October may help the MBS and ABS sectors.

During the period, we found opportunities in higher-coupon MBS as they became
less susceptible to early prepayments. We also found an opportunity to invest in
those sectors that experienced yield spread widening and were hampered by low
liquidity. For example, we found what we believed were attractive opportunities
in securitized sectors with strong credit fundamentals, specifically those
related to commercial real estate. At period-end, these investments were

experience principal losses on any of its subprime investments.

ENDNOTES

INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AND MORTGAGE PREPAYMENTS WILL AFFECT THE FUND'S SHARE
PRICE AND YIELD. THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER-YIELDING, LOWER-RATED
SECURITIES INCLUDE HIGHER RISK OF DEFAULT AND LOSS OF PRINCIPAL.

(1.) Figures are for common shares. As of 9/30/08, the Trust had leverage in the
     amount of 36.91% of the Trust's total assets. The Trust employs leverage
     through the issuance of Auction Preferred Shares and purchase of Mortgage
     Dollar Rolls. The use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for
     increased income but, at the same time, creates special risks (including
     the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of
     common shares). The cost of leverage rises and falls with changes in
     short-term interest rates. Such increases/decreases in the cost of the
     Trust's leverage may be offset by increased/decreased income from the
     Trust's floating rate investments.

(2.) Total return calculations represent the cumulative and average annual
     changes in value of an investment over the periods indicated. Six-month
     return has not been annualized.

(3.) Assumes reinvestment of distributions at net asset value.

(4.) Assumes reinvestment of distributions based on the dividend reinvestment
     plan.

(5.) Distribution rate is based on an annualization of the Fund's 7.6 cent per
     share September dividend and the AMEX closing price of $8.36 on 9/30/08.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan

The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (Plan) offers you a prompt and simple way
to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions (Distributions) in shares
of the Fund. PNC Global Investment Services (Agent), P.O. Box 6006, Carol
Stream, IL 60197-6006, will act as your Agent in administering the Plan. The
Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in the same name as your
outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and Conditions of the
Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained from the Fund at the
address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants should note that they will not
be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares at a specific time or at a
specific price. The Agent may make open-market purchases on any securities
exchange where shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.


                             12 | Semiannual Report

<PAGE>

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
the American Stock Exchange, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that
date, then the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange
on such date. The net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the
amount most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of
its employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants in the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve you of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made


                             Semiannual Report | 13

<PAGE>

for your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the
acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of the Fund, no certificates for a fractional
share will be issued. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to
your account. If you terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will
adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of
shares at the time of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at (800) 331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

Limited Duration Income Trust

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (Fund) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a diversified,
closed-end investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities, government securities, mortgage pass-through
securities, other mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
bond dealers, and information with respect to bond and note transactions, to
assist in determining a current market value for each security. The Fund's
pricing services may use valuation models or matrix pricing which considers
information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions, quotations
from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities that are considered
comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date,
option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and
yield curves, to determine current value.

Senior secured corporate loans with floating or variable interest rates
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
loan dealers and other financial institutions, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services use independent market quotations
from loan dealers or financial institutions and may incorporate valuation
methodologies that consider multiple bond characteristics such as dealer quotes,
issuer type, coupon, maturity, weighted average maturity, interest rate spreads
and yield curves, cash flow and credit risk/quality analysis, to determine
current value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

A. SECURITY VALUATION (CONTINUED)

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED, DELAYED DELIVERY AND TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery and
to-be-announced (TBA) basis, with payment and delivery scheduled for a future
date. These transactions are subject to market fluctuations and are subject to
the risk that the value at delivery may be more or less than the trade date
purchase price. Although the Fund will generally purchase these securities with
the intention of holding the securities, it may sell the securities before the
settlement date. Sufficient assets have been segregated for these securities.

D. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts, as measured by the difference between the
contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at the
reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

E. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund may enter into mortgage dollar rolls, typically on a TBA basis.
Mortgage dollar rolls are agreements between the fund and a financial
institution to simultaneously sell and repurchase mortgage-backed securities at
a future date. Gains or losses are realized on the initial sale, and the
difference between the repurchase price and the sale price is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss to the fund upon entering into the mortgage dollar roll.
In addition, the Fund may earn interest on the cash proceeds that are received
from the initial sale. During the period between the sale and repurchase, the
Fund is not entitled to principal and interest paid on the mortgage backed
securities. The risks of mortgage dollar roll transactions include the potential
inability of the counterparty to fulfill its obligations.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS (CONTINUED)

The Fund is investing in mortgage dollar rolls as an alternate form of leverage.
As a result, the mortgage dollar rolls are considered indebtedness or a "senior
security" for purposes of the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act.

F. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Senior secured corporate loans often
require prepayment of principal from excess cash flows or at the discretion of
the borrower. As a result, actual maturity may be substantially less than the
stated maturity.

Senior secured corporate loans in which the Fund invests are generally readily
marketable, but may be subject to some restrictions on resale.

G. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
dividend and interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based
on the tax regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the
Fund invests.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years and as of September 30, 2008, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements.

H. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
common shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined
according to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings
determined on a tax basis may differ from earnings recorded

in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent
differences are reclassified among capital accounts to reflect their tax
character. These reclassifications have no impact on net assets or the results
of operations. Temporary differences are not reclassified, as they may reverse
in subsequent periods.

I. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust's (Trust) organizational
documents, its officers and trustees are indemnified by the Trust against
certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters into contracts
with service providers that contain general indemnification clauses. The Trust's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.
Currently, the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At September 30, 2008, there were 28,290,000 common shares authorized (without
par value). During the period ended September 30, 2008, there were no shares
issued; all reinvested distributions were satisfied with previously issued
shares purchased in the open market. During the year ended March 31, 2008, there
were 34,261 shares issued for $490,071 from reinvested distributions.

3. AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

On November 7, 2003 the Fund issued 2,534 Preferred Shares Series M, 2,533
Preferred Shares Series W and 2,533 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference per share totaling $190,000,000. During the
period ended September 30, 2008, there was a pro rata

preferred redemption of each series totaling 4,000 shares and $100,000,000
leaving 1,200 Preferred Shares Series M, 1,200 Preferred Shares Series W and
1,200 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a $25,000 liquidation preference
totaling $90,000,000. Dividends to preferred shareholders are cumulative and are
declared weekly, at rates established through an auction process. During the
period ended September 30, 2008, the dividends on Preferred Shares ranged from
3.54% to 5.62%. The weekly auctions for Series M, W and F have failed since
February 13, 2008; consequently, the dividend rate paid on the preferred shares
has moved to the maximum rate as defined in the prospectus.

The Fund is required to maintain, on a weekly basis, a specified discounted
value of its portfolio in compliance with guidelines established by Fitch
Ratings and Moody's Investor Services Inc., and is required to maintain asset
coverage for the Preferred Shares of at least 200%.

The Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund at any time and are subject to
mandatory redemption if the asset coverage or discounted value requirements are
not met. During the period ended September 30, 2008, all requirements were met.

4. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Franklin Resources, Inc. is the holding company for various subsidiaries that
together are referred to as Franklin Templeton Investments. Certain officers and
trustees of the Fund are also officers and/or directors of the following
subsidiaries:

The Fund pays an investment management fee and administrative fee to Advisers
and FT Services of 0.50% and 0.20%, respectively, per year of the average daily
managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the Fund's gross asset value minus
the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the liquidation value of the
preferred shares and other financial leverage.

5. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the period ended September 30, 2008, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.

</TABLE>

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of defaulted securities, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, payments-in-kind, and bond
discounts and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, pay-down losses, and bond discounts and
premiums.

7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
period ended September 30, 2008, aggregated $486,139,125 and $487,270,752,
respectively.

8. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

10. CREDIT RISK AND DEFAULTED SECURITIES

The Fund has 61.69% of its portfolio invested in high yield, senior secured
floating rate notes, or other securities rated below investment grade. These
securities may be more sensitive to economic conditions causing greater price
volatility and are potentially subject to a greater risk of loss due to default
than higher rated securities.

The Fund held defaulted securities and/or other securities for which the income
has been deemed uncollectible. At September 30, 2008, the value of this security
was $390,000, representing 0.08% of the Fund's portfolio. The Fund discontinues
accruing income on securities for which income has been deemed uncollectible and
provides an estimate for losses on interest receivable. The securities have been
identified on the accompanying Statement of Investments.

11. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrowers' discretion. Funded portions of credit agreements are presented on the
Statement of Investments.

At September 30, 2008, unfunded commitments were as follows:

Unfunded loan commitments and funded portions of credit agreements are marked to

Assets and Liabilities and Statement of Operations.

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Fund adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157), on April 1, 2008. SFAS
157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and
expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Fund has determined that
the implementation of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Fund's
financial statements.

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (CONTINUED)

SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market
data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Fund's own
market assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining
the value of the Fund's investments and are summarized in the following fair
value hierarchy:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk,
          etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.

The following is a summary of the inputs used as of September 30, 2008, in
valuing the Fund's assets and liabilities carried at fair value:

     (depreciation) of futures, forward exchange contracts, swaps, and unfunded
     loan commitments.

13. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In March 2008, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133"
(SFAS 161), which expands disclosures about derivative investments and hedging
activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after November 15, 2008. The Fund is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of
applying the various provisions of SFAS 161.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of
another independent third party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy
directly to the Fund with a recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If
the conflict is not resolved by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter,
along with the recommended course of action by the manager to an
interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include portfolio managers
and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting
instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation
of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third party provider
of proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group
or the Proxy Review Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the
instructions of a representative of the Fund, such as the board of trustees or a
committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, or pursuant to
an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests uninvested cash in affiliated
money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive order ("cash sweep
arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's governing documents
or applicable law. Echo voting means that the investment manager will vote the
shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the other holders of the
Fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Shareholders may view the complete Policies online at franklintempleton.com.
Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the Policies free of charge by

the SEC website at WWW.SEC.GOV. The proxy voting records are updated each year
by August 31 to reflect the most recent 12-month period ended June 30.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised March 06, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.


II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.


III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
