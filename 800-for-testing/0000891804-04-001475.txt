BE IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCKS IN A WELL-BALANCED PORTFOLIO.



Dear
  SHAREHOLDER

I am very pleased to report that for the period ended April 30, 2004, your
Nuveen Fund continued to provide you with attractive monthly tax-free income.

While tax-free income is always welcome, we know that many shareholders are
beginning to wonder whether interest rates will rise significantly, and whether
that possibility should cause them to adjust that portion of their investment
portfolios allocated to tax-free municipal bonds. We believe this is a question
you should consider carefully with the help of a trusted financial advisor. In
many cases, it may be more appropriate to focus on long-term goals and
objectives rather than shorter-term market movements, and this is where a
professional advisor may be able to help keep you focused on the larger
objectives of your investment program.

As you read through this report, please review the inside front cover and
consider receiving future Fund reports and other Fund information by e-mail and
the Internet. Not only will you be able to receive the information faster, but
this also may help lower your Fund's expenses. Sign up is quick and easy.

Since 1898, Nuveen Investments has offered financial products and solutions that
incorporate careful research, diversification and the application of
conservative risk-management principles. We are grateful that you have chosen us
as a partner as you pursue your financial goals. We look forward to continuing
to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.


Sincerely,

/s/ Timothy R. Schwertfeger

Nuveen National Municipal Closed-End Exchange-Traded Funds (NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD,
NXZ, NZF)

Portfolio Manager's
               COMMENTS

Portfolio manager Tom Spalding reviews the market environment, key investment
strategies, and the six-month performance of the Funds. With 27 years of
investment experience at Nuveen, Tom has managed NXZ since its inception in
2001, adding NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, and NZF in 2003.



WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE 6-MONTH
REPORTING PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2004?

During this reporting period, the greatest influences on the national economy
and the municipal market continued to be historically low interest rates,
growing evidence of economic improvement, and a generally modest rate of
inflation. Since its last credit easing in June 2003, the Federal Reserve has
maintained the fed funds rate at 1.0%, the lowest level since 1958. This
accommodative monetary policy helped to spur GDP (gross domestic product) growth
of 4.4% annualized in the first quarter of 2004, following a 3.1% rise in 2003.
Over the six-month reporting period, the year-over-year rate of inflation, as
measured by the core Consumer Price Index, averaged 1.3%.

This generally favorable environment helped many municipal bonds perform well
during most of the six-month period ended April 30, 2004. However, in early
April, a sharply improved jobs report, along with subsequent indications of
growing momentum in the U.S. economy, served as catalysts for increased
expectations of a Fed rate hike. This all contributed to heightened volatility
in the fixed-income markets. During April, the yield on the Bond Buyer 25
Revenue Bond index, a widely-followed municipal market index, rose almost 40
basis points. The rise in the index yield, and corresponding decline in bond
prices, effectively offset the yield declines and price gains of the previous
five months. As of April 30, 2004, the Bond Buyer 25 index was at approximately
the same level as it was at the beginning of the six-month reporting period.

In general, municipal supply remained strong over the past six months, although
the pace of issuance slowed. The first four months of 2004 saw $110 billion in
new municipal supply, down 9% from January-April 2003. Over the entire six-month
reporting period ended April 2004, the supply of new bonds decreased 13%
compared with the preceding six months.

IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING
THE SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2004?

With the market continuing to anticipate an increase in interest rates, our
major focus during this reporting period remained on careful management of the
Funds' durations1 as a way to mitigate some of the interest rate risk inherent
in each


1    Duration is a measure of a Fund's net asset value (NAV) volatility in
     reaction to interest rate movements. Fund duration, also known as
     leverage-adjusted duration, takes into account the leveraging process for a
     Fund and therefore is generally longer than the duration of the actual
     portfolio of individual bonds that make up the Fund. References to duration
     in this commentary are intended to indicate Fund duration unless otherwise
     noted.


                                       2

Fund's portfolio. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a Fund's
portfolio will decline if market interest rates rise (since bond prices move in
the opposite direction of interest rates). The longer the duration of a Fund's
portfolio, the greater the Fund's interest rate risk. Our use of such a duration
management strategy is designed to position the Funds to potentially produce
more consistent returns over time, as interest rates inevitably rise and fall.

This focus on duration management did not result in a great deal of buying or
selling within any of these Funds' portfolios over the six-month period. With
yields remaining low over most of this period, the market did not offer many
bonds that we thought would perform better than those we already owned in our
portfolios. While that situation began to change in April as yields rose, we did
not see a great number of opportunities to improve the Funds' holdings during
this reporting period. In general, turnover in these Funds was low over the six
months ended April 30, 2004.

In keeping with our duration management strategy and the relative steepness of
the municipal bond yield curve over this period, those bonds we did purchase for
all of these Funds tended to be in the long-intermediate part of the yield curve
(i.e., bonds that mature in 15 to 20 years). In many cases, bonds in this part
of the curve offered yields similar to those of longer-term bonds with less
inherent interest rate risk. Overall, we looked for bonds that would help us
keep the Funds' portfolios well diversified in terms of industry sector,
maturity, and geographic region. Based on the recent implementation of economic
reforms and cost-cutting measures in California, we believe this state has
demonstrated signs of progress, and we took advantage of selected opportunities
to add California bonds across all of these Funds.

2    The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is an unleveraged, unmanaged
     national index comprising a broad range of investment-grade municipal
     bonds. Results for the Lehman index do not reflect any expenses.

3    The Lipper General (Leveraged) Municipal Debt Funds category average is
     calculated using the returns of all closed-end exchange-traded funds in
     this category for each period as follows: 6 months - 65 funds; 1 year - 64
     funds; 5 years - 49 funds; and 10 years - 46 funds. Fund and Lipper returns
     assume reinvestment of dividends.


                                       3

<PAGE>

For the six months ended April 30, 2004, the cumulative returns of all six of
the Funds in this report outperformed the return on the Lehman Brothers
Municipal Bond Index. NMA, NXZ and NZF also outperformed their Lipper peer group
average, while NPP, NMO and NAD did not.

The primary reason for all the Funds' outperformance of the Lehman Brothers
index over this period was the Funds' use of leverage. While leveraging can add
volatility to the Funds' net asset values (NAVs) and share prices, this strategy
also can provide opportunities for additional income and total return for common
shareholders during periods of low short-term interest rates, as was the case
during most of this six-month period.

In addition to leverage, the Funds benefited from their holdings of healthcare
bonds over this six-month period. Healthcare bonds generally performed well due
to improvements in cost containment and reimbursement practices which helped
their long-term outlook. In addition, their often higher coupons were in demand
during a period of generally low interest rates. Among the Funds, holdings of
healthcare bonds on April 30, 2004, ranged from 25% of NXZ's portfolio to 17% in
NMA and NZF, 15% in NAD, and 10% in both NPP and NMO.

NMA and NXZ also held approximately 1% of their assets (in terms of par value),
in bonds issued by the Michigan State Hospital Finance Authority for Detroit
Medical Center, the largest healthcare provider in southeast Michigan. As the
center's financial situation stabilized following implementation of cost-cutting
initiatives and improved operating efficiencies, the price of these bonds
rebounded, contributing to the favorable six-month returns of NMA and NXZ.

The six-month reporting period saw relatively strong performance from
lower-rated bonds. Among the lower-rated holdings making positive contributions
to these Funds' cumulative returns during this reporting period were tobacco
bonds backed by revenues from the 1998 master tobacco settlement agreement.
However, late in the reporting period Moody's downgraded all tobacco bonds that
were not enhanced or secured by an additional funding source. The other major
credit rating agencies--S&P and Fitch--did not change their ratings. In general,
we believed that the prices of tobacco bonds accurately reflected the risks
involved and that these bonds continued to represent good value.

Additional factors that impacted the Funds' performances over this semiannual
reporting period included:


                                       4

<PAGE>

o    The advance refunding of several holdings in NPP and NAD, which enhanced
     prices as well as quality and contributed to the Funds' returns.

o    Modest weightings in both single family and multifamily housing bonds,
     which lessened the impact of the poor performance of the housing sector, as
     measured by the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index, over this six-month
     period.

o    Generally low levels of call exposure, which benefited the Funds by
     enabling us to avoid reinvestment of proceeds from called bonds in a low
     interest rate environment. As of April 30, 2004, potential call exposure in
     2004 and 2005 ranged from 19% in NPP to 7% in NAD and NMA, 6% in NMO, 3% in
     NZF, and 2% in NXZ. The actual number of calls experienced by any of these
     Funds will depend on a variety of factors, including interest rate levels
     and the needs of the issuing entities.

The Funds' cumulative return performances relative to one another during this
period were influenced by the relative weightings of specific market sectors
within each portfolio, as well as the performance of individual securities over
this reporting period. For example, NPP's and NMO's performance compared with
the other Funds in this report was hampered by their relatively smaller holdings
of healthcare bonds, which generally performed well over the six months.
Additionally, some of NPP's single family housing bonds, some of NMO's general
obligation bonds and some of NAD's education bonds did not perform as well as
their overall sectors during this period.

HOW ABOUT THE FUNDS' DIVIDENDS AND SHARE PRICES?

With short-term interest rates remaining at historically low levels during this
reporting period, the leveraged structures of these six Funds continued to
support their dividend-paying capabilities. The extent of this benefit is tied
in part to the short-term rates the Funds pay their MuniPreferred(R)
shareholders. During periods of low short-term rates, the Funds generally pay
relatively lower dividends to their MuniPreferred shareholders, which can leave
more earnings to support common share dividends. During this reporting period,
continued low short-term rates enabled us to increase the dividend of NZF in
December 2003, while maintaining the dividend levels of NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, and
NXZ throughout the six-month period.

All of these Funds seek to pay stable dividends at rates that reflect each
Fund's past results and projected future performance. During certain periods,
each Fund may pay dividends at a rate


                                       5

<PAGE>

that may be more or less than the amount of net investment income actually
earned by the Fund during the period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more
than it has paid in dividends, it holds the excess in reserve as undistributed
net investment income (UNII) as part of the Fund's net asset value (NAV).
Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in excess of its earnings,
the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise reflected in the Fund's
NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net investment income as
dividends to shareholders. As of April 30, 2004, all six Funds in this report
had positive UNII balances.

As of April 30, 2004, NPP was trading at a discount of -11.15%, compared with an
average discount of -5.21% for the six-month period. NMA was trading at a
discount of -8.12%, compared with an average of -1.72%, NMO was at a -11.15%
discount compared with an average of -5.65%, NAD was at a discount of -6.94%,
compared with an average of -0.35%, NXZ was at a -6.24% discount, compared with
an average of -2.42%, and NZF was at a discount of -9.07% compared with an
average of -5.24% for the period.

HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AS OF APRIL 30, 2004?

Given the current geopolitical and economic climate, we continued to believe
that maintaining strong overall credit quality was an important requirement. As
of the end of April 2004, all six of these Funds continued to offer excellent
average credit quality, with allocations of bonds rated AAA/U.S. guaranteed and
AA ranging from 83% in NPP to 82% in NZF, 78% in NMO, 76% in NAD, 74% in NMA and
68% in NXZ.

                         was likely United would not remain current on their
                         interest payment obligations with respect to these
                         bonds and thus has stopped accruing interest.

                         variable rate and demand features which qualify it as a

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The National Funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding
Common share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund,
Inc. (NPP), Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market
Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD),
Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 3 (NZF). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA),
Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)
are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations
issued by state and local government authorities.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

Securities Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for municipal
securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based on yields
or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue, coupon,
maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers, evaluations
of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market conditions. If it is
determined that market prices for a security are unavailable or inappropriate,
the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee, may establish a
fair value for the security. Temporary investments in securities that have
variable rate and demand features qualifying them as short-term securities are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

Securities Transactions

Securities transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from such transactions are determined on the specific identification
method. Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis
may have extended settlement periods. The securities so purchased are subject to
market fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian
to segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At April 30, 2004,
Performance Plus (NPP)and Municipal Advantage (NMA) had outstanding when-issued
purchase commitments of $7,727,610 and $1,591,150, respectively. At April 30,
2004, there were no such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the other
Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

Professional Fees

Professional fees presented in the Statement of Operations consist of legal fees
incurred in the normal course of operations, audit fees, tax consulting fees
and, in some cases, workout expenditures. Workout expenditures are incurred in
an attempt to protect or enhance an investment, or to pursue other claims or
legal actions on behalf of the Fund's shareholders.

Federal Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to comply with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable
to regulated investment companies and to distribute all of its net investment
income to its shareholders. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is
required. Furthermore, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable
interest from municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income
tax, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of the
Funds.

                    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (continued)



Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Preferred Shares

The Funds have issued and outstanding $25,000 stated value Preferred shares.
Each Fund's Preferred shares are issued in more than one Series. The dividend
rate on each Series may change every seven days, as set pursuant to a dutch
auction process by the auction agent, and is payable at or near the end of each
rate period. The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total,
for each Fund is as follows:

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Funds may invest in certain derivative financial instruments including
futures, forward, swap and option contracts, and other financial instruments
with similar characteristics. Although the Funds are authorized to invest in
such financial instruments, and may do so in the future, they did not make any
such investments during the six months ended April 30, 2004.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, its Officers and Director/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

2. FUND SHARES

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to their officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates.

As approved by the Board of Directors/Trustees, a complex-wide fee schedule for
all Funds managed by the Adviser and its affiliates will go into effect on
August 1, 2004. This complex-wide fee schedule is expected to marginally
decrease the rate at which management fees are to be paid by the Funds. Under no
circumstances will the complex-wide fee schedule result in an increase in the
rate at which management fees would be paid by the Funds if the complex-wide fee
schedule were not implemented.

For the first ten years of Dividend Advantage's (NAD) operations, the Adviser
has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net assets
(including net assets attributable to Preferred shares), for fees and expenses
in the amounts and for the time periods set forth below:

Certain investments owned by the Funds are either covered by insurance issued by
several private insurers or are backed by an escrow or trust containing U.S.
Government or U.S. Government agency securities, both of which ensure the timely
payment of principal and interest in the event of default (63% for Performance
Plus (NPP), 55% for Municipal Advantage (NMA), 56% for Market Opportunity (NMO),
62% for Dividend Advantage (NAD), 53% for Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and 66% for
Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)). Such insurance or escrow, however, does not
guarantee the market value of the municipal securities or the value of the
Funds' shares.

For additional information regarding each investment security, refer to the
Portfolio of Investments of each Fund.

Sidebar text: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Exchange-Traded Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase price
per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid
in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage
commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These
commissions usually will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.

FLEXIBILITY

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

For more information on the Nuveen Automatic Reinvestment Plan or to enroll in
or withdraw from the Plan, speak with your financial advisor or call us at (800)
257-8787.

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A description of the policies and procedures that the Funds use to determine how
to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities is available (i) without
charge, upon request, by calling Nuveen Investments at (800) 257-8787; and (ii)
on the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

POLICY CHANGE

On February 25, 2004, the Board approved policies that would allow NXZ and NZF
at the discretion of the Adviser, to engage in certain types of derivative
transactions for the purpose of hedging interest rate risk. There is no
guarantee that the Adviser will cause a Fund to enter into such transactions. If
a Fund were to engage in hedging, there is no guarantee that such hedging will
be successful.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return (including change in NAV and reinvested dividends) that
would have been necessary on an annual basis to equal the investment's actual
performance over the time period being considered.

AVERAGE DURATION: Duration is a measure of a bond or bond fund's sensitivity to
changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond or fund's duration, the
more the price of the bond or fund will change as interest rates change.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of a bond or bond fund's
sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Generally, the longer a bond or fund's
duration, the more the price of the bond or fund will change as interest rates
change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for
a Fund and therefore is generally longer than the duration of the actual
portfolio of individual bonds that make up the Fund.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A fund's NAV is calculated by subtracting the liabilities
of the fund from its total assets and then dividing the remainder by the number
of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

- ----------
*Director/Trustee will be retiring on June 30, 2004.

Each Fund intends to repurchase shares of its own common or preferred stock,
where applicable, in the future at such times and in such amounts as is deemed
advisable. No shares were purchased during the six-months ended April 30, 2004.
Any future repurchases will be reported to shareholders in the next annual or
semiannual report.
