            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


To the Board of Directors and Members of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets, liabilities and members'
capital, including the schedule of investments, and the related statements of
operations, of changes in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial
highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Columbia Management Multi-Strategy Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund") at March 31,
2009, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended,
the changes in its members' capital for each of the two years in the period then
ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of investments at March
31,2009 by correspondence with the custodian and portfolio funds, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2 to the financial statements, the financial statements
include investments held by the Fund valued at $371,644,567 (82.33% of the
Fund's net assets) at March 31, 2009, the values of which have been fair valued
by the Adviser, under the general supervision of the Board of Directors, in the
absence of readily ascertainable market values.

(a) The aggregate cost of investments in Portfolio Funds for tax purposes was
approximately $437,034,619. Net unrealized depreciation on investments for tax
purposes was $65,390,052 consisting of $13,245,201 of gross unrealized
appreciation, and $78,635,253 of gross unrealized depreciation.

(b) The Portfolio Fund instituted a recapitalization plan by offering new
classes with extended lock-ups. On December 13, 2008 the Fund exchanged its
interest in Class R to Class A1, which provides annual liquidity. The next
available redemption date will be December 31, 2009.

(c) The Portfolio Fund is liquidating its assets and is in the process of
returning capital to its partners. Due to the liquidation, the Portfolio Fund
has suspended withdrawals. Cash distributions will be made to the partners on a
pro-rata basis as the Portfolio Fund's assets are liquidated.

(d) As a result of significant withdrawal requests for the December 31, 2008 and
March 31, 2009 redemption dates, the Portfolio Fund provided the withdrawing
investors with the option to receive their withdrawal requests as a
distribution-in-kind or as interests in a special purpose vehicle ("SPV"). The
Fund submitted a partial redemption request for the March 31, 2009 redemption
date and selected to receive its withdrawal proceeds as interests in an SPV.
$869,726 (approximately 60% of the Fund's redeeming non-side-pocketed capital)
has been transferred from the Portfolio Fund to the SPV as of April 1, 2009, and
is included in Redemptions receivable from investments in Portfolio Funds in
these financial statements.

(e) The Portfolio Fund transferred all of its assets held in a non-segregated
form (securities held in a non-cash account) at Lehman Brothers International
(53% of the Portfolio Fund's 9/30/08 NAV) into a reserve account. The funds held
in the reserve account are not available for redemption as of the date of this
report.

(f) The Portfolio Fund applied an additional 6% reserve holdback on the December
31, 2008 and future withdrawal dates for the investors in the Portfolio Fund as
of September 30, 2008 to provide for possible contingent liabilities related to
insolvency of Lehman Brothers Holdings and its affiliates.

(g) The Portfolio Fund invoked a restriction (gate) on the December 31, 2008
withdrawals and provided for redemptions up to the gate level of 15% of the
Portfolio Fund's net assets through a combination of cash disbursements and an
in-kind distribution. The Fund has not submitted any redemption requests to this
Portfolio Fund as of the date of this report.

(k) As a result of significant withdrawal requests, the Portfolio Fund

Fund's assets are liquidated.

(l) As a result of significant withdrawal requests, the Portfolio Fund suspended
withdrawals for the December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 redemption dates. The
Fund submitted a full redemption request to this Portfolio Fund for the December
31, 2008 redemption date. In April 2009, the Portfolio Fund lifted the
suspension and announced that May 1, 2009 will be the redemption day for
purposes of meeting pending redemption requests. As a result of the suspension
lift, the Fund received its full redemption proceeds on May 13, 2009.

(m) The Portfolio Fund has restricted redemption rights by transferring the
instruments with an illiquid profile into a side pocket as of December 31, 2008.
As of the date of this report, approximately 49% of the Fund's investment in the
Portfolio Fund remains in the side pocket.

(n) The Portfolio Fund invoked a restriction (gate) on the June 30, 2008,
September 30, 2008, December 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 withdrawals and
provided for redemptions up to the gate level of 10% of the Portfolio Fund's net
assets through cash distributions.

(o) As a result of significant withdrawal requests, the Portfolio Fund created a
liquidating trust for the partners who requested a March 31, 2009 withdrawal.
The liquidation trust was to provide for an orderly liquidation of its assets.
The Fund has not submitted any redemption requests to this Portfolio Fund as of
the date of this report.

The Fund's investments in Portfolio Funds may be subject to limitations on
redemptions, including the assessment of early redemption fees.

The below ratios are calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses as applicable by the average of total
monthly members' capital. Total return amounts are calculated by geometrically linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from these returns based on the timing of
capital contributions and withdrawals.

1.  ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC (the "Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended,  (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end management investment company and
is  operating  as a  diversified  investment  company.  The Fund has many of the
features of a private  investment fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests")  are
offered  only in  private  placements  to persons  (i) who are both  "accredited
investors" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and "qualified  clients"
under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and
(ii) who meet other investor  eligibility  criteria established by the Fund. The
primary  investment  objectives  of the Fund  are to  provide  investors  (i) an
attractive,  long-term rate of return, on an absolute as well as a risk-adjusted
basis,  (ii) low performance  volatility and (iii) minimal  correlation with the
equity  and  fixed  income   markets.   The  Fund   employs  a   multi-strategy,
multi-manager  investment  strategy  premised  on the risk  control  benefits of
diversification  and the value of a hedged investment  approach.  The Fund seeks
diversification by investing in partnerships and other investment  vehicles (the
"Portfolio  Funds") that (i) pursue  non-traditional  investment  strategies and
(ii) are expected to exhibit a low degree of performance  correlation,  not only
with broad market indices but also with each other.  These  Portfolio  Funds are
managed by selected investment managers  ("Investment  Managers") who specialize
in the  chosen  strategies.  As of  March  31,  2009,  the Fund  invested  in 52
Portfolio Funds. There can be no assurance that the investment  objective of the
Fund will be achieved.

Banc of America  Investment  Advisors,  Inc. (the  "Adviser") is the  investment
adviser to the Fund.  The Adviser is registered  as an investment  adviser under
the Advisers Act. The Adviser is an indirect wholly-owned  subsidiary of Bank of
America  Corporation   ("BAC").  The  Adviser  has  retained  Grosvenor  Capital
Management,  L.P.  ("Grosvenor" or the  "Subadviser") as subadviser to the Fund.
The Adviser and the  Subadviser  have been  designated  as special  members (the
"Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.  USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The Fund's  investments are valued by the Adviser as of the close of business on
the last business day of each month in accordance  with policies and  procedures
approved by the Board. The Fund's  investments in Portfolio Funds may be subject
to limitations  on  redemptions,  including the  assessment of early  redemption
fees. In addition,  market quotations for such interests are not available. As a
result,  the Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds are valued at fair value,
which  normally  will be the  value  determined  by the  Portfolio  managers  or
administrators of the Portfolio Funds, subject to a determination by the Adviser
that such value  represents the fair value of the investment.  Such value of the
Fund's   interest  in  a  Portfolio   Fund   generally   represents  the  Fund's
proportionate  share of the net assets of the Portfolio  Fund.  The value of the
Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds is generally  increased by  additional
contributions  to the Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from
the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by  withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net
losses from the Portfolio  Funds.  The Fund, the Adviser and the Subadviser rely
upon  audited  and  unaudited  reports  and  estimates  prepared  by or for  the
Portfolio  Fund  and any  other  information  that  they  may  receive  from the
Portfolio Fund,  which may be subject to adjustment by the Portfolio Fund or its
manager or  administrator.  The values  assigned  to the Fund's  investments  in
Portfolio Funds may not represent amounts that would ultimately be realized,  as
such amounts depend on future  circumstances  and cannot be determined until the
liquidation of the Fund's  interest in a Portfolio  Fund. The estimated value of
the Fund's interests in Portfolio Funds may differ  significantly from the value
received upon liquidation.  The Fund, the Adviser and the Subadviser will not be
able to confirm  independently  the accuracy of the  valuations  provided by the
Portfolio Funds or their managers or administrators.

Portfolio  Funds,  or  their  managers  or   administrator,   generally  use  an
independent  pricing source to value the funds'  securities.  Securities with no
readily  available  market value are initially  valued at cost,  with subsequent
adjustments to values, which reflect either meaningful third-party  transactions
in the private market, or fair value deemed appropriate by the Portfolio Fund or
its manager or administrator. In such instances,  consideration will be given to
the financial condition and operating results of the issuer, the amount that the
Portfolio  Funds  would  reasonably  expect  to  realize  upon  the  sale of the
securities  and other  factors  deemed  relevant by the  Portfolio  Funds or its
manager or administrator.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

Some of the  Portfolio  Funds may  invest  all or a portion  of their  assets in
illiquid  securities  and  may  hold  all  or a  portion  of  these  investments
separately from the rest of their portfolio.  These separate baskets of illiquid
securities  (the "side  pockets") may be subject to  restrictions on liquidation
that  are  stricter  than  the  liquidity  restrictions  applicable  to  general
interests in the Portfolio Fund. If the Fund liquidates its interest from such a
Portfolio  Fund, it may be required to maintain the side pocket  investments for
an extended  period of time and retain its interests in the  Portfolio  Fund. In
instances,  where such a  Portfolio  Fund  closes its  operations,  the Fund may
receive  an 'in kind'  distribution  and fully  remove  its  interests  from the
Portfolio Fund. The value of the side pockets may fluctuate significantly. As of
March 31, 2009, the Fund's investments in side pockets  represented 3.19% of the
Fund's net assets.

In general,  most of the Portfolio  Funds in which the Fund invests  provide for
periodic withdrawals of capital ranging from monthly to bi-annually and, in some
cases, have lock up provisions under which the Fund may not withdraw capital for
a specified period after the date of its contribution,  which may be up to three
years.  The governing  documents of Portfolio Funds  generally  provide that the
Portfolio Fund may suspend,  limit or delay the right of its investors,  such as
the Fund, to withdraw capital.

C.  INVESTMENTS

The Fund's  investments  are reported at fair value in accordance with SFAS 157,
which is defined  below.  The Board and the  Valuation  Committee  have approved
procedures  pursuant to which the Fund values its investment in Portfolio  Funds
subject to the review and supervision of the Board and Valuation  Committee.  In
accordance  with these  procedures,  fair value of  investments in the Portfolio
Funds takes into consideration all available  information and other factors that
the Board and Valuation  Committee  deems  pertinent.  Generally,  the Board and
Valuation  Committee will use valuations reported to the Fund by the managers of
these Portfolio Funds as an input,  and the Fund,  Board or Valuation  Committee
may  reasonably  determine  that  additional  factors  should be considered  and
reflected.  The value of the  Fund's  investments  determined  using the  Fund's
procedures may differ from the value reported by the Portfolio Fund.  Because of
the inherent  uncertainty of valuations,  however,  estimated  values may differ
significantly  from the values that would have been used had a ready  market for
the investments existed, and the differences could be material.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C.  INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

In September 2006, the Financial  Accounting  Financial Standards Board ("FASB")
released  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  157,  Fair Value
Measurements ("SFAS 157"), which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value
to measure  assets and  liabilities.  The Fund  adopted SFAS No. 157 on April 1,
2008. SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation  techniques used to measure fair value.  The objective of a fair value
measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly   transaction  between  market
participants  at the  measurement  date (an exit price).  Accordingly,  the fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for  identical  assets or  liabilities  (level 1  measurements)  and the
lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements).  The three levels
of the fair value hierarchy under SFAS 157 are as follows:

    o    Level 1 -- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical,
         unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to
         access at the measurement date;
    o    Level 2 -- Quoted prices which are not considered to be active, or
         inputs that are observable (either directly or indirectly) for
         substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and
    o    Level 3 -- Prices, inputs or modeling techniques which are both
         significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
         by little or no market activity).

Inputs broadly refer to the  assumptions  that market  participants  use to make
valuation  decisions,  including  assumptions  about risk. The Adviser generally
uses the  value  reported  by the  Portfolio  Fund as the  primary  input to its
valuation;  however  adjustments  to the  reported  value  may be made  based on
various factors,  including,  but not limited to, the attributes of the interest
held, including the rights and obligations,  and any restrictions or illiquidity
on such  interests,  and the fair value of the fund's  investment  portfolio  or
other assets and liabilities.

An  individual  fund's  level  within the fair value  hierarchy  is based on the
lowest  level of any input that is  significant  to the fair value  measurement.
However, the determination of what constitutes "observable" requires significant
judgment by the Adviser. The Adviser considers observable data to be that market
data which is readily available,  regularly distributed or updated, reliable and
verifiable, not proprietary,  provided by multiple, independent sources that are
actively  involved in the relevant market.  The  categorization of a fund within
the hierarchy is based upon the pricing  transparency  of that fund and does not
necessarily correspond to the Adviser's perceived risk of that fund.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C.  INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)

Substantially  all of the  Fund's  investments  in  Portfolio  Funds  have  been
classified  within level 3, and the Fund generally does not hold any investments
that could be classified  as level 1 or level 2, as  observable  prices for such
investments are typically not available.  Assumptions used by the Fund, Board or
Valuation  Committee  due to the lack of  observable  inputs  may  significantly
impact  the  resulting  fair  value  and,  therefore,   the  Fund's  results  of
operations.

The following table sets forth information about the level within the fair value
hierarchy  at which the  Portfolio  Fund  investments  are measured at March 31,
2009:

In addition to the table  above,  included in cash and cash  equivalents  on the
Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital, are overnight deposits in
money market mutual funds and a PNC money market  account,  which are classified
as a Level 1 asset.

The  following  table  includes a roll forward of the amounts for the year ended
March 31, 2009 for the investments classified within Level 3. The classification
of an investment within Level 3 is based on the significance of the unobservable
inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D.  SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Purchases of investments in Portfolio  Funds are recorded as of the first day of
legal ownership of a Portfolio Fund and sales of Portfolio Funds are recorded as
of the last day of legal  ownership  or  participation.  Purchases  and sales of
other securities are accounted for on the trade-date  basis.  Realized gains and
losses are recorded at the time of disposition  of the respective  investment on
an average cost basis.

E.  INCOME RECOGNITION

Investment income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains
and losses are calculated on the average cost basis.

F.  INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Members")  are  individually  required to report on their own tax return  their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

Effective  April 1, 2007,  the Fund adopted the Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board ("FASB") FASB  Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes ("FIN 48").  FIN 48 provides  guidance  for how  uncertain  tax  positions
should  be  recognized,  measured,  presented  and  disclosed  in the  financial
statements. FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to
be taken in the course of preparing the Fund's tax returns to determine  whether
the  tax  positions  are   "more-likely-than-not"  of  being  sustained  by  the
applicable   tax   authority.   Tax   positions   not   deemed   to   meet   the
"more-likely-than-not"  threshold  would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense
in the current year.  The Fund has evaluated the  application  of FIN 48 and has
determined  that it does not have a  material  impact  on the  Fund's  financial
statements.  There is no tax liability  resulting from unrecognized tax benefits
relating to uncertain  income tax positions taken or expected to be taken on the
tax  return  for the year  ended  March 31,  2009.  No income  tax  returns  are
currently  under  examination.  The  statute of  limitations  on the Fund's U.S.
Federal tax returns  generally  remains open for returns  covering  fiscal years
ended on or after March 31, 2005. The statute of limitations on the Fund's state
and local tax returns may remain open for an additional  year depending upon the
jurisdiction.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

G.  CASH

Cash represents cash and cash equivalents held at PFPC Trust Company, the Fund's
custodian,  and includes  overnight  deposits in money market mutual  funds.  At
March 31, 2009, a total of  $70,007,142  in cash was held at the  custodian.  Of
that  amount,  $1,417,916  was  held  in a  segregated  account  related  to the
holdbacks on Members' withdrawals from the Fund.

H.  FUTURES

The Fund's use of futures is primarily for tactical  hedging  purposes.  Initial
margin  deposits of cash and  securities  are made upon  entering  into  futures
contracts.  The contracts are marked to market monthly and the resulting changes
in value are  accounted  for as unrealized  gains and losses.  Variation  margin
payments are paid or received, depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses
are incurred.  When the contract is closed,  the Fund records a realized gain or
loss equal to the difference  between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing
transaction and the amount invested in the contract.

Risks of entering into futures contracts include the possibility that there will
be an  imperfect  price  correlation  between  the  futures  and the  underlying
securities.  Second,  it is  possible  that  a lack  of  liquidity  for  futures
contracts  could exist in the  secondary  market,  resulting  in an inability to
close a  position  prior to its  maturity  date.  Third,  the  futures  contract
involves  risk that the Fund could lose more than the  original  margin  deposit
required to initiate a futures  transaction.  The risk exists that losses  could
exceed  amounts  disclosed on the schedule of investments or statement of assets
and liabilities.  For the year ended March 31, 2009, the Fund did not enter into
any futures contracts.

I.  OPTIONS CONTRACTS

An option gives the owner the right,  but not the  obligation,  to buy or sell a
specified  item at a fixed price during a specified  period for a  nonrefundable
fee (the  "premium").  The  maximum  loss to the buyer is limited to the premium
originally  paid.  The  premiums  paid for the  purchase  of these  options  are
included in the  statement of assets,  liabilities  and  members'  capital as an
investment  and  subsequently  marked-to-market  to  reflect  the  value  of the
options, with unrealized appreciation and depreciation included in the statement
of operations.

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

I.  OPTIONS CONTRACTS (CONTINUED)

As a writer  of  options,  the Fund  receives  a  premium  and bears the risk of
unfavorable  changes  in the  prices  of the  securities  or  index  instruments
underlying  the  options.  Premiums  received  from writing put and call options
which have not expired are presented in the liabilities section of the statement
of assets,  liabilities and members'  capital and  subsequently  adjusted to the
current  market  value of the options  written,  but not less than zero.  If the
current  market value of an option exceeds the premium  received,  the excess is
recorded as an  unrealized  loss and,  conversely,  if the  premium  exceeds the
current market value, the excess, to the extent of premium received, is recorded
as an  unrealized  gain.  The risk  exists  that  losses  could  exceed  amounts
disclosed on the schedule of investments or statement of assets and liabilities.
For the year  ended  March  31,  2009,  the Fund did not  purchase  or write any
options contracts.

3.  MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital  accounts of all Members,  in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  Members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period,  before giving effect to any distributions
and repurchases of Interests (or portions  thereof) by the Fund as of the end of
such period and any capital  contributions  made at the end of such period (such
capital contributions being deemed to be made as of the next day).

The Board, from time to time and in its complete and exclusive  discretion,  may
determine to repurchase Interests from Members,  including the Adviser, pursuant
to written  tenders by  Members  on such terms and  conditions  as the Board may
determine.  The Board offered to repurchase  Interests  from Members at June 30,
2008 and December 31, 2008. The Interests  redeemed pursuant to such tenders are
shown in the Statements of Changes in Members Capital.

Initial and  additional  applications  for Interests by eligible  Members may be
accepted at such times as the Adviser may determine. The Fund reserves the right
to reject  any  application  for  Interest  in the  Fund.  Moneys  accepted  for
investment in the Fund are held in escrow, by PNC Global  Investment  Servicing,
Inc.  ("PNC"),  formerly  known as  PFPC,  Inc.,  and  deposited  in a  separate
non-interest  bearing  account  pending the next closing date. The moneys in the
escrow account are invested in the Fund on that closing date.

3.  MEMBERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

Effective  September  1, 2008,  Interests  of the Fund placed by Banc of America
Investment  Services,  Inc.  are subject to a sales load (the  "Sales  Load") of
1.25% of the investment  amount on investments of less than $500,000.  The Sales
Load is applicable only to investors who make their first investment in the Fund
on or after  October  1,  2008.  The  Sales  Load may be  waived by the Fund for
certain types of  investors.  There was no Sales Load charged for the year ended
March 31, 2009.

4.  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees up
to 3% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations of
up to 20% of net profits  earned.  The  Portfolio  Funds  generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to two years from initial  investment.  Most of the Portfolio  Funds have the
contractual discretion to restrict or temporarily suspend redemptions in certain
circumstances.  Some Portfolio Funds may charge redemption fees. Such provisions
may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to changing market  conditions.  None
of the  Portfolio  Funds are  expected  to make  distributions  (e.g.,  dividend
payments to investors).

For the year ended March 31, 2009,  aggregate  purchases  and sales of Portfolio
Funds amounted to $259,517,852 and $64,460,191, respectively.

5.  CAPITAL COMMITMENTS OF THE FUND TO PORTFOLIO FUNDS

As of March  31,  2009,  the  Fund  had an  unfunded  investment  commitment  to
Blackstone Real Estate Special Situations Fund, LP, in the amount of $1,530,091.

6.  MANAGEMENT FEE

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  Members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and  Subadviser,  the Adviser pays 45% of the management fee
that it  receives  from  the  Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser  is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


7.  INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

An incentive  allocation is  calculated  with respect to each Member on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Member's Interest starts  immediately  following the preceding  Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year;  (ii) the next  repurchase of all or any portion of such Member's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund) allocated to each Member's  capital account for
such  Incentive  Period  over (b) the  greater of (i) the  Member's  Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the  balance  in the  Member's  Loss
Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive Period.

A Member's "Loss  Carryforward" for the initial Incentive Period is zero and for
each Incentive Period  thereafter is equal to the Member's Loss  Carryforward as
of  the  end  of  the  immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased  or
decreased,  but not below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between
the net  losses  over  net  profits  allocated  to the  Member  for the  current
Incentive Period.  The "Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return a Member would receive
if  its  Interest  as of  the  beginning  of  that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted
appropriately for any additional contributions) earned a rate of return equal to
the one-year U.S. Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar
quarter  and reset on the first day of each  calendar  quarter.  The Hurdle Rate
Amount is not cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive Period. The one-year
U.S.  Treasury note rates for June 30, 2008,  September  30, 2008,  December 31,
2008, and March 31, 2009 were 1.664%,  2.344%,  1.7098%,  and 0.3441% per annum,
respectively.  On June 30, 2008 and  December  31,  2008 there was no  incentive
allocation realized. Additional capital of $1,982 would have been reallocable to
the Special Members had the Members' measurement period for incentive allocation
closed on March 31, 2009.

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business  day of the  calendar  year,  the Member is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Member during the Incentive  Period prior to such  repurchase,  and the Member's
opening  capital  account  balance and Loss  Carryforward as of the beginning of
such Incentive Period, will be allocated between the two Interests in proportion
to the portion of the Member's Interest that is repurchased.

8.  ADMINISTRATION AND REGULATORY ADMINISTRATION FEES

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services for the Fund. PNC
serves as  administrator  and accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity
provides certain  accounting,  record keeping,  investor related  services,  and
regulatory administrative services. The Fund pays a monthly fee to the custodian
and the administrator  based primarily upon month-end Members' capital,  subject
to a monthly minimum fee.

9.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Each Board member who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by
the 1940 Act,  (the  "Independent  Directors"),  receives an annual  retainer of
$6,000 plus a fee of $1,000 for each meeting  attended.  Any Board member who is
an  "interested  person"  does not receive any annual fee or other fees from the
Fund.  Board  members are  reimbursed by the Fund for  reasonable  out-of-pocket
expenses.

The affiliates of the Adviser may have banking, underwriting, lending, brokerage
or other  business  relationships  with the  Portfolio  Funds in which  the Fund
invests and with the companies in which the Portfolio Funds invest.

Effective April 1, 2005, the Adviser provides a Chief Compliance  Officer to the
Fund at no cost to the Fund.

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
    CREDIT RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
invested in such limited partnerships,  limited liability companies, options and
futures contracts.

Because the Fund is a  closed-end  investment  company,  its  Interests  are not
redeemable  at the option of Members and are not  exchangeable  for interests of
any other fund. Although the Board in its discretion may cause the Fund to offer
from time to time to repurchase Interests at the members' capital account value,
the Interests are considerably  less liquid than shares of funds that trade on a
stock exchange or shares of open-end investment  companies.  With respect to any
tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase amount will be
determined  by the  Board in its  discretion  and  such  repurchase  amount  may
represent only a small portion of the

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
    CREDIT RISK OR LIQUIDITY RISKS (CONTINUED)

Fund's outstanding Interests.  Because the Fund's investments in Portfolio Funds
themselves have limited liquidity,  the Fund may not be able to fund significant
repurchases.

Members whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase also bear the risk that the
Fund's members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they
submit their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

Some Portfolio Funds have suspended or restricted  redemptions,  which increases
the liquidity  risk for the Fund.  Liquidity risk is the risk that the Fund will
encounter   difficulty  in  meeting   obligations   associated   with  financial
liabilities.  Among other things  liquidity could be impaired by an inability to
access  secured  and/or  unsecured  sources of  financing,  an inability to sell
assets  or  unforeseen  outflows  of  cash.  This  situation  may  arise  due to
circumstances outside of the Fund's control, such as a general market disruption
or an operational problem affecting the Fund or third parties. Also, the ability
to sell assets may be impaired if other market  participants are seeking to sell
similar assets at the same time.

The Fund's investments in Portfolio Funds can be redeemed on a limited basis. As
a result,  the Fund may not be able to liquidate quickly some of its investments
in the Portfolio Funds in order to meet liquidity requirements, or to respond to
specific events such as deterioration in the  creditworthiness  of any Portfolio
Fund.

11. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be remote.

12. LITIGATION EVENT

The events described below have not directly  impacted the Fund or had any known
material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)


12. LITIGATION EVENT (CONTINUED)

On February 9, 2005,  certain  affiliates  of the Adviser,  including the former
investment adviser to the Fund,  entered into Assurances of Discontinuance  with
the New York Attorney General ("NYAG") (the "NYAG Settlements") and consented to
the entry of  cease-and-desist  orders by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") (the "SEC  Orders") in  connection  with matters  relating to mutual
fund  trading.  Copies of the SEC Orders  are  available  on the SEC  website at
http://www.sec.gov.  Copies of the NYAG Settlements are available as part of the
Bank of America Corporation Form 8-K filing of February 10, 2005.

In  connection  with the events that  resulted in the NYAG  Settlements  and SEC
Orders,  various  parties filed suit against certain  Columbia Funds  (including
former Nations Funds), the Trustees of the Columbia Funds (including Trustees of
the former Nations Funds),  FleetBoston Financial Corporation (the former parent
of the Adviser) and certain of its  affiliated  entities  and/or Bank of America
Corporation  and  certain  of its  affiliated  entities.  More  than 300  cases,
including  those filed against  entities  unaffiliated  with the Columbia Funds,
their Boards,  FleetBoston  Financial  Corporation  and its affiliated  entities
and/or Bank of America Corporation and its affiliated entities, were transferred
to a  multi-district  proceeding in the Federal  District  Court in Maryland for
consolidated  or  coordinated  pretrial  proceedings.  The parties  have reached
settlements  with respect to the claims in the actions  concerning  the Columbia
Funds. All such settlements are subject to court approval.

13. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Subsequent to March 31, 2009, the Fund received additional capital contributions
of $5,225,000.

On  March  27,  2009,  the Fund  announced  a tender  offer  to  purchase  up to
$50,000,000 of outstanding  Interests from Members  effective June 30, 2009. The
offer expired at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Time, on April 23, 2009.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

FASB Staff Position (FSP) FAS 157-4  "Determining Fair Value When the Volume and
Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability  Have  Significantly  Decreased and
Identifying  Transactions  That Are Not  Orderly",  was  issued  April  9,  2009
effective for interim and annual  reporting  periods ending after June 15, 2009,
which is applied  prospectively.  FSP FAS 157-4 provides  additional guidance in
order to estimate  fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset
or  liability  has  significantly  decreased.  FSP  FAS  157-4  also  identifies
conditions to consider when  assessing  when a transaction  is not orderly.  FSP
157-4  amends FAS 157 to require  entities  to disclose  additional  information
regarding  the inputs and  valuation  techniques  used to measure fair value and
require entities to provide  disclosures for major categories of securities in a
more  disaggregated  basis than  previously had been required under FAS 157. The
Fund  is  reviewing  the  position  along  with  its  impact  on  the  financial
statements.

  (e)(1) Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
         ----------------------------------------------------

         The  registrant's  Audit  Committee  is  required  to  pre-approve  the
         engagement of the registrant's independent accountants to provide audit
         and  permissible  non-audit  services to the  registrant  and non-audit
         services to its investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
         role is primarily  portfolio  management and is  subcontracted  with or
         overseen  by another  investment  adviser)  or any entity  controlling,
         controlled by or under common control with such investment adviser that
         provides ongoing services to the registrant ("Adviser Affiliates"),  if
         the  engagement   relates  directly  to  the  operations  or  financial
         reporting of the registrant.

             The  Audit  Committee  has  adopted  a  Policy  for  Engagement  of
         Independent  Accountants for Audit and Non-Audit  Services  ("Policy").
         The  Policy  sets  forth  the  understanding  of  the  Audit  Committee
         regarding the engagement of the registrant's independent accountants to
         provide (i) audit

<PAGE>

         and permissible audit-related, tax and other services to the registrant
         (collectively   "Fund  Services");   (ii)  non-audit  services  to  the
         registrant's  investment  adviser (not including any sub-adviser  whose
         role is primarily  portfolio  management and is  subcontracted  with or
         overseen by another investment adviser) and Adviser Affiliates,  if the
         engagement relates directly to the operations or financial reporting of
         the registrant  (collectively  "Fund-related  Adviser  Services");  and
         (iii) certain other audit and  non-audit  services to the  registrant's
         investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment  adviser) and Adviser  Affiliates.  Unless a type of
         service receives  general  pre-approval  under the Policy,  it requires
         specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by
         the independent accountants.  Pre-approval of non-audit services to the
         registrant,  the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including any
         sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily  portfolio  management  and  is
         subcontracted  with or  overseen  by another  investment  adviser)  and
         Adviser  Affiliates  may be  waived  provided  that  the  "de  minimis"
         requirements  set forth under  paragraph  (c)(7)(i)(C)  of Rule 2-01 of
         Regulation S-X are met.

             Under the Policy,  the Audit  Committee  may delegate  pre-approval
         authority to any  pre-designated  member or members who are independent
         directors.  The  member(s) to whom such  authority  is  delegated  must
         report, for informational  purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to
         the Audit Committee at its next regular meeting.  The Audit Committee's
         responsibilities with respect to the pre-approval of services performed
         by the independent accountants may not be delegated to management.

             The Policy  requires  the Fund  Treasurer or his or her designee to
         submit to the Audit  Committee,  on an annual basis,  a schedule of the
         types of  services  that  are  subject  to  general  pre-approval.  The
         schedule(s)  provide  a  description  of each type of  service  that is
         subject to general  pre-approval  and,  where  possible,  will  provide
         estimated  fee caps for each instance of providing  each  service.  The
         Audit  Committee  will review and  approve  the types of  services  and
         review the  projected  fees for the next fiscal year and may add to, or
         subtract from, the list of general  pre-approved  services from time to
         time based on subsequent  determinations.  That  approval  acknowledges
         that the Audit  Committee  is in agreement  with the specific  types of
         services that the independent accountants will be permitted to perform.
         The Fund  Treasurer or his or her designee  must update the fee amounts
         to the extent necessary at each of the regularly  scheduled meetings of
         the Audit Committee.

  (e)(2) The  percentage of services  described in paragraphs (b) through (d) of
         this  Item  approved  pursuant  to  the  "deminimis"   exception  under
         paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X during the fiscal
         years ended March 31, 2008 and March 31, 2009 was zero.

     (f) Not applicable.

     (g) During  the  fiscal  years  ended  March 31,  2008 and March 31,  2009,
         respectively,  aggregate non-audit fees of approximately $71.60 Million
         and $98.80 Million were billed by the registrant's principal accountant
         to the  registrant's  investment  adviser (not  including a sub-adviser
         whose role is primarily  portfolio  management and is sub-contracted or
         overseen by another  investment  adviser)  and any entity  controlling,
         controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that
         provides ongoing services to the registrant.

     (h) The registrant's  audit committee  considered  whether the provision of
         non-audit services rendered to the registrant's investment adviser (not
         including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio  management
         and is subcontracted with or overseen by another  investment  adviser),
         and

<PAGE>

         any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not pre-approved is compatible with maintaining the principal
         accountant's independence.



ITEM 5.  AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Not applicable.



ITEM 6.  INVESTMENTS.

(a)  Schedule of  Investments  in securities of  unaffiliated  issuers as of the
     close  of the  reporting  period  is  included  as  part of the  report  to
     shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

(b)  Not applicable.



ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant has delegated to Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Gosvenor"),
the  sub-adviser,  the  responsibility  to vote  proxies  related  to  portfolio
securities.


Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, requires an
SEC-registered  investment  adviser  like  Grosvenor  Capital  Management,  L.P.
("GROSVENOR")  to implement  proxy voting  policies  and  procedures  reasonably
designed  to ensure  that  they  vote  proxies  in the best  interests  of their
clients.  Pursuant to that rule, Grosvenor has adopted Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures  (the  "Proxy  Policies")  that have  been  designed  to ensure  that
Grosvenor  votes  proxies  in  the  best  interests  of the  various  investment
management   accounts  that  Grosvenor   manages  (each,  a   "GROSVENOR-MANAGED
ACCOUNT").


WHEN GROSVENOR IS REQUESTED TO RESPOND TO PROXY REQUESTS


Each Grosvenor-Managed  Account is either: (i) a "fund of funds" that invests in
underlying  investment funds ("Portfolio Funds") but does not invest directly in
securities of operating companies,  except on a limited basis or (ii) a "feeder"
fund that invests in such a "fund of funds."


As a result, the most common scenario in which Grosvenor is requested to respond
to proxy requests  relating to securities held by one or more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts is where Grosvenor is requested to vote limited partnership  interests,
limited  liability  company  interests,  shares or similar  equity  interests in
Portfolio Funds in which one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts invest. In rare
cases,  Grosvenor  is requested to vote on matters  relating to  investments  in
operating companies.


For  purposes  of  convenience,  each  request  to  vote a  security  held  by a
Grosvenor-Managed Account is referred to as a "PROXY REQUEST."


MATERIAL PROPOSALS AND IMMATERIAL PROPOSALS


Grosvenor divides Proxy Requests into two general categories,  those relating to
"Immaterial Proposals" and those relating to "Material Proposals."

<PAGE>

An  "IMMATERIAL  PROPOSAL"  is a proposal  that,  if adopted,  WOULD NOT, in the
reasonable judgment of the relevant Grosvenor Compliance Officer, either: (a) be
reasonably   likely  to  have  a  material   adverse   effect  on  the  relevant
Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)  (E.G., a proposal to approve a change in the name
of a Portfolio  Fund,  to approve a Portfolio  Fund's  previous  year's  audited
financial  statements,  to approve a Portfolio Fund's appointment of independent
auditors,  to elect new directors of a Portfolio Fund,  ETC.); or (b) materially
adversely  change the terms on which  future  investments  may be made by one or
more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  In other words, a proposal that, if adopted,
would  change  any one or more  terms  in a  manner  that is  favorable,  or not
materially  adverse,  to  existing  or  future  investors,   is  an  "Immaterial
Proposal."


A "MATERIAL  PROPOSAL" is a proposal that is not an Immaterial Proposal (I.E., a
Material  Proposal is a proposal  that,  if adopted,  WOULD,  in the  reasonable
judgment of such Compliance Officer,  either: (a) be reasonably likely to have a
material  adverse effect on the relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s);  or (b)
materially adversely change the terms on which future investments may be made by
one or more Grosvenor-Managed Accounts).

DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST


It is Grosvenor's  policy to ACT on each Proxy Request relating to an Immaterial
Proposal,  unless Grosvenor's  Operations Committee determines otherwise.  It is
Grosvenor's  policy to CONSENT to each Proxy  Request  relating to an Immaterial
Proposal,  unless the Primary Investment Principal or a member of the Operations
Committee  objects to the Immaterial  Proposal  before the date specified by the
relevant  Compliance Officer as the last date by which any such objection may be
raised.


Except as provided in the following two paragraphs and as discussed  below under
"MANAGING  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST," it is  Grosvenor's  general  policy to ACT on
each Proxy  Request  relating  to a Material  Proposal  in  accordance  with the
recommendation of the Grosvenor  employee who has been designated by Grosvenor's
Investment  Committee as the primary  investment  principal  with respect to the
investment   manager  or  securities   in  question  (the  "PRIMARY   INVESTMENT
PRINCIPAL"),  as long as such action  would be  consistent  with the  investment
objective(s),  policies  and  restrictions  of  the  relevant  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts.


Grosvenor's  Operations  Committee,  after due  consideration,  may  authorize a
favorable  action on a Material  Proposal even though  favorable  action on such
proposal  would not be  consistent  the  investment  objective(s),  policies and
restrictions  of the relevant  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  upon such terms and
subject to such  conditions  as the  Operations  Committee  may  determine to be
appropriate under the circumstances.


Any member of Grosvenor's  Investment Committee may object to the recommendation
of a Primary Investment Principal in response to a Proxy Request. In the case of
any such  objection,  the matter shall be referred to the Investment  Committee,
whose decision shall be final and conclusive;  provided, however, that the Chief
Executive  Officer  or  Grosvenor's  Operations  Committee  may veto any  action
proposed  to be taken by a Primary  Investment  Principal  or by the  Investment
Committee in response to a Proxy Request.


FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO A
PROXY REQUEST


Grosvenor  expects that Proxy  Requests  frequently  will  request  Grosvenor to
approve measures that reduce the rights,  powers and authority,  and/or increase
the duties and obligations,  associated with the security in question  ("ADVERSE
MEASURES").  For example,  it is anticipated that Proxy Requests frequently will
request  Grosvenor to approve  increased  fees and/or less  favorable  liquidity
provisions relating to Portfolio Funds in which the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
invest.


Nevertheless, it is expected that a Primary Investment Principal ordinarily will
recommend  favorable  action on Proxy Requests that propose Adverse  Measures as
long as such Primary  Investment  Principal  reasonably  believes,  based on the
totality of the facts and  circumstances,  that  continuing to hold the relevant
security has a reasonable  probability  of  conferring  benefits on the relevant
Grosvenor-Managed

<PAGE>

Account(s) (E.G.,  continued access to a high-quality  investment  manager) that
outweigh  the adverse  affect(s) of such Adverse  Measure,  considered  over the
anticipated  holding  period  of such  security  in the  hands  of the  relevant
Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).


MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST


In  furtherance  of  Grosvenor's  goal to take action on all Proxy Requests in a
manner  that  best  serves  the  interests  of  the  affected  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  Grosvenor  will not  implement  any  decision  to  respond to a Proxy
Request in a particular manner unless and until a Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer
has implemented certain procedures to: (i) identify whether Grosvenor is subject
to a conflict of interest  in taking  action in response to such Proxy  Request;
(ii) assess the  materiality  of such a conflict;  and (iii)  address a material
conflict  in a manner  designed  to serve  the best  interests  of the  affected
Grosvenor-Managed   Account(s).  A  conflict  of  interest  ordinarily  will  be
considered material if it can reasonably be argued that Grosvenor (or certain of
its related  persons) has an incentive or otherwise may be influenced to respond
to the Proxy  Request in a manner  designed  to benefit  Grosvenor  (or any such
related person) rather than the affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s) (even if
there is no ostensible  detriment to the affected  Grosvenor-Managed  Account(s)
from  responding  to such request in that manner).  (In addition,  a conflict of
interest  may  be  considered  material  if it can  reasonably  be  argued  that
Grosvenor  has an incentive or otherwise may be influenced to respond to a Proxy
Request in a manner  designed  to favor one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
over  one  or  more   other   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts.)   All   materiality
determinations   are  based  on  an  assessment  of  the  particular  facts  and
circumstances.


If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is subject to a conflict of  interest in taking  action in response to a
Proxy Request but that such  conflict is not material,  he or she shall issue an
instruction  to take action in response to such Proxy Request as provided  above
under "DETERMINING WHAT ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN WITH RESPECT TO A PROXY REQUEST."


If the Grosvenor  Compliance  Officer  determines  that  Grosvenor (or a related
person) is  subject  to a material  conflict  of  interest  in taking  action in
response to a Proxy Request,  he or she shall, in  consultation  with such other
Grosvenor  personnel  as he  or  she  determines  to be  appropriate  under  the
circumstances,  determine how to address such conflict.  In  determining  how to
address a material conflict of interest, the Compliance Officer may consider the
following potential  solutions,  as well as any other solutions he or she wishes
to consider:

         o   in  the  case  of a  non-discretionary  Grosvenor-Managed  Account,
             disclosing the conflict of interest to the appropriate parties;

         o   in  the  case  of  a   discretionary   Grosvenor-Managed   Account,
             disclosing the conflict of interest to the  participant(s)  in such
             Account  and  obtaining  their  consent  (in  accordance  with  the
             governing documents of such Account) to act on the Proxy Request in
             accordance  with the decision  reached by Grosvenor with respect to
             such Proxy Request; and

         o   in  the  case  of  any  Grosvenor-Managed   Account,   engaging  an
             independent  third  party to  recommend  a  response  to the  Proxy
             Request.

In cases where the Compliance  Officer  determines  that Grosvenor (or a related
person) is subject to a conflict of interest in  responding  to a Proxy  Request
and that such conflict is material,  he or she shall not issue an instruction to
take action in response to such Proxy  Request in  accordance  with the decision
reached by  Grosvenor,  or  communicate  the decision  reached by Grosvenor to a
non-discretionary Grosvenor-Managed Account, without first determining that such
action is in the best interests of the affected Grosvenor-Managed Account(s).



ITEM 8.  PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

GROSVENOR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P. ("GROSVENOR")

<PAGE>

         MANAGEMENT. The Fund's assets are managed pursuant to a Sub-Advisory
Agreement by Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Grosvenor"). Grosvenor
maintains an Investment Committee that is responsible for, among other things:

         o   determining the investment objectives and constraints for each
investment fund or account that is managed or advised by Grosvenor (each, a
"Grosvenor-Managed Account"). In the case of the Fund, these investment
objectives and constraints are subject to approval by the Fund's Board of
Directors.

         o   identifying, evaluating and approving (or disapproving) the
investment strategies in which the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the
Fund, may invest.

         o   identifying, evaluating and approving (or disapproving) third-party
investment management firms ("Investment Managers") that employ investment
strategies that have been approved by the Investment Committee.

         o   monitoring investment strategies and Investment Managers.

(1)      For purposes of this column, "master-feeder" structures, which may
     include multiple "feeder" funds, are counted as one account.
(2)      For purposes of this column, "feeders" into a "master fund" are counted
     as individual accounts where they have performance-based fees.
(3)      Total AUM for each account is included. Note, however, that in some
     accounts, some investors may not be subject to performance-based fees.

<PAGE>

         COMPENSATION STRUCTURE. Mr. Sacks and the members of the Investment
Committee each receive a fixed base salary as well as an annual bonus based upon
the success of the firm. In addition, each holds an equity participation, which
entitles him to distributions. Compensation is not based upon the performance or
net asset value of the Fund or any of the other accounts managed by the
Investment Committee.

         OWNERSHIP BY PORTFOLIO MANAGERS. As of March 31, 2009, none of the
individuals at Grosvenor responsible for the day-to-day investment management of
the Fund owns any interests in the Fund.

         CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. Grosvenor is subject to significant conflicts of
interest in managing the business and affairs of the Fund and the other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts and in making investment decisions for them. Such
conflicts could affect Grosvenor's objectivity and the performance of the
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the Fund. Grosvenor has fiduciary duties
to the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts to act in good faith and with fairness in all
its dealings with them, and will take such duties into account in dealing with
all actual and potential conflicts of interest.

         Grosvenor and its related persons will not devote their full business
time to the business and affairs of the Fund or to the Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts in general. Grosvenor and its related persons are free to engage in any
other business or act as investment adviser to or investment manager of
additional Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, whether or not having investment
objectives similar to those of the Fund or other then-existing Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts, on terms (including terms relating to fees and liquidity) that are the
same as or different from those available to investors/participants in the Fund
or other then-existing Grosvenor-Managed Accounts. Nothing in the governing
documents of the Fund or any Grosvenor-Managed Account limits or restricts the
right of Grosvenor and its related persons to engage in and devote time and
attention to other businesses or to render services of whatever kind or nature.

         Grosvenor and its related persons are currently involved in, and may in
the future become involved in, other business ventures, including: (i) investing
in, entering into fee-, revenue- or profit sharing agreements with, operating
and/or managing other investment management or investment advisory firms; and
(ii) managing and/or administering investment funds and accounts in addition to
existing Grosvenor- Managed Accounts. The Grosvenor-Managed Accounts will not
share in the risks or rewards of such other ventures. Further, such other
ventures will both compete with the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts for the time and
attention of Grosvenor and its related persons and potentially create additional
conflicts of interest or raise other special considerations. Grosvenor and its
related persons, in investing and trading for accounts (including their
proprietary accounts) other than the Fund, may make use of information obtained
by them in the course of investing for the Fund. Grosvenor and its related
persons will have no obligation to compensate the Fund in any respect for their
receipt of such information or to account to the Fund for any profits earned
from their use of such information.

         Grosvenor's personnel may discuss investment ideas with portfolio
managers at firms other than Grosvenor. Such discussions may be mutually
beneficial, but may under certain circumstances benefit third-parties with
information developed in connection with operating the Fund or other
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts (and for which the Fund or other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts have paid to develop). It is also possible that such discussions could
ultimately prove to be detrimental to the Fund or other Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts, although Grosvenor considers that possibility to be unlikely.

         Grosvenor and its related persons currently manage or advise numerous
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts in addition to the Fund, and expect to manage or
advise additional Grosvenor-Managed Accounts in the future. Certain of the
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts have or will have investment objectives that are
identical or substantially similar to those of the Fund. It is not anticipated,
however, that the Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts having identical or
substantially similar investment objectives will have identical or substantially
similar investment portfolios. Differing investment portfolios can be expected
to result from several factors, including, without limitation, the following:

<PAGE>

         o    different investment decisions made by the different Grosvenor
              portfolio managers assigned to the different Grosvenor-Managed
              Accounts;

         o    regulatory and/or tax restrictions that apply to certain
              Grosvenor-Managed Accounts but not to others;

         o    investment constraints imposed by the Investment Managers of
              Portfolio Funds on certain Grosvenor-Managed Accounts but not on
              others;

         o    the availability of particular Portfolio Funds for investment by
              Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times but not at others;

         o    different risk/return characteristics (notwithstanding that such
              Grosvenor-Managed Accounts generally have similar investment
              objectives);

         o    client-imposed portfolio management restrictions and/or other
              client instructions; and

         o    the amount of cash available for investment by different
              Grosvenor-Managed Accounts at certain times.

         As a result of  factors  such as these,  the Fund may have a  different
investment  portfolio  (and, as a result,  different  performance  results) from
other   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts   even  though  the  Fund  and  such  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts have identical or substantially  similar  investment
objectives.

         The  Fund  and  other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  may be  managed  by
different  Grosvenor  portfolio  managers  even  though  the Fund and such other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts have identical or substantially  similar  investment
objectives.  Grosvenor's  portfolio managers are authorized to invest the assets
of the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts for which they have investment responsibility
in a wide range of underlying  Portfolio Funds. As a result, it is expected that
the Fund and other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts will have  different  investment
portfolios   resulting  from  different   investment  decisions  made  by  their
respective  Grosvenor  portfolio  managers,  even  if  they  have  identical  or
substantially  similar  investment  objectives.  Further,  the factors described
above  are  likely  to  result in  different  portfolios  for  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts that are managed by the same Grosvenor portfolio managers,  even though
such   Grosvenor-Managed   Accounts  have  identical  or  substantially  similar
investment objectives.

         Regulatory   and/or  tax   restrictions  may  prohibit  the  Fund  from
participating  in  investment  opportunities  that are  available to one or more
other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  Similarly,  the Investment  Managers of the
Portfolio  Funds in which  the Fund  wishes  to  invest  may  impose  investment
restrictions  on the  Fund  but not on other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  Such
restrictions could render the Fund ineligible to invest, in whole or in part, in
a Portfolio Fund in which one or more other Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts are free
to invest, to the possible detriment of the Fund.

         Grosvenor,  its  related  persons  and  one or  more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  may  place  assets  under the  management  of,  or  otherwise  procure
investment  advisory or investment  management  services  from,  any  Investment
Manager  directly  or  indirectly  used by one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,  including the Fund. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Grosvenor,  its related persons and one or more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may
invest in, or withdraw  investments  from,  a  Portfolio  Fund in which the Fund
and/or one or more other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts are  invested,  from which
they are withdrawing their investments or in which they are not invested.

         In certain  instances,  Grosvenor  may be required to allocate  limited
investment  opportunities  in  Portfolio  Funds  among  Grosvenor,  its  related
persons, the Fund and other Grosvenor-Managed Accounts. Grosvenor has

<PAGE>

developed   policies  and   procedures   for   allocating   limited   investment
opportunities   in  a  manner  that  it  believes   to  be   equitable   to  all
Grosvenor-Managed Accounts.

         Grosvenor,  its  related  persons  and  one or  more  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts  that  place  assets  under the  management  of, or  otherwise  procure
investment  advisory or investment  management  services  from,  any  Investment
Manager  directly  or  indirectly  used by the  Fund  and/or  one or more  other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts may do so on terms (including terms relating to fees
and  liquidity)  that  are  more  advantageous  than  those  applicable  to  the
investments made by the Fund and/or such other Grosvenor-Managed Account(s) with
such  Investment  Manager.  To the extent that Grosvenor or its related  persons
invest with a given Investment  Manager on terms that are more advantageous than
those on which the Fund  and/or  one or more  other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
invest with such Investment Manager,  Grosvenor and its related persons may have
an incentive to maintain or increase the  investment  by the Fund and such other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  with  such  Investment  Manager  in order to obtain
and/or  maintain  such  advantageous  terms for the benefit of Grosvenor and its
related persons.

         Grosvenor  and its related  persons may from time to time  invest,  for
their respective proprietary accounts, in early-stage Portfolio Funds (including
Non-Advised  Funds,  as  described  below),  at times when  investments  in such
Portfolio  Funds  are not  appropriate  for the Fund or other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts.  If Grosvenor should  subsequently  determine,  in accordance with its
then-current  criteria  applicable to the  selection of Portfolio  Funds for the
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  that  such  a  Portfolio  Fund  is an  appropriate
investment for the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, Grosvenor and its related persons
will not be  required  to  restructure  the terms on which  they  invest in such
Portfolio Fund in order to make  investments in such Portfolio Fund available to
the Fund if, for  regulatory or other  reasons,  the Fund is (or, in Grosvenor's
reasonable  determination,  may be) precluded  from  investing in such Portfolio
Fund in the absence of such restructuring.

         Grosvenor  and its related  persons may from time to time  invest,  for
their  respective  proprietary  accounts,  in certain  investment funds that are
administered,  but not advised, by Grosvenor (the "NON-ADVISED  Funds") and from
which  they  receive  administrative  or  similar  fees.  In  many  cases,  such
investments may be made at times when  investments in the Non-Advised  Funds are
not appropriate for Grosvenor-Managed Accounts. If Grosvenor should subsequently
determine,  in  accordance  with its  then-current  criteria  applicable  to the
selection of Portfolio  Funds for the  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  that such a
Non-Advised  Fund  is  an  appropriate   investment  for  the  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts,   Grosvenor   may   cause   the  Fund   and/or   one  or  more   other
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  to invest  in such  Non-Advised  Fund  even  though
Grosvenor  continues  to  receive  administrative  or  similar  fees  from  such
Non-Advised Fund. Moreover,  Grosvenor will not be required to reduce, eliminate
or  restructure  the  administrative  or  similar  fees it  receives  from  such
Non-Advised Fund in order to make investments in such Non-Advised Fund available
to the Fund if, for regulatory or other reasons, the Fund is (or, in Grosvenor's
reasonable  determination,  may be) precluded from investing in such Non-Advised
Fund in the absence of such fee reduction, elimination or restructuring.

         A Grosvenor  portfolio  manager might have an incentive to favor one or
more  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts over the Fund (for example, with regard to the
selection  of  Portfolio  Funds  for  those  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts  or the
allocation  of  investment  opportunities  in Portfolio  Funds that have limited
investment capacity), because the "favored" Grosvenor-Managed Accounts might pay
Grosvenor  more  for its  services  than  the  Fund or  other  Grosvenor-Managed
Accounts that invest in the Fund.  Similarly,  a Grosvenor portfolio manager may
have an incentive to favor one or more Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts over the Fund
if  such  portfolio  manager  has  a  personal   investment  in  such  "favored"
Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts.  No  assurance  can be given that (i) the Fund will
participate in all investment opportunities in which other client or proprietary
accounts of  Grosvenor  and its related  persons  participate,  (ii)  particular
investment   opportunities  allocated  to  client  or  proprietary  accounts  of
Grosvenor  and its  related  persons  other  than the Fund  will not  outperform
investment  opportunities  allocated to the Fund,  or (iii) the Fund, on the one
hand, and other similarly-situated  client and proprietary accounts of Grosvenor
and its  related  persons,  on the other  hand,  will  receive  equal or similar
treatment.

         Grosvenor  is  entitled  to receive a portion  of the Fund's  incentive
allocation.  The ability to receive  incentive  allocations  in connection  with
managing the Fund rewards Grosvenor for continuing increases in the

<PAGE>

value of the  assets of the Fund  without  directly  penalizing  it for  losses,
creating an incentive  for it to invest and reinvest the assets of the Fund in a
manner that is riskier or more speculative than would otherwise be the case.

         Grosvenor may from time to time receive,  from  Investment  Managers of
the  Portfolio  Funds in which  the  Fund or  other  Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts
invest,  information  that is not  generally  known to other  investors  in such
Portfolio Funds. In these cases,  legal or regulatory  constraints could prevent
Grosvenor from acting in the manner in which it otherwise would act on behalf of
the Fund or another Grosvenor-Managed Account.

         Different participants in the same Grosvenor-Managed Account (including
the Fund),  as well as certain other persons  (including  persons who may have a
direct or indirect  interest in Grosvenor and persons who were  previously,  but
who are not currently,  associated with Grosvenor),  receive reporting  packages
from Grosvenor that differ in form,  substance,  level of detail,  timing and/or
frequency.  In particular,  certain reporting  packages may include  information
relating to Portfolio Funds in which the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including
the Fund, invest (or in which they are  contemplating an investment).  Grosvenor
ordinarily does not place restrictions on a recipient's use of such information,
and a recipient could use such  information to invest directly in or withdraw or
redeem from Portfolio Funds in which the Grosvenor-Managed  Accounts,  including
the Fund, invest (or in which they are contemplating an investment), potentially
in competition with the Grosvenor-Managed Accounts, including the Fund.

         Certain of the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests may hold notes
or other securities issued from time to time by Grosvenor,  and Grosvenor may be
aware that such Portfolio Funds do so. Grosvenor does not believe, however, that
either of the foregoing  circumstances will in any respect influence Grosvenor's
selection of Portfolio Funds.

         The  Investment  Managers  are likely to be subject to many of the same
types of conflict of interest to which  Grosvenor is subject.  For example,  the
Investment  Managers may be involved in other business  ventures,  including the
management  and/or  administration  of other investment funds and accounts whose
investment  objectives  are identical or  substantially  similar to those of the
Portfolio  Funds.  Neither  the  Fund nor the Fund  will  share in the  risks or
rewards of such other  ventures.  In addition,  such other ventures will compete
with the  relevant  Portfolio  Funds for the time and  attention of the relevant
Investment Managers,  and might create additional conflicts of interest or raise
other special considerations.

         The  Investment  Managers have  responsibility  for investing the funds
allocated to them. The Investment Managers also manage other accounts (including
other  accounts in which they may have an interest)  and may have  financial and
other  incentives to favor such  accounts over the Portfolio  Funds in which the
Fund invests.  In investing on behalf of other clients, as well as the Portfolio
Funds in which the Fund invests,  the  Investment  Managers must allocate  their
resources, as well as limited market opportunities.  Doing so could increase the
level of competition  for the same trades that  otherwise  might be made for the
Portfolio  Funds in which the Fund invests,  including  the  priorities of order
entry,  as well as  make it  difficult  or  impossible  to take or  liquidate  a
particular position at a price indicated by an Investment Manager's strategy.

         In  addition,  in  connection  with  investing  and  trading  for other
accounts, including their proprietary accounts, the Investment Managers may make
use of  information  obtained by them in the course of investing and trading for
the Portfolio  Funds.  They will have no obligation to compensate  the Portfolio
Funds in any respect for their receipt of such  information or to account to any
such Portfolio Fund for any profits earned from their use of such information.

         The Investment  Managers and their principals,  in managing  investment
accounts other than the Portfolio Funds,  may employ trading  methods,  policies
and  strategies  which  differ  from those  which they  employ on behalf of such
Portfolio  Funds.  Therefore,  the  results  of the Fund's  investments  in such
Portfolio  Funds may differ from the results of other  accounts  managed by such
Investment Managers.

         The  Investment  Managers value the illiquid,  longer-term  investments
held by  their  Portfolio  Funds  in a  variety  of  different  ways,  and  have
considerable discretion in doing so. The Investment Managers have a conflict

<PAGE>

of interest in arriving at such valuations, which affect both the performance of
their Portfolio Funds and the advisory  compensation  received by the Investment
Managers.

         The  Investment  Managers  have a conflict of  interest  in  allocating
capital to longer-term  and/or  illiquid  investments.  While such positions may
hold  significant  profit potential (and,  therefore,  the potential to generate
substantial  incentive  compensation),  they can create  material  valuation and
illiquidity risks for investors. In addition, performance fees may be calculated
separately  in  respect  of  certain  longer-term  and/or  illiquid  investments
irrespective of the overall performance of a Portfolio Fund.

         The  Investment  Managers  select the brokers and dealers  that execute
transactions  for their  respective  Portfolio  Funds and  negotiate the related
brokerage  commissions and other  transaction  costs.  In selecting  brokers and
dealers and/or in negotiating  commissions  and other  compensation,  Investment
Managers  (subject  to their  overall  duty to obtain  "best  execution"  of all
transactions  for the  Portfolio  Funds they manage)  have  authority to and may
consider the full range and quality of the  services  and  products  provided by
various  brokers and dealers and do not  necessarily  select brokers and dealers
that charge the lowest  transaction  costs.  An  Investment  Manager may cause a
Portfolio Fund to pay  transaction  costs to a broker or dealer even though such
Investment  Manager  and/or clients of such  Investment  Manager other than such
Portfolio Fund are the exclusive beneficiaries of non-execution related products
and services provided by such broker or dealer.

APPLICABLE AUTHORITY            Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;
                                Item 2 of Form N-CSR

- ------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW AND STATEMENT
- ----------------------

Item 2 of Form N-CSR, the form used by registered management investment
companies to file certified shareholder reports, requires a registered
management investment company to disclose (1) whether it has adopted a code of
ethics that applies to the investment company's principal executive officer and
senior financial officers and, if it has not adopted such a code of ethics, why
it has not done so, and (2) any amendments to, or waivers from, the code of
ethics relating to such officers.

The Board of each Fund has adopted the following Code of Ethics, which sets
forth the ethical standards to which the Fund holds its principal executive
officer and each of its senior financial officers.

FUND LEVEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
- ----------------------------------

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This Code of Ethics (the "Code") applies to the Fund's Principal
Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer
or Controller (the "Covered Officers") for the purpose of promoting:

         o    honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
              actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
              professional relationships;

         o    full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
              reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
              SEC, and in other public communications made by the Fund;

         o    compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
              regulations;

<PAGE>

         o    the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
              appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o    accountability for adherence to the Code.

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual or
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.      ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE

         The Board has designated an individual to be primarily responsible for
the administration of the Code (the "Code Officer"). In the absence of the Code
Officer, his or her designee shall serve as the Code Officer, but only on a
temporary basis.

         The Board has designated a person who meets the definition of a chief
legal officer (the "CLO") for purposes of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
rules promulgated thereunder as the Fund's CLO. The CLO of the Fund shall assist
the Fund's Code Officer in administration of this Code. The Code Officer, in
consultation with the CLO, shall be responsible for applying this Code to
specific situations (in consultation with Fund counsel, where appropriate) and
has the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.

III.     MANAGING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
personal interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to,
the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a
result of the Covered Officer's position with the Fund.

         Certain provisions in the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and the Advisers Act and the rules and regulations thereunder govern
certain conflicts of interest that arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund. If such conflicts are addressed in conformity
with applicable provisions of the 1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be
deemed to have been handled ethically. For example, Covered Officers may not
individually engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of
securities or other property) with the Fund because of their status as
"affiliated persons" of the Fund. The Fund's and its Adviser's compliance
programs and procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct,
violations of those provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to,
repeat or replace those programs and procedures, and conduct that is consistent
with such programs and procedures falls outside of the parameters of this Code.

<PAGE>

         Although they do not typically present an opportunity for improper
personal benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationships between the Fund and, as applicable, its Adviser, administrator,
principal underwriter, pricing and bookkeeping agent and/or transfer agent
(each, a "Primary Service Provider") of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the
Fund or for a Primary Service Provider, or for both), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Primary Service Providers and the Fund. The participation of the
Covered Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationships
between the Fund and the Primary Service Providers and is consistent with the
performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. If
such conflicts are addressed in conformity with applicable provisions of the
1940 Act and the Advisers Act, they will be deemed to have been handled
ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the Board of the Fund that the
Covered Officers also may be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies or organizations affiliated with the sponsor of the Fund
covered by other similar codes and that the codes of ethics of those other
investment companies or organizations will apply to the Covered Officers acting
in such capacities for such other investment companies.

         This Code covers conflicts of interest that are not subject to
provisions in the 1940 Act and Advisers Act. The overarching principle is that
the personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly
before the interests of the Fund. Certain examples of such conflicts of interest
follow.

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o    not knowingly use his or her personal influence or personal
              relationships improperly to influence investment decisions or
              financial reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered Officer, or a
              member of his or her family, would benefit personally to the
              detriment of the Fund;

         o    not knowingly cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take
              action, for the individual personal benefit of the Covered
              Officer, or a member of his or her family, rather than the benefit
              of the Fund;

         o    not use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions
              made or contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause
              others to trade personally in contemplation of the market effect
              of such transactions; and

         o    report at least annually (or more frequently, as appropriate)
              known affiliations or other relationships that may give rise to
              conflicts of interest with respect to the Fund.

<PAGE>

         If a Covered Officer believes that he or she has a potential conflict
of interest that is likely to materially compromise his or her objectivity or
his or her ability to perform the duties of his or her role as a Covered
Officer, including a potential conflict of interest that arises out of his or
her responsibilities as an officer or employee of one or more Primary Service
Providers or other funds, he or she should consult with the Code Officer, the
CLO, the Fund's outside counsel, or counsel to the Independent Board Members, as
appropriate.

         Examples of potential conflicts of interest that may materially
compromise objectivity or ability to perform the duties of a Covered Officer and
which the Covered Officer should consider discussing with the Code Officer or
other appropriate person include:

         o    service as a director on the board of a public or private company
              or service as a public official;

         o    the receipt of a non-de minimis gift when the gift is in relation
              to doing business directly or indirectly with the Fund;

         o    the receipt of entertainment from any company with which the Fund
              has current or prospective business dealings, unless such
              entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
              as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
              of impropriety;

         o    an ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
              relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than
              the Primary Service Providers or any affiliated person thereof;
              and

         o    a direct or indirect material financial interest in commissions,
              transaction charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting
              portfolio transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other
              than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment,
              such as compensation or equity ownership.

IV.      DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer:

         o    to familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements
              generally applicable to the Fund, as well as the business and
              financial operations of the Fund;

         o    to not knowingly misrepresent, and to not knowingly cause others

<PAGE>

              Independent Board Members and auditors, and to governmental
              regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o    to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
              responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
              Fund and the Primary Service Providers with the goal of promoting
              full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
              reports and documents the Fund files with, or submits to, the SEC
              and in other public communications made by the Fund; and

         o    to adhere to and, within his or her area of responsibility,
              promote compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by
              applicable laws, rules and regulations.

V.       REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o    upon adoption of the Code or becoming a Covered Officer,
              acknowledge in writing to the Fund's Board that he or she has
              received, read and understands the Code, using the form attached
              as Appendix I hereto;

         o    annually thereafter acknowledge in writing to the Fund's Board
              that he or she has received and read the Code and believes that he
              or she has complied with the requirements of the Code, using the
              form attached as Appendix II hereto;

         o    not retaliate against any employee or Covered Officer for reports
              of potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o    notify the Code Officer promptly if he or she knows of any
              violation, or of conduct that reasonably could be expected to be
              or result in a violation, of this Code. Failure to do so is a
              violation of this Code.

         The Fund will follow the procedures set forth below in investigating
and enforcing this Code:

         o    The Code Officer will endeavor to take all appropriate action to
              investigate any potential violation reported to him or her;

         o    If, after such investigation, the Code Officer believes that no
              violation has occurred, the Code Officer will so notify the
              person(s) reporting the potential violation, and no further action
              is required;

         o    Any matter that the Code Officer, upon consultation with the CLO,
              believes is a violation will be reported by the Code Officer or
              the CLO to the Fund's Audit Committee;

<PAGE>

         o    If the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it
              will inform and make a recommendation to the Fund's Board, which
              will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
              appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
              notification to the appropriate personnel of the Fund's Primary
              Service Providers or their boards; a recommendation to censure,
              suspend or dismiss the Covered Officer; or referral of the matter
              to the appropriate authorities for civil action or criminal
              prosecution;

         o    The Fund's Audit Committee will be responsible for granting
              waivers, as appropriate; and

         o    This Code and any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the
              extent required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

         The Code Officer shall report to the Fund's Audit Committee quarterly

Providers as set forth in their respect Compliance Manuals are separate

the Fund's Board, the Covered Officers, the Code Officer, the CLO, the Fund's
Primary Service Providers and their

affiliates, and outside audit firms, legal counsel to the Fund and legal counsel
to the Independent Board Members and to the Primary Service Providers and their
affiliates.

(6) years from the date such action is taken, the first two (2) years in an
easily accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the
Audit Committee or the Board: (i) that provided the basis for any amendment or
waiver to this Code; and (ii) relating to any violation of the Code and
sanctions imposed for such violation, together with a written record of the
approval or action taken by the Audit Committee and/or Board.

         The CLO is responsible for maintaining (i) a current list of the Fund's
Covered Officers and (ii) records of all activities related to this Policy,
including those records required to be maintained by the Fund pursuant to the
preceding paragraph.

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does

circumstance, or legal conclusion.
