<p><font face="Arial" size="5">Review of Period</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What happened in the market during the
 first half of 2016?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After a rocky start to calendar year 2016,
 stocks quickly recouped lost ground and finished the six months ended June 30, 2016
 with solid, if unspectacular, gains. The S&#038;P 500<sup>&#174;</sup> Index returned 3.84% over
 the last six months. Mid cap stocks, as measured by the Russell Mid Cap<sup>&#174;</sup> Index,
 returned 5.50%, and small caps advanced 2.22% based on the Russell 2000<sup>&#174;</sup> Index.
 Global equities, as measured by the MSCI EAFE Index, returned -4.42% as European
 economies continued to struggle with sub-par economic growth, a strong U.S. dollar,
 the need for stimulative monetary policies, and near the end of the quarter, an
 affirmative vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. Bonds were the
 lead performer in U.S. capital markets, with the Barclays Aggregate Index returning
 5.31% for the period, and the Barclays Intermediate Government/Credit Index returning
 4.07%. Lower long-term interest rates allowed bonds to fare favorably as the U.S.
 Federal Reserve paused after its initial increase in the Federal Funds Rate pending
 further information on the health of the U.S. economy. A late quarter flight to
 quality after the &#147;Brexit&#148; vote left 10 year maturity U.S. Treasury yields
 within 10 basis points of the lows recorded during the financial crisis.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Growth in U.S. output continues to be sluggish,
 uneven and sub-par by historical standards, with first quarter 2016 real GDP growing
 1.1% at an annualized rate. Inflation remains tame, helped overall by a significant
 pullback in energy prices during the period despite a recovery surge during the
 second quarter. Even without the volatile food and energy sectors included, inflation
 rates remain within a range that gives comfort, for now, to Fed policy makers. As
 a result, it seems unlikely that the Fed will raise rates in the near-term, preferring
 to continue its wait-and-see stance. One bright spot for the economy continues to
 be the labor market, with the unemployment rate continuing a gradual decline and
 labor costs beginning to show signs of advance. A higher rate of compensation growth
 would be a welcome development for U.S. workers, putting more discretionary income
 in their pockets and supporting a higher rate of consumption spending.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The wild card, as the year continues, will
 be developments on the political front, both globally and here at home in the U.S.
 Uncertainty surrounding the implications of the UK&#146;s decision to withdraw from
 the EU continue to weigh on global markets, and political upheaval in the UK and
 tough rhetoric from Europe are contributing to heightened daily price volatility.
 As we head in earnest into election season here in the U.S., it&#146;s difficult
 to predict how political projections will affect the markets. Fortunately, the direct
 impact on the types of companies in which we invest should be minor, as they continue
 to produce solid results in a slowly expanding domestic economy. We will be carefully
 monitoring the political backdrop around the world as the summer progresses for
 signs of impact on the markets and the companies we hold.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>How did the Fund perform given the marketplace
 conditions during the first six months of 2016?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">For the six months ending June 30, 2016,
 the Fund&#146;s Net Asset Value (NAV) rose 3.34%, outperforming the CBOE S&#038;P
 BuyWrite Index (BXM) return of 2.43%. The S&#038;P 500 rose 3.84% during the period.
 The Fund&#146;s market price rose 8.79% as the discount to NAV narrowed during the
 period from -13% to -8.8%. On an NAV basis, the Fund was consistently ahead of the
 BXM index for the full period. The Fund entered the year with a very conservative
 posture which led to positive relative results as the market corrected in January
 and early February.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>MCN</b> | Madison Covered Call &#038;
 Equity Strategy Fund | <b>Review of Period (unaudited)</b> - continued | June 30, 2016</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">the first quarter. The April/May period
 was one of market consolidation with the S&#038;P 500 trading sideways in a very
 narrow range. During this period, the Fund was able to maintain and slightly increase
 its performance lead over the BXM index primarily by adding value as the market
 moved toward the lower end of the trading range. In early June, as the Brexit fears
 began to increase market volatility, despite being very well hedged, the Fund gave
 up some ground to the BXM as the index was extremely hedged going into the actual
 Brexit vote. As the market negatively reacted to the vote over the following 2 day
 period, the Fund again lost ground to the well hedged BXM but outperformed the overall
 market. The sharp market decline resulted in the BXM becoming almost completely
 unhedged over a very short period of 2 days and the subsequent bounce in the market
 resulted in the BXM capturing a good degree of the upside. The Fund did not exhibit
 such a large swing in its hedged levels and was a much steadier performer over the
 intensely volatile market reaction. The end result was that the Fund maintained
 its advantage over the BXM but gave up some ground as a direct result of the Brexit
 extreme volatility. Relative to the S&#038;P 500, stock selection and sector allocation
 within the Fund were both positive contributors to performance. The largest positive
 influences from a sector perspective were the Fund&#146;s allocation to gold, which
 surged in price, the Fund&#146;s underweighting in the Financial sector, which was
 a poor relative performer, and the Fund&#146;s higher exposure to Energy stocks,
 which rebounded nicely along with the price of crude oil. The single largest negative
 impact came from the Fund&#146;s absence from the Utilities sector which was one
 of the top performing areas of the market given the declining trend of interest
 rates. Slowing revenue and earnings growth along with an economy that is struggling
 to gain momentum has resulted in increased concern and volatility as the market
 struggles to maintain its elevated levels.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Describe the Fund&#146;s portfolio equity
 and option structure.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As of June 30, 2016, the Fund held 44 equity
 securities (including investment companies) and unexpired call options had been
 written against 81.1% of the Fund&#146;s stock holdings. It is the strategy of the
 Fund to write &#147;out-of-the-money&#148; call options. As of June 30, 76.3% of
 the Fund&#146;s call options (61 of 80 different options) remained &#147;out-of-the-money.&#148; (Out-of-the-money means the stock price is below the strike price at which
 the shares could be called away by the option holder). On average, the Fund&#146;s
 call options were 2.6% out-of-the-money at period end and the average time to expiration
 of the options within the Fund was 45.5 days.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Which sectors are prevalent in the Fund?
</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">From a sector perspective, MCN&#146;s largest
 exposure as of June 30, 2016 was to the Information Technology sector which was
 slightly higher than that within the S&#038;P 500, followed by the Health Care sector
 which was also higher than the S&#038;P 500 weight. This was followed by a small
 underweighting in the Consumer Discretionary sector and an underweighting in the
 Financial sector. The Fund&#146;s next largest sector exposure was a small overweight
 in the Energy sector followed by an underweight in the Industrial sector. The Fund
 had smaller exposure to the Consumer Staples and Telecom sectors while being absent
 the Materials and Utilities sectors.</font></p>

 option selection process.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fund is managed by primarily focusing
 on active stock selection before adding the call option overlay utilizing individual
 equity call options rather than index options. We use fundamental analysis to select
 solid companies with good growth prospects and attractive valuations. We then seek
 attractive call options to write on those stocks. It is our belief that this partnership
 of active management of the equity and option strategies provides investors with
 an innovative, risk-moderated approach to equity investing. The Fund&#146;s portfolio

 Equity Strategy Fund | <b>Review of Period (unaudited)</b> - continued | June 30, 2016</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">portfolio of common stocks that have favorable
 &#147;PEG&#148; ratios (Price-Earnings ratio to Growth rate) as well as financial
 strength and industry leadership. As bottom-up investors, we focus on the fundamental
 businesses of our companies. Our stock selection philosophy strays away from the
 &#147;beat the street&#148; mentality, as we seek companies that have sustainable
 competitive advantages, predictable cash flows, solid balance sheets and high-quality
 management teams. By concentrating on long-term prospects and circumventing the
 &#147;instant gratification&#148; school of thought, we believe we bring elements
 of consistency, stability and predictability to our shareholders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Once we have selected attractive and solid
 names for the Fund, we employ our call writing strategy. This procedure entails
 selling calls that are primarily out-of the-money, meaning that the strike price
 is higher than the common stock price, so that the Fund can participate in some
 stock appreciation. By receiving option premiums, the Fund receives a high level
 of investment income and adds an element of downside protection. Call options may
 be written over a number of time periods and at differing strike prices in an effort
 to maximize the protective value to the strategy and spread income evenly throughout
 the year.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What is the management&#146;s outlook
 for the market and Fund for the remainder of 2016?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Markets hate uncertainty as was just recently
 illustrated by the extreme volatility that ensued from an unexpected Brexit result.
 Unfortunately, we remain awash in that commodity. Geo-political uncertainty has
 become the norm in recent years, but that doesn&#146;t mean its impact has disappeared.
 Clearly, the world we live in has become more perilous, not less. Negative events
 overseas will elicit market reaction particularly if such events impact consumer
 and other economic behavior. Domestically, the political situation is anything but
 stable and there is the potential for a very divisive and unconventional run to
 our presidential election. Our domestic economy has shown some signs of improvement,
 but its stability is far from given. The markets will continue to be driven, in
 part, by each new tidbit of economic data as it&#146;s released.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Volatility is likely to ebb and flow in
 the future rather than remain at historically low levels. It will be much more of
 a recurring staple of our investment lives going forward than it has been over the
 past 7 year bull market. The strategy of covered call writing on top of a high quality
 equity portfolio can help buffer the volatility while still participating in the
 long term benefits of equity investing. We are always looking for a margin of safety
 in our lives while living life to its fullest. Our strategy takes care of this from
 an investing perspective.</font></p>

 Equity Strategy Fund | June 30, 2016</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5">Notes to Financial Statements</font> <font face="Arial" size="2"><b>(unaudited)</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1. ORGANIZATION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Madison Covered Call &#038; Equity Strategy
 Fund (the &#147;Fund&#148;) was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on May 6,
 2004. The Fund is registered as a diversified, closed-end management investment
 company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (&#147;1940 Act&#148;), as amended,
 and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fund&#146;s primary investment objective
 is to provide a high level of current income and current gains, with a secondary
 objective of long-term capital appreciation. The Fund will pursue its investment
 objectives by investing primarily in large and mid-capitalization common stocks
 that are, in the view of Madison Asset Management, LLC, the Fund&#146;s investment
 adviser (the &#147;Adviser&#148;), selling at a reasonable price in relation to
 their long-term earnings growth rates. Under normal market conditions, the Fund
 will seek to generate current earnings from option premiums by writing (selling)
 covered call options on a substantial portion of its portfolio securities. There
 can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The Fund&#146;s investment objectives are considered fundamental and may not be changed without
 shareholder approval.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fund is an investment company that applies
 the accounting and reporting guidance in the Financial Accounting Standards Board
 (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946, <i>Financial Services - Investment
 Companies (ASC 946)</i>. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
 consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Use of Estimates</i>. The preparation of financial
 statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
 States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Such estimates
 affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of increases
 and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual
 results could differ from those estimates.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Portfolio Valuation</i>. Securities traded on
 a national securities exchange are valued at their closing sale price, except for
 securities traded on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
 System (&#147;NASDAQ&#148;), which are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price
 (&#147;NOCP&#148;), and options, which are valued at the mean between the best bid
 and best ask price across all option exchanges. Debt securities having maturities
 of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value.
 Debt securities having longer maturities are valued on the basis of the last available
 bid prices or current market quotations provided by dealers or pricing services
 approved by the Fund. Mutual funds are valued at their Net Asset Value (&#147;NAV&#148;). Securities for which market quotations are not readily available are valued
 at their fair value as determined in good faith under procedures approved by the
 Board of Trustees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">At times, the Fund maintains cash balances
 at financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Fund monitors
 this credit risk and has not experienced any losses related to this risk.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fund has adopted Financial Accounting
 Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) applicable guidance on fair value measurements.
 Fair value is defined as the price that each fund would receive upon selling an
 investment in a timely transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most
 advantageous market of the investment. A three-tier hierarchy is used to maximize
 the use of observable market data &#147;inputs&#148; and minimize the use of unobservable
 &#147;inputs&#148; and to establish classification of fair value measurements for
 disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants
 would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk (for
 example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair
 value including such a pricing model and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the
 valuation technique). Inputs may be observable or unobservable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Observable inputs are inputs that reflect
 the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
 developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
 entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the reporting entity&#146;s
 own assumptions about the assumptions market participants</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Distributions to Shareholders</i>. The
 Fund declares and pays quarterly distributions to shareholders. Distributions to
 shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions
 are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ
 from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These distributions consist
 of investment company taxable income, which generally includes qualified dividend
 income, ordinary income and short-term capital gains, including premiums received
 on written options. Distributions may also include a return of capital. Any net
 realized long-term capital gains are distributed annually to shareholders.</font></p>

</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement
 between the Fund and the Adviser, the Adviser, under the supervision of the Fund&#146;s Board of Trustees, provides a continuous investment program for the Fund&#146;s portfolio; provides investment research and makes and executes recommendations
 for the purchase and sale of securities; and provides certain facilities and personnel,
 including officers required for the Fund&#146;s administrative management and compensation
 of all officers and trustees of the Fund and its affiliates. For these services,
 the Fund pays the Adviser a fee, payable monthly, in an amount equal to an annualized
 rate of 0.80% of the Fund&#146;s average daily net assets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Under a separate Services Agreement, the
 Adviser also provides or arranges to have a third party provide the
 Fund with such services as it may require in the ordinary course of its business.
 Services to the Fund include: compliance services, custodial services, fund administration
 services, fund accounting services, and such other services necessary to conduct
 the Fund&#146;s business. In addition, the Adviser shall arrange and pay for independent
 public accounting services for audit and tax purposes, legal services, the services
 of independent trustees of the Fund, a fidelity bond, and directors and officers/errors
 and omissions insurance. In exchange for these services, the Fund pays the Adviser
 a service fee, payable monthly, equal to an annualized rate of 0.26% of the Fund&#146;s average daily net assets. Not included in this fee and, therefore, the responsibility
 of the Fund are &#147;excluded expenses&#148; and &#147;transitional expenses.&#148;
 Excluded expenses consist of (i) any fees and expenses relating to portfolio holdings
 (e.g., brokerage commissions, interest on loans, etc.); (ii) extraordinary and non-recurring
 fees and expenses (e.g., costs relating to any borrowing costs or taxes the Fund
 may owe, etc.); and (iii) the costs associated with investment by the Trust in other
 investment companies (i.e., acquired fund fees and expenses).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Certain officers and trustees of the Fund
 may also be officers, directors and/or employees of the Adviser or its affiliates.
 The Fund does not compensate its officers or trustees who are officers, directors
 and/or employees of the Adviser or its affiliates. The fees for the independent
 trustees are paid out of the Services Agreement fee and totaled $18,000 for the
 period ended June 30, 2016.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>4. FEDERAL INCOME TAX INFORMATION</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">No provision is made for federal income
 taxes since it is the intention of the Fund to comply with the provisions of Subchapter
 M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 available to investment companies and to
 make the requisite distribution to shareholders of taxable income, which will be
 sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all federal income taxes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>6. COVERED CALL AND PUT OPTIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">An option on a security is a contract that
 gives the holder of the option, in return for a premium, the right to buy from (in
 the case of a call) or sell to (in the case of a put) the writer of the option the
 security underlying the option at a specified exercise or &#147;strike&#148; price.
 The writer of an option on a security has an obligation upon exercise of the option
 to deliver the underlying security upon payment of the exercise price (in the case
 of a call) or pay the exercise price upon delivery of the underlying security (in
 the case of a put).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The number of call options the Fund can
 write (sell) is limited by the amount of equity securities the Fund holds in its
 portfolio. The Fund will not write (sell) &#147;naked&#148; or uncovered call options.
 The Fund seeks to produce a high level of current income and gains generated from
 option writing premiums and, to a lesser extent, from dividends.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When an option is written, a liability is
 recorded equal to the premium received. This liability for options written is marked-to-market
 on a daily basis to reflect the current market value of the option written. These
 liabilities are reflected as options written in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
 Premiums received from writing options that expire unexercised are recorded on the
 expiration date as a realized gain. The difference between the premium received
 and the amount paid on effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage
 commissions, is also treated as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than
 the amount paid for the closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a
 call option is exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of
 the underlying security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or
 loss.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>8. INDEMNIFICATIONS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the normal course of business, the Fund
 enters into contracts that provide general indemnifications. The Fund&#146;s maximum
 exposure under these arrangements is dependent upon claims that may be made against
 the Fund in the future and, therefore cannot be estimated; however, the Fund considers
 the risk of material loss from such claims as remote.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>9. DISCUSSION OF RISKS</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Equity Risk</i>. The value of the securities
 held by the Fund may decline due to general market and economic conditions, perceptions
 regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the Fund participate,
 or factors relating to specific companies in which the Fund invests.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Option Risk</i>. There are several risks
 associated with transactions in options on securities. For example, there are significant
 differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an imperfect
 correlation between these markets, causing a given transaction not to achieve its
 objectives. A decision as to whether, when and how to use options involves the exercise
 of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived transaction may be unsuccessful
 to some degree because of market behavior or unexpected events.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As the writer of a covered call option,
 the Fund forgoes, during the option&#146;s life, the opportunity to profit from
 increases in the market value of the security covering the call option above the
 sum of the premium and the strike price of the call, but retains the risk of loss
 should the price of the underlying security decline. The writer of an option has
 no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation as a
 writer of the option. Once an option writer has received an exercise notice, it
 cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate its obligation
 under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the exercise price.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the Fund writes covered put options,
 it bears the risk of loss if the value of the underlying stock declines below the
 exercise price. If the option is exercised, the Fund could incur a loss if it is
 required to purchase the stock underlying the put option at a price greater than
 the market price of the stock at the time of exercise. While the Fund&#146;s potential
 gain in writing a covered put option is limited to the interest earned on the liquid
 assets securing the put option plus the premium received from the purchaser of the
 put option, the Fund risks a loss equal to the entire value of the stock.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Foreign Investment Risk</i>. Investing
 in non-U.S. issuers may involve unique risks such as currency, political, and economic
 risks, as well as lower market liquidity, generally greater market volatility and
 less complete financial information than for U.S. issuers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Mid-Cap Company Risk</i>. Mid-Cap companies
 often are newer or less established companies than larger companies. Investments
 in mid-cap companies carry additional risks because earnings of these companies
 tend to be less predictable; they often have limited product lines, markets, distribution
 channels or financial resources; and the management of such companies may be dependent
 upon one or a few key people. The market movements of equity securities of mid-cap
 companies may be more abrupt or erratic than the market movements of equity securities
 of larger, more established companies or the stock market in general.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Industry Concentration Risk</i>. To the
 extent that the Fund makes substantial investments in a single industry, the Fund
 will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting
 those sectors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Fund Distribution Risk</i>. In order
 to make regular quarterly distributions on its common shares, the Fund may have
 to sell a portion of its investment portfolio at a time when independent investment
 judgment may not dictate such action. In addition, the Fund&#146;s ability to make
 distributions more frequently than annually from any net realized capital gains
 by the Fund is subject to the Fund obtaining exemptive relief from the Securities
 and Exchange</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Commission, which cannot be assured. To
 the extent the total quarterly distributions for a year exceed the Fund&#146;s net
 investment company income and net realized capital gain for that year, the excess
 will generally constitute a return of the Fund&#146;s capital to its common shareholders.
 Such return of capital distributions generally are tax-free up to the amount of
 a common shareholder&#146;s tax basis in the common shares (generally, the amount
 paid for the common shares). In addition, such excess distributions will decrease
 the Fund&#146;s total assets and may increase the Fund&#146;s expense ratio.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Financial Leverage Risk</i>. The Fund
 is authorized to utilize leverage through the issuance of preferred shares and/
 or the Fund may borrow or issue debt securities for financial leveraging purposes
 and for temporary purposes such as settlement of transactions. Although the use
 of any financial leverage by the Fund may create an opportunity for increased net
 income, gains and capital appreciation for common shares, it also results in additional
 risks and can magnify the effect of any losses. If the income and gains earned on
 securities purchased with financial leverage proceeds are greater than the cost
 of financial leverage, the Fund&#146;s return will be greater than if financial
 leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income or gain from the securities
 purchased with such proceeds does not cover the cost of financial leverage, the
 return to the Fund will be less than if financial leverage had not been used. Financial
 leverage also increases the likelihood of greater volatility of the NAV and market
 price of, and dividends on, the common shares than a comparable portfolio without
 leverage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Recent Market Developments Risk</i>.
 Global and domestic financial markets have periodically experienced periods of unprecedented
 turmoil. Recently, markets have witnessed more stabilized economic activity as expectations
 for an economic recovery increased. However, risks to a robust resumption of growth
 persist. Continuing uncertainty as to the status of the euro and European Monetary
 Union has created significant volatility in currency and financial markets generally.
 A return to unfavorable economic conditions or sustained economic slowdown could
 adversely impact the Fund&#146;s portfolio. Financial market conditions, as well
 as various social and political tensions in the United States and around the world,
 may contribute to increased market volatility and may have long-term effects on
 the United States and worldwide financial markets and cause further economic uncertainties
 or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. The Fund&#146;s Investment
 Adviser does not know how long the financial markets will continue to be affected
 by these events and cannot predict the effects of these or similar events in the
 future on the United States and global economies and securities markets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Cybersecurity Risk</i>. The Fund is also
 subject to cybersecurity risk, which includes the risks associated with computer
 systems, networks and devices to carry out routine business operations. These systems,
 networks and devices employ a variety of protections that are designed to prevent
 cyberattacks. Despite the various cyber protections utilized by the Fund, the Investment
 Adviser, and other service providers, their systems, networks, or devices could
 potentially be breached. The Fund, its shareholders, and the Investment Adviser
 could be negatively impacted as a result of a cybersecurity breach. The Fund cannot
 control the cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers or
 any other third parties whose operations may affect the Fund. The Fund does monitor
 this risk closely.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><i>Additional Risks</i>. While investments
 in securities have been keystones in wealth building and management, at times these
 investments have produced surprises. Those who enjoyed growth and income of their
 investments generally were rewarded for the risks they took by investing in the
 markets. Although the Investment Adviser seeks to appropriately address and manage
 the risks identified and disclosed to you in connection with the management of the
 securities in the Fund, you should understand that the very nature of the securities
 markets includes the possibility that there may be additional risks of which we
 are not aware. We certainly seek to identify all applicable risks and then appropriately
 address them, take appropriate action to reasonably manage them and to make you
 aware of them so you can determine if they exceed your risk tolerance. Nevertheless,
 the often volatile nature of the securities markets and the global economy in which
 we work suggests that the risk of the unknown is something to consider in connection
 with an investment in securities. Unforeseen events could under certain</font></p>

 Equity Strategy Fund | <b>Dividend Reinvestment Plan</b> - concluded | June 30, 2016</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Plan Administrator will open an account
 for each common shareholder under the Plan in the same name in which such common
 shareholder&#146;s common shares are registered. Whenever the Fund declares a dividend
 or other distribution (together, a &#147;Dividend&#148;) payable in cash, non-participants
 in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent
 in common shares. The common shares will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for
 the participants&#146; accounts, depending upon the circumstances described below,
 either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized common shares from
 the Fund (&#147;Newly Issued Common Shares&#148;) or (ii) by purchase of outstanding
 common shares on the open market (&#147;Open-Market Purchases&#148;) on the New
 York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the
 closing market price plus estimated brokerage commission per common share is equal
 to or greater than the net asset value per common share, the Plan Administrator
 will invest the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares on behalf of the participants.
 The number of Newly Issued Common Shares to be credited to each participant&#146;s
 account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Dividend by the
 net asset value per common share on the payment date; provided that, if the net
 asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the closing market value on the payment
 date, the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by 95% of the closing market
 price per common share on the payment date. If, on the payment date for any Dividend,
 the net asset value per common share is greater than the closing market value plus
 estimated brokerage commission, the Plan Administrator will invest the Dividend
 amount in common shares acquired on behalf of the participants in Open-Market Purchases.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If, before the Plan Administrator has completed
 its Open-Market Purchases, the market price per common share exceeds the net asset
 value per common share, the average per common share purchase price paid by the
 Plan Administrator may exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting
 in the acquisition of fewer common shares than if the Dividend had been paid in
 Newly Issued Common Shares on the Dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing
 difficulty with respect to Open-Market Purchases, the Plan provides that if the
 Plan Administrator is unable to invest the full Dividend amount in Open-Market Purchases
 during the purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a market premium
 during the purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease making Open-Market
 Purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the Dividend
 amount in Newly Issued Common Shares at net asset value per common share at the
 close of business on the Last Purchase Date provided that, if the net asset value
 is less than or equal to 95% of the then current market price per common share;
 the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by 95% of the market price on
 the payment date.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Plan Administrator maintains all shareholders&#146; accounts in the Plan and furnishes written confirmation of all transactions
 in the accounts, including information needed by shareholders for tax records. Common
 shares in the account of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator
 on behalf of the Plan participant, and each shareholder proxy will include those
 shares purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Administrator will forward
 all proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for shares held
 under the Plan in accordance with the instruction of the participants.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">There will be no brokerage charges with
 respect to common shares issued directly by the Fund. However, each participant
 will pay a pro rata share of brokerage commission incurred in connection with Open-Market
 Purchases. The automatic reinvestment of Dividends will not relieve participants
 of any Federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or required to be
 withheld) on such Dividends.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Fund reserves the right to amend or
 terminate the Plan. There is no direct service charge to participants with regard
 to purchases in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan
 to include a service charge payable by the participants.</font></p>
