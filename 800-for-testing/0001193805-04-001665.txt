Debt Strategies Fund, Inc.

The Benefits and Risks of Leveraging

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. utilizes leverage through borrowings or issuance of
short-term debt securities or shares of Preferred Stock. The concept of
leveraging is based on the premise that the cost of assets to be obtained from
leverage will be based on short-term interest rates, which normally will be
lower than the income earned by the Fund on its longer-term portfolio
investments. To the extent that the total assets of the Fund (including the
assets obtained from leverage) are invested in higher-yielding portfolio
investments, the Fund's Common Stock shareholders will benefit from the
incremental yield.

Leverage creates risks for holders of Common Stock including the likelihood of
greater net asset value and market price volatility. In addition, there is the
risk that fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings (or in the dividend rates
on any Preferred Stock, if the Fund were to issue Preferred Stock) may reduce
the Common Stock's yield and negatively impact its net asset value and market
price. If the income derived from securities purchased with assets received from
leverage exceeds the cost of leverage, the Fund's net income will be greater
than if leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income from the
securities purchased is not sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, the Fund's
net income will be less than if leverage had not been used, and therefore the
amount available for distribution to Common Stock shareholders will be reduced.

A Letter From the President

Dear Shareholder

In recent months, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) has taken center stage as
it shifts away from its long-accommodative monetary stance. The Fed raised the
Federal Funds rate 75 basis points (.75%) in three separate moves since June,
bringing the target short-term interest rate to 1.75% -- still low by historical
standards. The Fed has been deliberate in telegraphing its intention to take a
"measured" approach to interest rate increases in order to avoid upsetting the
economy or the financial markets, while still leaving room to move more
aggressively if inflation and economic growth accelerate more than anticipated.
The forward curve currently projects further increases in short-term interest
rates before year-end. In addition to the Fed policy change, the financial
markets recently have had to grapple with a tense geopolitical environment,
higher oil prices and the worry and anticipation that accompanies a presidential
election.

The transition to higher rates can cause concern among equity and fixed income
investors alike. For bond investors, rising interest rates means the value of
older issues declines because they bear the former lower interest rates. In
addition, increasing inflation erodes the purchasing power of fixed income
securities. Nevertheless, for the six-month and 12-month periods ended August
31, 2004, fixed income markets provided positive results. For example, the
Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index returned +1.15% and +6.13%; the Credit
Suisse First Boston High Yield Index returned +3.42% and +14.68%; and the
Citigroup Mortgage Index returned +1.79% and +6.07% for the six-month and
12-month periods, respectively.

As always, our investment professionals are closely monitoring the markets, the
economy and the overall environment in an effort to make well-informed decisions
for the portfolios they manage. Our goal is to provide shareholders with
competitive returns, while always keeping one eye on managing the unavoidable
risk inherent in investing.

We thank you for trusting Merrill Lynch Investment Managers with your investment
assets, and we look forward to serving you in the months and years ahead.

                                Sincerely,


                                /s/ Terry K. Glenn

                                Terry K. Glenn
                                President and Director

A Discussion With Your Fund's Portfolio Manager

      The Fund provided positive returns for the period, outperforming its
blended benchmark due to an overweight position in high yield bonds and our use
of leverage.

How did the Fund perform during the period in light of the existing market
conditions?

For the six-month period ended August 31, 2004, the Common Stock of Debt
Strategies Fund, Inc. had net annualized yields of 9.77% and 9.71%, based on a
period-end per share net asset value of $6.74 and a per share market price of
$6.78, respectively, and $.332 per share income dividends. Over the same period,
the total investment return on the Fund's Common Stock was +5.64%, based on a
change in per share net asset value from $6.71 to $6.74, and assuming
reinvestment of $.334 per share ordinary income dividends. The Fund's benchmark,
which is an equal blend of the Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) High Yield
Index and the CSFB Leveraged Loan Index, returned +2.85% for the same period.

For a description of the Fund's total investment return based on a change in the
per share market value of the Fund's Common Stock (as measured by the trading
price of the Fund's shares on the New York Stock Exchange), and assuming
reinvestment of dividends, please refer to the Financial Highlights section of
this report. As a closed-end fund, the Fund's shares may trade in the secondary
market at a premium or discount to the Fund's net asset value. As a result,
total investment returns based on changes in the market value of the Fund's
Common Stock can vary significantly from total investment returns based on
changes in the Fund's net asset value.

The rate of high yield bond issuance has kept pace with that of 2003, with high
yield proceeds of $66 billion in the first half of 2004 versus $68 billion in
the first half of 2003. As in 2003, this year's issuance has consisted primarily
of refinancing activity (75%), as corporate treasurers capitalized on the
relatively low interest rate environment. During this period, there was a
troublesome trend whereby companies were issuing zero-coupon debt at the holding
company to finance dividends to equity sponsors. This activity had a
"double-barreled" impact on leverage -- increasing debt while decreasing equity
- -- and often stretched credit parameters beyond reasonable limits. However, the
market eventually pushed back and we have seen this trend subside. Nevertheless,
the high yield market's risk appetite has been steadily increasing. The
percentage of transactions rated B or lower has risen from 45% in 2001 to 54% in
2002, 63% in 2003 and 68% in the first half of 2004. This trend may persist as
the forecast default rate continues to decline. Moody's Investors Service is
predicting a 2004 default rate of 2.3%, compared to 4.13% in 2003.

Technicals in the leveraged bank loan market were similar to those of the high
yield market. Refinancing accounted for 81% of bank loan issuance in the first
half of 2004, while investor demand for bank loans soared. The resulting
supply/demand imbalance prompted tighter spreads, smaller allocations and
transaction upsizing. For example, the average spread on B-rated loans
compressed from 350 basis points (3.5%) in September 2003 to 291 basis points in
August 2004.

What were the reasons for the Fund's outperformance of its benchmark?

The Fund's outperformance was driven primarily by our overweight position in
high yield bonds. We rebalanced the Fund toward fixed rate investments after the
events of September 11, 2001, as the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) cut the
Federal Funds rate from 3.5% to 1.0% by June 2003. The interest rate cuts had
dramatically reduced the yield on the LIBOR-based bank loan component of the
portfolio. (LIBOR refers to the London Interbank Offer Rate. The three-month
LIBOR is the base upon which nearly all our bank loans and floating rate notes
are set.)

Also contributing to the Fund's outperformance was our ample use of the Fund's
leverage lines. We use commercial paper-based borrowings for leverage up to a
maximum of 33% of the Fund's total assets. The average amount of Fund leverage
during the six-month period was 28.6%. (For a complete discussion of the
benefits and risk of leverage, refer to page 2 of this report to shareholders.)

Top-performing portfolio holdings during the period included High Voltage
Engineering Corporation (HVE), Vectura Group (also known as American Commercial
Lines or ACL) and Western Forest Products Inc. HVE manufactures industrial power
control systems. On March 1, 2004, HVE filed a

<PAGE>

prepackaged Chapter 11 plan whereby our $10 million bond investment would be
converted to equity. The price of this bond, which we purchased as a distressed
credit, rallied from 25 to 51 during the period after the company filed its
reorganization disclosure statement, which contained promising financial
projections.

Another distressed investment, ACL is an inland waterway barge transportation
company that filed Chapter 11 in January 2003. Our $10 million bond position
repriced from 28 to 58, owing to better operating conditions and prospects for
improved creditor recoveries.

Western Forest Products is the successor company to Doman Industries, the
Canadian paper company that emerged from Chapter 11 in July 2004. We purchased
$7.3 million (face value) worth of units, comprising 15% senior secured notes
and common shares. The value of this investment rose to $9.93 million as of
August 31, 2004, based on the prospects for much-improved profitability going
forward.

Investments that detracted from performance included Pegasus Satellite
Communications, Inc. (PGTV), New World Pasta Company (NWP) and International
Utility Structures Inc. (IUSI). Two of the Fund's holdings in Direct TV
re-marketing company PGTV collapsed during the period. Our $10 million senior
note position fell from 89 to 66, while our $3.5 million preferred position
dropped from 82 to 1. Our hopes for a favorable resolution of some longstanding
litigation issues following Newscorp's acquisition of Direct TV were not
fulfilled. PGTV filed Chapter 11 on June 2, 2004.

The Fund's $28 million distressed investment in NWP declined in price from 15 to
7 during the period. Operational difficulties, a high debt burden and sluggish
pasta sales combined to force a Chapter 11 filing in the second quarter.

IUSI is another distressed investment. We took the price of our $8 million bond
position to zero from 22 during the period. Following a bankruptcy filing by the
company, we engaged a crisis manager to help liquidate the company's two main
operations in France and Kansas. These efforts have failed, and we expect a
complete write-off here.

What changes were made to the portfolio during the period?

We continued to reposition the portfolio during the period, shifting to an
allocation of 70% fixed rate and 30% floating rate investments. This compared to
a composition of 80% fixed rate and 20% floating rate last year. Given the
robust demand for bank loans, allocations were usually a small percentage of our
original order. To achieve our 70% fixed/30% floating rate target, we purchased
$70 million in floating rate notes during the six-month period.

We continue to believe that the downside risk associated with rising interest
rates outweighs the benefits we may see from a bond rally. At period-end, the
Fed had already initiated two interest rate hikes of 25 basis points. There was
a third quarter-point increase in September, bringing the target short-term
interest rate to 1.75%. This, and the prospect of additional interest rate
hikes, served to raise the three-month LIBOR rate from 1.12% at August 31, 2003,
to 1.80% at August 31, 2004.

How would you characterize the Fund's position at the close of the period?

We would characterize our position at period-end as defensive while still
focused on maintaining the Fund's attractive yield. We also continue to be
cautious and selective in adding new positions, and intend to maintain our use
of leverage within a target range of 25% - 30% of total assets.

Notes to Financial Statements

1. Significant Accounting Policies:

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The Fund's financial statements are prepared in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which may require the use of
management accruals and estimates. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. These unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, which
are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the
results for the interim period. All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring
nature. The Fund determines and makes available for publication the net asset
value of its Common Stock on a daily basis. The Fund's Common Stock is listed on
the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol DSU.

(a) Corporate debt obligations -- The Fund invests principally in debt
obligations of companies, including Corporate Loans made by banks and other
financial institutions and both privately and publicly offered corporate bonds
and notes. Because agents and intermediaries are primarily commercial banks and
other financial institutions, the Fund's investment in Corporate Loans could be
considered concentrated in financial institutions.

(b) Valuation of investments -- Corporate Loans are valued in accordance with
guidelines established by the Board of Directors. Corporate Loans are valued at
the mean between the last available bid and asked prices from one or more
brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing Corporation. For the limited
number of Corporate Loans for which no reliable price quotes are available, such
Corporate Loans will be valued by Loan Pricing Corporation through the use of
pricing matrices to determine valuations. If the pricing service does not
provide a value for the Corporate Loan, the Investment Adviser will value the
loan at fair value, which is intended to approximate market value.

Securities that are held by the Fund that are traded on stock exchanges or the
Nasdaq National Market are valued at the last sale price or official close price
on the exchange on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business
on the day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at the last
available bid price for long positions, and at the last available ask price for
short positions. In cases where securities are traded on more than one exchange,
the securities are valued on the exchange designated as the primary market by or
under the authority of the Board of the Fund. Long positions in securities
traded in the over-the-counter ("OTC") market, Nasdaq Small Cap or Bulletin
Board are valued at the last available bid price or yield equivalent obtained
from one or more dealers or pricing services approved by the Board of Directors
of the Fund. Short positions in securities traded in the OTC market are valued
at the last available ask price. Portfolio securities that are traded both in
the OTC market and on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and
most representative market. When the Fund writes an option, the amount of the
premium received is recorded on the books of the Fund as an asset and an
equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently valued to
reflect the current market value of the option written, based on the last sale
price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded
in the OTC market, the last ask price. Options purchased by the Fund are valued
at their last sale price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case
of options traded in the OTC market, the last bid price. The value of swaps,
including interest rate swaps, caps and floors, will be determined by obtaining
dealer quotations. Other investments, including futures contracts and related
options, are stated at market value. Obligations with remaining maturities of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost unless the Investment Adviser believes
that this method no longer produces fair valuations. Repurchase agreements will
be valued at cost plus accrued interest. The Fund employs certain pricing
services to provide securities prices for the Fund. Securities and assets for
which market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Directors of the Fund,
including valuations furnished by the pricing services retained by the Fund,
which may use a matrix system for valuations. The procedures of a pricing
service and its valuations are reviewed by the officers of the Fund under the
general supervision of the Directors. Such valuations and procedures will be
reviewed periodically by the Directors.

Generally, trading in foreign securities, as well as U.S. Government securities
and money market instruments, is substantially completed each day at various
times prior to the close of business on the NYSE. The values of such securities
used in computing the net asset value of the Fund's shares are determined as of
such times. Foreign currency exchange rates also are generally determined prior
to the close of business on the NYSE. Occasionally, events affecting the values
of such securities and such exchange rates may occur between the times at which
they are determined and

the close of business on the NYSE that may not be reflected in the computation
of the Fund's net asset value. If events (for example, a company announcement,
market volatility or a natural disaster) occur during such periods that are
expected to materially affect the value of such securities, those securities may
be valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or by the Investment Adviser using a pricing service and/or procedures
approved by the Board of Directors.

(c) Derivative financial instruments -- The Fund may engage in various portfolio
investment strategies both to increase the return of the Fund and to hedge, or
protect, its exposure to interest rate movements and movements in the securities
markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of the contract or if the
counterparty does not perform under the contract.

o     Financial futures contracts -- The Fund may purchase or sell financial
      futures contracts and options on such futures contracts. Futures contracts
      are contracts for delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date
      and at a specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the Fund
      deposits and maintains as collateral such initial margin as required by
      the exchange on which the transaction is effected. Pursuant to the
      contract, the Fund agrees to receive from or pay to the broker an amount
      of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in value of the contract. Such
      receipts or payments are known as variation margin and are recorded by the
      Fund as unrealized gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Fund
      records a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value
      of the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
      closed.

o     Forward foreign exchange contracts -- The Fund may enter into forward
      foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against either specific transactions
      or portfolio positions. The contract is marked-to-market daily and the
      change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an unrealized gain or
      loss. When the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or
      loss equal to the difference between the value at the time it was opened
      and the value at the time it was closed.

o     Options -- The Fund may write covered call and put options and purchase
      call and put options. When the Fund writes an option, an amount equal to
      the premium received by the Fund is reflected as an asset and an
      equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is subsequently
      marked-to-market to reflect the current market value of the option
      written. When a security is purchased or sold through an exercise of an
      option, the related premium paid (or received) is added to (or deducted
      from) the basis of the security acquired or deducted from (or added to)
      the proceeds of the security sold. When an option expires (or the Fund
      enters into a closing transaction), the Fund realizes a gain or loss on
      the option to the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss
      to the extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid
      or received).

      Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.

o     Swaps -- The Fund may enter into swap agreements, which are
      over-the-counter contracts in which the Fund and a counterparty agree to
      make periodic net payments on a specified notional amount. The net
      payments can be made for a set period of time or may be triggered by a
      pre-determined credit event. The net periodic payments may be based on a
      fixed or variable interest rate; the change in market value of a specified
      security, basket of securities, or index; or the return generated by a
      security.

(d) Foreign currency transactions -- Transactions denominated in foreign
currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when recognized. Assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange
rate at the end of the period. Foreign currency transactions are the result of
settling (realized) or valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in
foreign currencies into U.S. dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on investments.

(e) Income taxes -- It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of
the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its shareholders.
Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Under the applicable
foreign tax law, a withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and
capital gains at various rates.

(f) Security transactions and investment income -- Security transactions are
recorded on the dates the transactions are entered into (the trade dates).
Realized gains and losses on security transactions are determined on the
identified cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend dates.


20            DEBT STRATEGIES FUND, INC.      AUGUST 31, 2004
<PAGE>

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. The Fund amortizes all
premiums and discounts on debt securities.

(g) Dividends and distributions -- Dividends from net investment income are
declared and paid monthly. Distributions of capital gains are recorded on the
ex-dividend dates.

(h) Securities lending -- The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions
that provide cash or securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government as
collateral, which will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least
100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The market value of
the loaned securities is determined at the close of business of the Fund and any
additional required collateral is delivered to the Fund on the next business
day. Where the Fund receives securities as collateral for the loaned securities,
it collects a fee from the borrower. The Fund typically receives the income on
the loaned securities but does not receive the income on the collateral. Where
the Fund receives cash collateral, it may invest such collateral and retain the
amount earned on such investment, net of any amount rebated to the borrower.
Loans of securities are terminable at any time and the borrower, after notice,
is required to return borrowed securities within five business days. The Fund
may pay reasonable finder's, lending agent, administrative and custodial fees in
connection with its loans. In the event that the borrower defaults on its
obligation to return borrowed securities because of insolvency or for any other
reason, the Fund could experience delays and costs in gaining access to the
collateral. The Fund also could suffer a loss where the value of the collateral
falls below the market value of the borrowed securities, in the event of
borrower default or in the event of losses on investments made with cash
collateral.

(i) Custodian bank -- The Fund recorded an amount payable to the custodian bank
reflecting an overnight overdraft which resulted from a failed trade.

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions with Affiliates:

The Fund has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with Fund Asset
Management, L.P. ("FAM"). The general partner of FAM is Princeton Services, Inc.
("PSI"), an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. ("ML
& Co."), which is the limited partner. FAM has entered into a Sub-Advisory
Agreement with Merrill Lynch Asset Management U.K. Limited ("MLAM U.K."), an
affiliate of FAM, pursuant to which MLAM U.K. provides investment advisory
services to FAM with respect to the Fund. There is no increase in the aggregate
fees paid by the Fund for these services.

FAM is responsible for the management of the Fund's portfolio and provides the
necessary personnel, facilities, equipment and certain other services necessary
to perform the investment advisory function. For such services, the Fund pays a
monthly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the Fund's average weekly net assets
plus the proceeds of any outstanding borrowings used for leverage.

The Fund has received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission permitting it to lend portfolio securities to Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S"), a subsidiary of ML & Co., or its
affiliates. Pursuant to that order, the Fund also has retained Merrill Lynch
Investment Managers, LLC ("MLIM, LLC"), an affiliate of FAM, as the securities
lending agent for a fee based on a share of the returns on investment of cash
collateral. MLIM, LLC may, on behalf of the Fund, invest cash collateral
received by the Fund for such loans, among other things, in a private investment
company managed by MLIM, LLC or in registered money market funds advised by FAM
or its affiliates.

In addition, MLPF&S received $2,688 in commissions on the execution of portfolio
security transactions for the Fund for the six months ended August 31, 2004.

For the six months ended August 31, 2004, the Fund reimbursed FAM $7,147 for
certain accounting services.

Certain officers and/or directors of the Fund are officers and/or directors of
FAM, MLAM U.K., PSI, and/or ML & Co.

3. Investments:

6. Short-Term Borrowings:

On May 26, 2004, the Fund renewed its $318,000,000 revolving credit and security
agreement with Citibank, N.A. and other lenders (the "Lenders"). Under the
revolving credit and security agreement, the Fund may borrow money through (i) a
line of credit from certain Lenders at the eurodollar rate plus .75% or the
highest of the Federal Funds rate plus .50%, a base rate as determined by
Citibank, N.A. and/or the latest three-week moving average of secondary market
morning offering rates in the United States for three-month certificates of
deposit of major U.S. money market banks plus .50%, or (ii) the issuance of
commercial paper notes by certain Lenders at rates of interest based upon the
weighted average of the per annum rates paid or payable by such Lenders in
respect of those commercial paper notes. As security for its obligations to the
Lenders under the revolving credit and security agreement, the Fund has granted
a security interest in substantially all of its assets to and in favor of the
Lenders. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs which includes a
commitment fee for this facility at the annual rate of .10% and a program fee of
..24% on the borrowings outstanding.

For the six months ended August 31, 2004, the average amount borrowed was

Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. seeks to provide current income by investing
primarily in a diversified portfolio of U.S. companies' debt instruments,
including corporate loans, that are rated in the lower rating categories of the
established rating services (Baa or lower by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or
BBB or lower by Standard & Poor's) or unrated debt instruments of comparable
quality.

This report, including the financial information herein, is transmitted to
shareholders of Debt Strategies Fund, Inc. for their information. It is not a
prospectus. Past performance results shown in this report should not be
considered a representation of future performance. The Fund leverages its Common
Stock to provide Common Stock shareholders with a potentially higher rate of
return. Leverage creates risk for Common Stock shareholders, including the
likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of Common
Stock shares, and the risk that fluctuations in short-term interest rates may
reduce the Common Stock's yield. Statements and other information herein are as

      5.    The Fund's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
            Fund's auditors and the audit committee of the Fund's board of

                  design or operation of internal control over financial
                  reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                  Fund's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                  financial information; and

            b)    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management
