The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund's investment objective is long-term capital
appreciation. To achieve its objective, the Fund invests in issuers that are
likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic, political, structural
and technological developments in the countries in the Caribbean Basin, which
consist of Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the Bahamas, the Dominican
Republic, Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia
and Venezuela. The fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in a broad
range of securities of issuers, including U.S.-based companies which engage in
substantial trade with, and derive substantial revenue from, operations in the
Caribbean Basin Countries.

                                                                  [PHOTO]

                                                          Chairman and President

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

Our investment strategy continues to be to invest in companies in the Caribbean
Basin which we believe will do well even if there is no change in U.S. relations
with Cuba. At the same time, when we make those investments, we try to select
companies which we believe will benefit from a resumption of trade with that
country. When the embargo is lifted, we will seek to re-deploy a substantial
part of our capital directly in Cuba.

We are pleased to report that our strategy has worked quite well. As of December
31, 2004, The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund's net assets were a record
$11,721,829 and its per share net asset value was $6.99, compared with
$8,719,841 or $5.20 per share a year earlier, representing a gain in net asset
value of +34.4% for the calendar year and +28.7% for the six month period ended
December 31, 2004. These gains follow a 52.0% gain in net asset value for the
previous calendar year. For the benefit of new shareholders, at inception our
net assets were $8,388,000 and we have paid out $2,535,847 in distributions,
resulting in a 70% gain in net asset value from inception.

Here are a few examples of some of the more interesting companies in which we
are invested which meet our two-pronged investment criteria:

Seaboard Corporation (SEB), listed on the American Stock Exchange, made a new
high last week at $1113 per share. We started accumulating our position in the
$262 per share range and added to our holding at prices as low as $227 per
share. The company is primarily a diversified international agribusiness and
transportation company, including a large fleet of containerized cargo ships
operating throughout the Caribbean. They also operate an electric utility in the
Dominican Republic.

================================================================================

Two cruise line operators, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL) and Carnival Corp.
(CCL), are also naturals for our portfolio. The companies rebounded strongly
after the 9/11 setback and have been doing very well. Indeed, just today
Carnival announced that it "expects to carry a record 3.3 million passengers and
operate an unprecedented number of voyages in the coming year." Should the
embargo be lifted, tourism will be in the forefront, and we believe that RCL and
CCL are ideally positioned for this market. Incidentally, Cuba received two
million tourists in 2004, an increase of 8% from 2003.

Perhaps the best example of our investment strategy is our largest position,
Florida East Coast Industries (FLA), which made a new high last December. This
investment has contributed significantly to the increase in the Fund's net
asset value. FLA is in both the railroad and real estate business. The company
owns the Florida East Coast Railway which is the main freight line running
between Jacksonville and Miami. We believe that when the embargo is lifted,
there will be a large increase in two-way freight traffic between Florida and
Cuba.

A different focus of our portfolio is closed-end funds--a subject on which I
have written five books. By regulation we are limited to 10% of our assets in
this category; we currently hold three positions which represent 7.47% of the
portfolio. Although Herzfeld Caribbean is a closed-end fund, many of our
investors are not familiar with the fundamentals of closed-end funds. For the
benefit of those stockholders, a closed-end fund is quite similar to a mutual
fund; one difference, however, is that the share price of a closed-end fund is
determined by supply and demand in the market place, just like any other
publicly traded stock. Its share price, therefore, can be at a premium to net
asset value when buyers dominate, or at a discount when there are more sellers.
Mutual funds' shares, on the other hand, are priced based on their net asset
value.

The three closed-end funds in our portfolio were acquired at substantial
discounts to net asset value, at levels we consider to be attractive. One of
these, Mexico Fund (MXF), which we bought at a 19% discount (before adjustment
for dilution from a rights offering), recently made a tender offer at a 1.25%
discount to net asset value. We tendered a part of our holding in exchange for
shares of Mexican companies in their portfolio. This is the second time we have
made this arbitrage in MXF. By the way, the shares of Herzfeld Caribbean are
currently changing hands at a 12% discount to net asset value, which is about
one

percentage point narrower than the average discount of the existing Latin
American and Mexican closed-end funds, but still, in our view, attractive. In
fact, I recently added to my personal position at discounts in the area of 16%.
A graph of the Herzfeld Caribbean's premium/discount from inception appears
below.

Premium/Discount

As the following graph depicts, the Fund has traded at both premiums and
discounts every year except the year of inception in which it traded only at a
premium. As I have stated before, we believe that closed-end funds trading at
discounts to net asset value represent good value.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Related Matters

The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January, 1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The Fund's investment policy is to invest at least 80% of its assets in
investments that are economically tied to Caribbean Basin Countries. The Fund's
investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The Fund
pursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked
securities of public and private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country or (ii) that have at least 50% of the value of their assets in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country. The Fund's investment objective is
fundamental and may not be changed without the approval of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities.

At December 31, 2004, the Fund had foreign investments in companies operating
principally in Mexico and the Cayman Islands, representing approximately 12.64%
and 7.75% of the Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is Investors Bank & Trust Company, based
in Boston, Massachusetts.

Security Valuation

Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported
on the NASDAQ national market or SmallCap market) are stated at the last
reported sales price on the day of valuation (or at the NASDAQ official closing
price); other securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed
securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the last
quoted bid price. Restricted securities and other securities for which
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by
the Board of Directors.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

Income Recognition

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income
is recognized on the ex-dividend date, and interest income is recognized on an
accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on debt securities purchased are amortized
over the life of the respective securities. It is the Fund's practice to include
the portion of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments
denominated in foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains
and losses on investments and foreign currency.

Deposits with Financial Institutions

The Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Income Taxes

The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,
the Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no
federal tax provision is required.

The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

Distributions to Stockholders

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. For the six months ended December 31, 2004, no
distributions were declared or paid to stockholders.

NOTE 2. NON-MARKETABLE SECURITY OWNED

Investments in securities include $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic of
Cuba bonds purchased for $63,038. The bonds are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange and had been trading in default since 1960. A "regulatory halt" on
trading was imposed by the New York Stock Exchange in July, 1995. As of December
31, 2004, the position was valued at $0 by the Board of Directors, which
approximates the bonds' fair value.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

HERZFELD / CUBA (the "Advisor"), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors,
Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual
rate of 1.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Total fees for the six
months ended December 31, 2004 amounted to $69,314.

During the six months ended December 31, 2004, the Fund paid $5,791 of brokerage
commissions to Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co., Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor.

NOTE 4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the six months ended December 31, 2004, purchases and sales of investment
securities were $1,336,394 and $1,902,247, respectively.

At December 31, 2004, the Fund's investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains
of $5,050,644 and gross unrealized losses of $767,508, resulting in a net
unrealized gain of $4,283,136 for both financial statement and income tax
purposes.

NOTE 5. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The cost of securities owned for financial statement purposes equals the cost
basis for income tax purposes.

The income tax basis of distributive earnings as of December 31, 2004, include
$1,301,069 of accumulated net investment loss, $375,582 of accumulated net
realized gain on investments and $4,283,136 of net unrealized gain on
investments.

For the six months ended December 31, 2004, the Fund had net realized gains of
$646,615, which could, if unchanged, utilize the remaining capital loss
carryforward of $605,664 in the current fiscal year. Any net capital gain in
excess of the capital loss carryforward, which expires in the tax year ended
June 30, 2008, are anticipated to be distributed in accordance with Sub-chapter
M of the Internal Revenue Code.
