R. JAY GERKEN, CFA
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Dear Shareholder,

I am pleased to report that your fund, the Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc.,
generated favorable relative returns both on a net asset value ("NAV")/i/ and
market price basis for the six months ended November 30, 2003. The fund's total
return based on its market price during this period was 6.32%, while its NAV
return was 5.84%. The fund outperformed the Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond
Index,/ii/ which returned 0.19% as well as its Lipper general municipal debt
(leveraged) closed-end funds category average, which returned 1.21% for the
same period./iii/ Certain investors may be subject to the federal Alternative
Minimum Tax, and state and local taxes will apply. Capital gains, if any, are
fully taxable. Please consult your personal tax adviser.

This positive performance occurred within a sea change for bonds. After a
formidable run, bonds lost some of the gains they had generated earlier in the
year as signs of a sharp pick-up in the pace of economic growth and rising
long-term Treasury bond yields dealt a blow to the market. Furthermore, many
municipalities continued to grapple with serious budgetary pressures brought on
by the weak economy among other fiscal factors. As a result, your fund manager
took a cautious stance, maintaining a focus on revenue bonds, which are backed
by the generally stable revenue streams of specific public works (such as
bridge tolls) and de-emphasizing state general obligation (GO) bonds, which
have become relatively less favorable given the uncertain budget scenarios.

During the six months, the fund distributed dividends to shareholders totaling
$0.35 per share. The table shows the annualized distribution yields and six-

month total return based on the fund's November 30, 2003 NAV per share and its
New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") closing price. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.


                   FUND PERFORMANCE AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2003

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
                                    Annualized      Six-Month
                Price Per Share Distribution Yield Total Return
                <S>             <C>                <C>
                 $12.12 (NAV)         5.74%           5.84%
                 $11.32 (NYSE)        6.15%           6.32%
</TABLE>

   Total returns are based on changes in NAV or market price, respectively.
   Total return assumes the reinvestment of all dividends and/or capital gains
   distributions in additional shares. Annualized distribution yield is the
   fund's current monthly income dividend rate, annualized and then divided by
   the NAV or the market price noted in this report. The annualized
   distribution yield assumes a current monthly income dividend rate of $0.058
   for 12 months. This rate is as of November 30, 2003 and is subject to change.


In this environment of bond volatility marred by budget deficits, it is
critical to perform a thorough analysis before carefully choosing municipal
bonds. In our opinion, this is all the more reason why investing in municipal
bonds with a professional fund manager is a more prudent strategy than buying
these bonds directly. Fund managers can provide the diversification and
thorough credit analysis that is so important in managing risk.

Special Shareholder Notice

It is with great sadness that we bring to your attention the passing of Alfred
J. Bianchetti, Director Emeritus, and James J. Crisona, Director Emeritus, of
the fund. Messrs. Bianchetti and Crisona, who both passed away on September
4th, lived accomplished lives to the ages of 80 and 97, respectively. We will
sorely miss their presence and will remember the dedicated service they
provided to the fund's shareholders through their outstanding contributions as
long-term members of the Board.

Looking for Additional Information?

The fund is traded under the symbol "MMU" and its closing market price is
available in most newspapers under the New York Stock Exchange listings. The
daily NAV is available online under symbol XMMUX. Barron's and The Wall Street
Journal's Monday editions carry closed-end fund tables that will provide
additional information. In addition, the fund issues a quarterly allocation
press release that can be found on most major financial web sites.

In a continuing effort to provide information concerning the fund, shareholders
may call 1-888-735-6507, Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.
Eastern Time, for the fund's current net asset value, market price and other
information regarding the fund's portfolio holdings and allocations.

Information About Your Fund

In recent months several issues in the mutual fund industry have come under the
scrutiny of federal and state regulators. The fund's Adviser and some of its
affiliates have received requests for information from various government
regulators regarding market timing, late trading, fees and other mutual fund
issues in connection with various investigations. The fund has been informed
that the Adviser and its affiliates are responding to those information
requests, but are not in a position to predict the outcome of these requests
and investigations.

As always, thank you for your continued confidence in our stewardship of your
assets.

Sincerely,

/s/ R. Jay Gerken

The information provided is not intended to be a forecast of future events, a
guarantee of future results or investment advice. Views expressed may differ
from those of the firm as a whole.

Portfolio holdings and breakdowns are as of November 30, 2003 and are subject
to change. Please refer to pages 5 through 19 for a list and percentage
breakdown of the fund's holdings.

All index performance reflects no deduction for fees, expenses or taxes.

/i/   NAV is a price that reflects the value of the fund's underlying portfolio
      plus other assets, less the fund's liabilities. However, the price at
      which an investor may buy or sell shares of the fund is at the fund's
      market price as determined by supply of and demand for the fund's common
      shares which may be more or less than the fund's NAV.
/ii/  The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is a broad measure of the
      municipal bond market with maturities of at least one year. Please note
      that an investor cannot invest directly in an index.
/iii/ Lipper Inc. is a major independent mutual-fund tracking organization.
      Returns are based on the six-month period ended November 30, 2003,
      calculated among 64 funds in the fund's Lipper category including the
      reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any.

Take Advantage of the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan!
As an investor in the Fund, you can participate in its Dividend Reinvestment
Plan ("Plan"), a convenient, simple and efficient way to reinvest your
dividends and capital gains, if any, in additional shares of the Fund. Below is
a short summary of how the Plan works.

Plan Summary
If you are a Plan participant who has not elected to receive your dividends in
the form of a cash payment, then your dividend and capital gain distributions
will be reinvested automatically in additional shares of the Fund.

The number of shares of common stock in the Fund you will receive in lieu of a
cash dividend is determined in the following manner. If the market price of the
common stock is equal to or exceeds 98% of the net asset value per share
("NAV") on the determination date, you will be issued shares by the Fund at a
price reflecting the NAV, or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.

If the market price is less than 98% of the NAV at the time of valuation (the
close of business on the determination date), PFPC Inc. ("Plan Agent"), will
buy common stock for your account in the open market.

If the Plan Agent begins to purchase additional shares in the open market and
the market price of the shares subsequently rises above the previously
determined NAV before the purchases are completed, the Plan Agent will attempt
to terminate purchases and have the Fund issue the remaining dividend or
distribution in shares at the greater of the previously determined NAV or 95%
of the market price. In that case, the number of Fund shares you receive will
be based on the weighted average of prices paid for shares purchased in the
open market and the price at which the Fund issues the remaining shares.

A more complete description of the current Plan appears in this report
beginning on page 35.

To find more detailed information about the Plan and about how you can
participate, please call the Plan Agent at 1 (800) 331-1710.

                                 BOND RATINGS
                                  (unaudited)



The definitions of the applicable rating symbols are set forth below:

Standard & Poor's Ratings Service ("Standard & Poor's") -- Ratings from "AA" to
"CCC" may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show
relative standings within the major rating categories.

<TABLE>
<C>    <S>
AAA    --Bonds rated "AAA" have the highest rating assigned by Standard &
         Poor's. Capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely
         strong.
AA     --Bonds rated "AA" have a very strong capacity to pay interest and
         repay principal and differ from the highest rated issue only in a
         small degree.
A      --Bonds rated "A" have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay
         principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the
         adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions
         than debt in higher rated categories.
BBB    --Bonds rated "BBB" are regarded as having an adequate capacity to
         pay interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit
         adequate protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or
         changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
         capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this
         category than in higher rated categories.
BB, B, --Bonds rated "BB", "B", "CCC" and "CC" are regarded, on balance, as
CCC      predominantly speculative with respect to capacity to pay interest
and CC   and repay principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation.
         "BB" represents a lower degree of speculation than "B", and "CC"
         the highest degree of speculation. While such bonds will likely
         have some quality and protective characteristics, these are
         outweighed by large uncertainties or major risk exposures to
         adverse conditions.

Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") -- Numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 may
be applied to eachgeneric rating from "Aa" to "Ba," where 1 is the highest
and 3 the lowest ranking within itsgeneric category.

Aaa    --Bonds rated "Aaa" are judged to be of the best quality. They carry
         the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred
         to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by
         an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the
         various protective elements are likely to change, such changes as
         can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally
         strong position of such issues.
Aa     --Bonds rated "Aa" are judged to be of high quality by all standards.
         Together with the "Aaa" group they comprise what are generally
         known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds
         because margins of protection may not be as large in "Aaa"
         securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater
         amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the
         long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in "Aaa" securities.
A      --Bonds rated "A" possess many favorable investment attributes and
         are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors
         giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate
         but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to
         impairment some time in the future.
Baa    --Bonds rated "Baa" are considered as medium grade obligations, i.e.,
         they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest
         payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but
         certain protective elements may be lacking or may be
         characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such
         bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have
         speculative characteristics as well.
Ba     --Bonds rated "Ba" are judged to have speculative elements; their
         future cannot be considered as well assured. Often the protection
         of interest and principal payments may be very moderate and thereby
         not well safeguarded during both good and bad times over the
         future. Uncertainty of position characterizes bonds in this class.

NR     --Indicates that the bond is not rated by Standard & Poor's or
         Moody's.

<C>    <S>
SP-1   --Standard & Poor's highest rating indicating very strong or strong
         capacity to pay principal and interest; those issues determined to
         possess overwhelming safety characteristics are denoted with a plus
         (+) sign.
A-1    --Standard & Poor's highest commercial paper and variable-rate demand
         obligation (VRDO) rating indicating that the degree of safety
         regarding timely payment is either overwhelming or very strong;
         those issues determined to possess overwhelming safety
         characteristics are denoted with a plus (+) sign.
VMIG 1 --Moody's highest rating for issues having a demand feature -- VRDO.
P-1    --Moody's highest rating for commercial paper and for VRDO prior to

   1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Managed Municipals Portfolio Inc. ("Fund"), a Maryland corporation, is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.

   The significant accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund are:
(a) security transactions are accounted for on trade date; (b) securities are
valued at the mean between bid and asked prices provided by an independent
pricing service that are based on transactions in municipal obligations,
quotations from municipal bond dealers, market transactions in comparable
securities and various relationships between securities; (c) securities for
which market quotations are not available will be valued in good faith at fair
value by or under the direction of the Board of Directors; (d) securities
maturing within 60 days or less are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or
minus amortized premium, which approximates value; (e) gains or losses on sale
of securities are calculated by using the specific identification method; (f)
interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of
discount, is recorded on an accrual basis; (g) dividends and distributions to
shareholders are recorded monthly by the Fund on the ex-dividend date for the
shareholders of Common Stock. The holders of the Auction Rate Cumulative
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive dividends in accordance with an
auction that will normally be held weekly and out of funds legally available to
shareholders; (h) the net asset value of the Fund's Common Stock is determined
no less frequently than the close of business on the Fund's last business day
of each week (generally Friday). It is determined by dividing the value of the
net assets available to Common Stock by the total number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding. For the purpose of determining the net asset value per share
of the Common Stock, the value of the Fund's net assets shall be deemed to
equal the value of the Fund's assets less (1) the Fund's liabilities, (2) the
aggregate liquidation value (i.e., $25,000 per outstanding share) of the
Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock and (3) accumulated and unpaid
dividends on the outstanding Auction Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock issue; (i)
the Fund intends to comply with the applicable provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, pertaining to regulated investment companies
and to make distributions of taxable income sufficient to relieve it from
substantially all Federal income and excise taxes; (j) the character of income
and gains to be distributed is determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America; and (k) estimates and assumptions are required to
be made regarding assets, liabilities and changes in net assets resulting from
operations when financial statements are prepared.


                                   [GRAPHIC]

Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters
used in determining these estimates could cause actual results to differ.

   2. EXEMPT-INTEREST DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS

   The Fund intends to satisfy conditions that will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular Federal income tax and from
designated state income taxes, to retain such tax-exempt status when
distributed to the shareholders of the Fund.

   Capital gain distributions, if any, are taxable to shareholders, and are
declared and paid at least annually.

   3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT AND OTHER
      TRANSACTIONS


   Smith Barney Fund Management LLC ("SBFM"), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citigroup Inc. ("Citigroup"), acts as the investment adviser and
administrator to the Fund. For investment advisory and administrative services,
the Fund pays SBFM fees calculated at the annual rate of 0.70% and 0.20% of the
average daily total net assets of the Fund, respectively, for an aggregate
investment advisory and administrative fee of 0.90%. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, by agreement between SBFM and the Fund, the Fund pays SBFM an
aggregate investment advisory and administrative fee at an annual rate of 0.65%
on those assets of the Fund equal to the product of the number of preferred
shares outstanding multiplied by the liquidation value of such shares. The
investment advisory fee and the administrative fee are each calculated daily
and paid monthly.

   Effective September 1, 2003, the aggregate investment advisory and
administrative fee rate of 0.90% described above was reduced to an aggregate
fee of 0.75%, composed of investment advisory and administrative fees
calculated at the annual rate of 0.55% and 0.20% of the average daily total net
assets of the Fund, respectively. The investment advisory and administrative
fees are otherwise calculated as described in the above paragraph.

   All officers and one Director of the Fund are employees of Citigroup or its
affiliates.

   4. INVESTMENTS

   During the six months ended November 30, 2003, the aggregate cost of
purchases and proceeds from sales of investments (including maturities of
long-term investments, but excluding short-term investments) were as follows:

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Purchases                                                         $171,698,526
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sales                                                              197,486,189
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

   At November 30, 2003, aggregate gross unrealized appreciation and
depreciation of investments for Federal income tax purposes were substantially
as follows:

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gross unrealized appreciation                                     $ 40,914,047
Gross unrealized depreciation                                      (21,511,090)
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net unrealized appreciation                                       $ 19,402,957
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   5. FUTURES CONTRACTS

   Securities or cash equal to the initial margin amount are either deposited
with the broker or segregated by the custodian upon entering into the futures
contracts. Additional securities are also segregated up to the current market
value of the futures contracts. During the period the futures contract is open,
changes in the value of the contract are recognized as unrealized gains or
losses by "marking-to-market" on a daily basis to reflect the market value of
the contract at the end of each day's trading. Variation margin payments are
received or made and recognized as assets due from or liabilities due to
broker, depending upon whether unrealized gains or losses are incurred. When
the contract is closed, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the
difference between the proceeds from (or cost of) the closing transactions and
the Fund's basis in the contract. The Fund enters into such contracts typically
to hedge a portion of its portfolio. The Fund bears the market risk that arises
from changes in the value of the financial instruments and securities indices.

   At November 30, 2003, the Fund had the following open futures contracts:

                   Number of               Basis        Market     Unrealized
                   Contracts Expiration    Value        Value         Loss

   6. AUCTION RATE CUMULATIVE PREFERRED STOCK

   As of November 30, 2003, the Fund had 2,000 outstanding shares of Series M,
Series T, Series W, Series Th and Series F, respectively, of Auction Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock ("ARCPS"). Additional offering costs of $71,209 were
incurred and recorded as a reduction of the capital paid in excess of par value
of common stock for the year ended May 31, 2003. The ARCPS' dividends are
cumulative at a rate determined at an auction and the dividend period is
typically 7 days. The dividend rates ranged from 0.60% to 1.15% during the six
months ended November 30, 2003. At November 30, 2003, the current dividend
rates were as follows:

                         Series M Series T Series W Series Th Series F
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Current Dividend Rates    0.98%    1.00%    1.02%     1.03%    1.03%
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------

   The ARCPS are redeemable under certain conditions by the Fund, or subject to
mandatory redemption (if the Fund is in default of certain coverage
requirements) at a redemption price equal to $25,000 per share plus accumulated
and unpaid dividends. ARCPS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share
plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

   The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverages with respect to the
ARCPS. If the Fund fails to maintain these coverages and does not cure any such
failure within the required time period, the Fund is required to redeem a
requisite number of the ARCPS in order to meet the applicable requirement.
Additionally, failure to meet the foregoing asset requirements would restrict
the Fund's ability to pay dividends to common stock shareholders.

   Citigroup Global Markets Inc. ("CGM"), another indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Citigroup, currently acts as a broker/dealer in connection with
the auction of ARCPS. After each auction, the auction agent will pay to each
participating broker/dealer, from monies the Fund provides, a participation fee
at the annual rate of 0.25% of the purchase price of the ARCPS that the
broker/dealer places at the auction. For the six months ended November 30,
2003, CGM earned $313,580 as a participating broker/dealer.

   7. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

   The Fund has received the following information from Citigroup Asset
Management ("CAM"), the Citigroup business unit which includes the Fund's
Investment Manager and other investment advisory companies, all of which are
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Citigroup. CAM is reviewing its entry,
through an affiliate, into the transfer agent business in the period 1997-1999.
As CAM currently understands the facts, at the time CAM decided to enter the
transfer agent business, CAM sub-contracted for a period of five years certain
of the transfer agency services to a third party and also concluded a revenue
guarantee agreement with this sub-contractor providing that the sub-contractor
would guarantee certain benefits to CAM or its affiliates (the "Revenue
Guarantee Agreement"). In connection with the subsequent purchase of the
sub-contractor's business by an affiliate of the current sub-transfer agent
(PFPC Inc.) used by CAM on many of the funds it manages, this Revenue Guarantee
Agreement was amended eliminating those benefits in exchange for arrangements
that included a one-time payment from the sub-contractor.

   The Boards of CAM-managed funds (the "Boards") were not informed of the
Revenue Guarantee Agreement with the sub-contractor at the time the Boards
considered and approved the transfer agent arrangements. Nor were the Boards
informed of the subsequent amendment to the Revenue Guarantee Agreement when
that occurred.

   CAM has begun to take corrective actions. CAM will pay to the applicable
funds $16 million (plus interest) that CAM and its affiliates received from the
Revenue Guarantee Agreement and its amendment. CAM also plans an independent
review to verify that the transfer agency fees charged by CAM were fairly
priced as compared to competitive alternatives. CAM is instituting new
procedures and making changes designed to ensure no similar arrangements are
entered into in the future.

   CAM has briefed the SEC, the New York State Attorney General and other
regulators with respect to this matter, as well as the U.S. Attorney who is
investigating the matter. CAM is cooperating with governmental authorities on
this matter, the ultimate outcome of which is not yet determinable.

   The Fund's transfer agent is PFPC Inc., which is not affiliated with CAM.

(2) The investment adviser and/or administrator waived a portion of its fees
    for the years ended May 31, 2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999. If such fees had not
    been waived, the per share decreases to net investment income and actual

(3) Effective June 1, 2001, the Fund adopted a change in the accounting method
    that requires the Fund to amortize premiums and accrete all discounts.
    Without the adoption of this change, for the year ended May 31, 2002, the
    ratio of net investment income to average net assets would have been 4.81%.
    Per share information, ratios and supplemental data for the periods prior
    to June 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in
    presentation. In addition, the impact of this change to net investment
    income and net realized and unrealized gain was less than $0.01 per share.
(4) The total return calculation assumes that dividends are reinvested in
    accordance with the Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Performance figures
    may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Past performance is
    no guarantee of future results. In the absence of fee waivers and/or
    expense reimbursements, the total return would be reduced.
(5) Calculated on basis of average net assets of common shareholders. Ratios do
    not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.
(6) On May 22, 2002, the Fund issued 2,000 shares of Auction Rate Cumulative
    Preferred Stock at $25,000 a share, for Series M, Series T, Series W,
    Series Th and Series F, respectively.
(7) Excludes accumulated undeclared dividends.

                          DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
                                  (unaudited)


   Under the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("Plan"), a shareholder whose
shares of common stock are registered in his own name will have all
distributions from the Fund reinvested automatically by PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), as
purchasing agent under the Plan, unless the shareholder elects to receive cash.
Distributions with respect to shares registered in the name of a broker-dealer
or other nominee (that is, in street name) will be reinvested by the broker or
nominee in additional shares under the Plan, unless the service is not provided
by the broker or nominee or the shareholder elects to receive distributions in
cash. Investors who own common stock registered in street name should consult
their broker-dealers for details regarding reinvestment. All distributions to
shareholders who do not participate in the Plan will be paid by check mailed
directly to the record holder by or under the direction of PFPC as dividend
paying agent.

   The number of shares of common stock distributed to participants in the Plan
in lieu of a cash dividend is determined in the following manner. When the
market price of the common stock is equal to or exceeds 98% of the net asset
value per share of the common stock on the determination date (generally, the
record date for the distribution), Plan participants will be issued shares of
common stock by the Fund at a price equal to the greater of net asset value
determined as described below under "Net Asset Value" or 95% of the market
price of the common stock.

   If the market price of the common stock is less than 98% of the net asset
value of the common stock at the time of valuation (which is the close of
business on the determination date), PFPC will buy common stock in the open
market, on the NYSE or elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. If following
the commencement of the purchases and before PFPC has completed its purchases,
the market price exceeds the net asset value of the common stock as of the
valuation time, PFPC will attempt to terminate purchases in the open market and
cause the Fund to issue the remaining portion of the dividend or distribution
in shares at a price equal to the greater of (a) net asset value as of the
valuation time or (b) 95% of the then current market price. In this case, the
number of shares received by a Plan participant will be based on the weighted
average of prices paid for shares purchased in the open market and the price at
which the Fund issues the remaining shares. To the extent PFPC is unable to
stop open market purchases and cause the Fund to issue the remaining shares,
the average per share purchase price paid by PFPC may exceed the net asset
value of the common stock as of the valuation time, resulting in the
acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or capital gains distribution
had been paid in common stock issued by the Fund at such net asset value. PFPC
will begin to purchase common stock on the open market as

                          DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
                            (unaudited) (continued)


soon as practicable after the determination date for the dividend or capital
gains distribution, but in no event shall such purchases continue later than 30
days after the payment date for such dividend or distribution, or the record
date for a succeeding dividend or distribution, except when necessary to comply
with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.

   PFPC maintains all shareholder accounts in the Plan and furnishes written
confirmations of all transactions in each account, including information needed
by a shareholder for personal and tax records. The automatic reinvestment of
dividends and capital gains distributions will not relieve Plan participants of
any income tax that may be payable on the dividends or capital gains
distributions. Common stock in the account of each Plan participant will be
held by PFPC in uncertificated form in the name of the Plan participant.

   Plan participants are subject to no charge for reinvesting dividends and
capital gains distributions under the Plan. PFPC's fees for handling the
reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions will be paid by the
Fund. No brokerage charges apply with respect to shares of common stock issued
directly by the Fund under the Plan. Each Plan participant will, however, bear
a proportionate share of any brokerage commissions actually incurred with
respect to any open market purchases made under the Plan.

   Experience under the Plan may indicate that changes to it are desirable. The
Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan as applied to any
dividend or capital gains distribution paid subsequent to written notice of the
change sent to participants at least 30 days before the record date for the
dividend or capital gains distribution. The Plan also may be amended or
terminated by PFPC, with the Fund's prior written consent, on at least 30 days'
written notice to Plan participants. All correspondence concerning the plan
should be directed by mail to PFPC Inc., P.O. Box 8030, Boston, Massachusetts
02266-8030 or by telephone at 1 (800) 331-1710.

                                  (unaudited)


   Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, that from time to time the Fund may purchase
shares of its common stock in the open market.

         ("Citigroup"). Along with the other investment advisers that comprise
         CAM, the Manager has adopted a set of proxy voting policies and
         procedures (the "Policies") to ensure that the Manager votes proxies
         relating to equity securities in the best interest of clients.

         In voting proxies, the Manager is guided by general fiduciary
         principles and seeks to act prudently and solely in the best interest
         of clients. The Manager attempts to consider all factors that could
         affect the value of the investment and will vote proxies in the manner
         that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
         shareholder values. The Manager may utilize an external service
         provider to provide it with information and/or a recommendation with
         regard to proxy votes. However, such recommendations do not relieve the
         Manager of its responsibility for the proxy vote.

         In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a stated position in
         the Policies, CAM generally votes in accordance with such stated
         position. In the case of a proxy issue for which there is a list of
         factors set forth in the Policies that CAM considers in voting on such
         issue, CAM votes on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the general
         principles set forth above and considering such enumerated factors. In
         the case of a proxy issue for which there is no stated position or list
         of factors that CAM considers in voting on such issue, CAM votes on a
         case-by-case basis in accordance with the general principles set forth
         above. Issues for which there is a stated position set forth in the
         Policies or for which there is a list of factors set forth in the
         Policies that CAM considers in voting on such issues fall into a
         variety of categories, including election of directors, ratification of
         auditors, proxy and tender offer defenses, capital structure issues,
         executive and director

<PAGE>

         compensation, mergers and corporate restructurings, and social and
         environmental issues. The stated position on an issue set forth in the
         Policies can always be superseded, subject to the duty to act solely in
         the best interest of the beneficial owners of accounts, by the
         investment management professionals responsible for the account whose
         shares are being voted. Issues applicable to a particular industry may
         cause CAM to abandon a policy that would have otherwise applied to
         issuers generally. As a result of the independent investment advisory
         services provided by distinct CAM business units, there may be
         occasions when different business units or different portfolio managers
         within the same business unit vote differently on the same issue.

         In furtherance of the Manager's goal to vote proxies in the best
         interest of clients, the Manager follows procedures designed to
         identify and address material conflicts that may arise between the
         Manager's interests and those of its clients before voting proxies on
         behalf of such clients. To seek to identify conflicts of interest, CAM
         periodically notifies CAM employees (including employees of the
         Manager) in writing that they are under an obligation (i) to be aware
         of the potential for conflicts of interest with respect to voting
         proxies on behalf of client accounts both as a result of their personal
         relationships and due to special circumstances that may arise during
         the conduct of CAM's and the Manager's business, and (ii) to bring
         conflicts of interest of which they become aware to the attention of
         compliance personnel. The Manager also maintains and considers a list
         of significant relationships that could present a conflict of interest
         for the Manager in voting proxies. The Manager is also sensitive to the
         fact that a significant, publicized relationship between an issuer and
         a non-CAM affiliate might appear to the public to influence the manner
         in which the Manager decides to vote a proxy with respect to such
         issuer. Absent special circumstances or a significant, publicized
         non-CAM affiliate relationship that CAM or the Manager for prudential
         reasons treats as a potential conflict of interest because such
         relationship might appear to the public to influence the manner in
         which the Manager decides to vote a proxy, the Manager generally takes
         the position that non-CAM relationships between Citigroup and an issuer
         (e.g. investment banking or banking) do not present a conflict of
         interest for the Manager in voting proxies with respect to such issuer.
         Such position is based on the fact that the Manager is operated as an
         independent business unit from other Citigroup business units as well
         as on the existence of information barriers between the Manager and
         certain other Citigroup business units.

         CAM maintains a Proxy Voting Committee, of which the Manager personnel
         are members, to review and address conflicts of interest brought to its
         attention by compliance personnel. A proxy issue that will be voted in
         accordance with a stated position on an issue or in accordance with the
         recommendation of an independent third party is not brought to the
         attention of the Proxy Voting Committee for a conflict of interest
         review because the Manager's position is that to the extent a conflict
         of interest issue exists, it is resolved by voting in accordance with a
         pre-determined policy or in accordance with the recommendation of an
         independent third party. With respect to a conflict of interest brought
         to its attention, the

<PAGE>

         Proxy Voting Committee first determines whether such conflict of
         interest is material. A conflict of interest is considered material to
         the extent that it is determined that such conflict is likely to
         influence, or appear to influence, the Manager's decision-making in
         voting proxies. If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that
         a conflict of interest is not material, the Manager may vote proxies
         notwithstanding the existence of the conflict.

         If it is determined by the Proxy Voting Committee that a conflict of
         interest is material, the Proxy Voting Committee is responsible for
         determining an appropriate method to resolve such conflict of interest
         before the proxy affected by the conflict of interest is voted. Such
         determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances,
         including the importance of the proxy issue and the nature of the
         conflict of interest. Methods of resolving a material conflict of
         interest may include, but are not limited to, disclosing the conflict
         to clients and obtaining their consent before voting, or suggesting to
         clients that they engage another party to vote the proxy on their
         behalf.
