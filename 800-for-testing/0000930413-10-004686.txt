NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1.    ORGANIZATION

            Advantage   Advisers  Xanthus  Fund,   L.L.C.  (the  "Company")  was
            organized as a limited  liability company under the laws of Delaware
            in January  1999.  The Company is  registered  under the  Investment
            Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended  (the  "Act"),  as a  closed-end,
            non-diversified management investment company. The Company's term is
            perpetual unless the Company is otherwise terminated under the terms
            of the Limited Liability Company Agreement dated as of June 5, 2003.
            The Company's  investment  objective is to achieve  maximum  capital
            appreciation.  From the  inception of the  Company,  through July 1,
            2010, the Company pursued its investment objective by investing in a
            portfolio  consisting  primarily of equity  securities of technology
            companies  that derive a major portion of their revenue  directly or
            indirectly  from  business  lines that  benefit  from  technological
            events or  advances.  Commencing  on July 1,  2010,  the  investment
            program was updated to focus on investing in a portfolio  consisting
            generally of equity  securities  that the Adviser  believes are well
            positioned  to benefit  from demand for their  products or services,
            particularly companies that can innovate or grow rapidly relative to
            their peers in their markets.  These type of companies are generally
            considered  to be "growth  companies."  The  Company's  portfolio of
            securities is expected to include long and short positions primarily
            in  equity  securities  of  U.S.  and  non-U.S.   companies.  Equity
            securities  include common and preferred stock and other  securities
            having   equity   characteristics,    including   convertible   debt
            securities,  stock options, warrants and rights. The Adviser may use
            total return swaps to gain long or short investment exposure in lieu
            of purchasing or selling an equity security directly.

            Responsibility  for the overall  management  and  supervision of the
            operations of the Company is vested in the  individuals who serve as
            the Board of  Managers of the  Company  (the  "Board of  Managers").
            There  are six  members  of the  Board of  Managers,  one of whom is
            considered  an  "interested  person"  under the Act.  The  Company's
            investment  adviser is  Advantage  Advisers  Management,  L.L.C.,  a
            Delaware limited liability company (the "Adviser"). The Adviser is a
            subsidiary  of  Oppenheimer  Asset  Management  Inc.  ("OAM") and an
            affiliate of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. ("Oppenheimer").  The Adviser is
            responsible  for  managing  the  Company's   investment   activities
            pursuant to an investment advisory agreement dated June 5, 2003. OAM
            is the managing member of the Adviser, and Alkeon Capital Management
            L.L.C.   ("Alkeon")  is  a  non-managing   member  of  the  Adviser.
            Investment  professionals  employed by Alkeon,  including  Mr. Takis
            Sparaggis, who serves as the Company's portfolio manager, manage the
            Company's  portfolio on behalf of the Adviser under the  supervision
            of OAM. Oppenheimer has a minority profit participation  interest in
            Alkeon.

            The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions from Members
            is subject to  approval  by the Board of  Managers.  The Company may
            from time to time offer to repurchase  interests pursuant to written
            tenders by Members.  Such repurchases will be made at such times and
            on such terms as may be determined by the Board of Managers,  in its
            complete  and  exclusive   discretion.   The  Adviser  expects  that
            generally  it will  recommend  to the  Board  of  Managers  that the
            Company offer to repurchase  interests from Members twice each year,
            effective at the end of the second  fiscal  quarter and again at the
            end of the  year.  Prior  to  making  the  change  in the  Company's
            investment program,  the Company made a tender offer with respect to
            100% of the Company's assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2010 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      1.    ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

            Generally,  except as provided under  applicable law, a Member shall
            not be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations and liabilities
            in any  amount in  excess of the  capital  account  balance  of such
            Member,  plus  such  Member's  share of  undistributed  profits  and
            assets.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

            In June 2009,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  ("FASB")
            issued THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  CODIFICATION AND THE HIERARCHY
            OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED  PRINCIPLES.  The standard identifies the FASB
            Accounting   Standards   Codification   as  the  single   source  of
            authoritative U.S. accounting and reporting standards applicable for
            all non-governmental entities, with the exception of guidance issued
            by the SEC and its staff.  It is effective for financial  statements
            issued for interim and fiscal years ending on or after September 15,
            2009. The Company is in conformity with the standard.

            The  preparation  of financial  statements in  conformity  with U.S.
            generally accepted accounting  principles  (hereafter referred to as
            "authoritative guidance") requires the Adviser to make estimates and
            assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in the  financial
            statements and  accompanying  notes.  The Adviser  believes that the
            estimates utilized in preparing the Company's  financial  statements
            are  reasonable  and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ
            from these estimates.

            The following is a summary of the Company's accounting policies:

            A.    REVENUE RECOGNITION

            Securities transactions, including related revenue and expenses, are
            recorded on a trade-date  basis,  and  dividends are recorded on the
            ex-dividend  date,  net of applicable  withholding  taxes.  Interest
            income and expense are recorded on the accrual  basis.  Premiums and
            discounts  on  fixed  income  securities  are  amortized  using  the
            effective interest rate method.

            B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

            The Company's securities are valued at fair value in accordance with
            policies  adopted  by the Board of  Managers,  which are  summarized
            below.

            (i)   Domestic  exchange traded  securities  (other than options and
                  those securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

                  (1)   at their last composite sale price as reported on the
                        exchanges where those securities are traded; or

            B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

                  (2)   if no sales of those securities are reported on a
                        particular day, the securities are valued based upon
                        their composite bid price for securities held long, or
                        their composite asked price for securities sold, not yet
                        purchased, as reported by those exchanges.

            (ii)  Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

                  (1)   at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP") (which is
                        the last trade price at or before 4:00 p.m. (Eastern
                        Time) adjusted up to NASDAQ's best offer price if the
                        last traded price is below such bid and down to NASDAQ's
                        best offer price if the last trade is above such offer
                        price); or

                  (2)   if no NOCP is available at the last sale price on the
                        NASDAQ prior to the calculation of the net asset value
                        of the Company; or

                  (3)   if no sale is shown on NASDAQ at the bid price; or

                  (4)   if no sale is shown and no bid price is available, the
                        price will be deemed "stale" and the value will be
                        determined in accordance with the fair valuation
                        procedures set forth herein.

            Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange  are valued at
            their last sale price on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are
            primarily  traded,  or  in  the  absence  of a  reported  sale  on a
            particular  day, at their bid price (in the case of securities  held
            long)  or  asked  price  (in the case of  securities  sold,  not yet
            purchased) as reported by such  exchange.  Listed options are valued
            at their bid price  (or  asked  price in the case of listed  written
            options) as reported by the exchange with the highest  volume on the
            last day a trade was  reported.  Other  securities  for which market
            quotations  are readily  available are valued at their bid price (or
            asked price in the case of securities  sold,  not yet  purchased) as
            obtained  from  one  or  more  dealers   making  markets  for  those
            securities. If market quotations are not readily available, the fair
            value of the  securities  and other  assets are  determined  in good
            faith by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

            Foreign-denominated  assets may  involve  more  risks than  domestic
            transactions,  including political,  economic,  and regulatory risk.
            Risks may also arise from the potential  inability of a counterparty
            to meet the terms of a contract and from unanticipated  movements in
            the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

            Securities  associated  with swaps are valued in accordance with the
            procedures  described above,  net of any contractual  terms with the
            counterparty.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

            B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

            Debt  securities  are  valued  in  accordance  with  the  procedures
            described  above,  which with respect to such securities may include
            the use of valuations furnished by a pricing service which employs a
            matrix to determine valuation for normal  institutional size trading
            units or consultation  with brokers and dealers in such  securities.
            The Board of Managers will periodically  monitor the  reasonableness
            of valuations provided by any such pricing service.  Debt securities
            with  remaining  maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent unusual
            circumstances,  be  valued  at  amortized  cost,  so  long  as  such
            valuation is determined  by the Board of Managers to represent  fair
            value.

            All assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies
            are  converted  into  U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
            provided by a pricing service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m. London time.
            Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values
            of such securities are determined,  prior to the close of securities
            markets in the U.S. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior
            to such  close.  On  occasion,  the  values of such  securities  and
            exchange rates may be affected by events occurring  between the time
            such values or exchange  rates are  determined and the time that the
            net asset  value of the  Company  is  determined.  When such  events
            materially  affect the values of  securities  held by the Company or
            its liabilities,  such securities and liabilities are fair valued as
            determined in good faith by, or under the  supervision of, the Board
            of Managers.

            The determination of fair value shall take into account the relevant
            factors and surrounding  circumstances,  which may include:  (i) the
            nature  and  pricing  history  (if  any) of the  security  or  other
            investment;  (ii) whether any dealer quotations are available; (iii)
            possible  valuation  methodologies  that could be used to  determine
            fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation of the Adviser with respect to
            the valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar  securities or other
            investments are held by other accounts or other funds managed by the
            Adviser and the  valuation  method used by the Adviser  with respect
            thereto;  (vi) the extent to which the fair  value to be  determined
            will  result  from  the use of data or  formulae  produced  by third
            parties  independent  of the  Adviser;  and (vii) the  liquidity  or
            illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

            The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities which qualify
            as financial instruments approximates the carrying amounts presented
            in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

            During the six months  ended,  June 30, 2010,  the Company  followed
            authoritative  guidance  for fair value  measurement.  The  guidance
            establishes a framework for measuring fair value and a hierarchy for
            inputs  used in  measuring  fair  value  that  maximizes  the use of
            observable  inputs and minimizes the use of  unobservable  inputs by
            requiring that the most  observable  inputs be used when  available.
            The guidance  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to
            measure fair value.

            B.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

            Various  inputs are used in  determining  the value of the Company's
            investments.  These inputs are  summarized in the three broad levels
            listed below.

            Level 1 -- observable  market  inputs  that  are  unadjusted  quoted
            prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.

            Level 2 -- other  significant  observable  inputs  (including quoted
            prices for similar securities,  interest rates,  prepayments speeds,
            credit risk, etc.).

            Level 3 -- significant  unobservable inputs (including the Company's
            own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments).

            The  inputs  or  methodology  used for  valuing  securities  are not
            necessarily an indication of the risk  associated  with investing in
            these securities.

            Additional  information  on  the  investments  can be  found  in the
            Schedule of Portfolio Investments,  the Schedule of Securities Sold,
            Not Yet Purchased and the Schedule of Swap Contracts.

            The  following is a summary of the inputs used, as of June 30, 2010,
            in valuing the Company's investments at fair value.

      2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

            C.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

            The Company  treats all highly  liquid  financial  instruments  that
            mature  within  three  months  at  the  time  of  purchase  as  cash
            equivalents.  Restricted Cash represents funds held by the Custodian
            for securities held as collateral. At June 30, 2010, $167,937,443 in
            cash equivalents was held at PNC Bank in a money market account,  as
            well as, foreign currency with a U.S. Dollar value of $4,246,977 was
            held at PFPC Trust Company.

            D.    INCOME TAXES

            The  Company  has  reclassified  $15,379,828  and  $30,565,615  from
            accumulated net investment loss and accumulated net realized gain on
            investments,  respectively,  to net capital contributions during the
            year ended December 31, 2009. This  reclassification was a result of
            permanent book to tax  differences  to reflect,  as an adjustment to
            net  capital  contributions,  the  amounts of  taxable  loss and net
            realized  gain  on  investments  that  have  been  allocated  to the
            Company's Members and had no effect on net assets.

            In accordance with authoritative  guidance,  Management has analyzed
            the  Company's  tax position for all open tax years (tax years ended
            December  31,  2006-2009),  and has  concluded  that a liability  of
            $3,142,315  capital  gain  country tax is required in the  Company's
            financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties,
            if any,  related to country  tax  expense  within the  Statement  of
            Operations.  During  the  period,  the  Company  did not  record any
            interest or penalties.

            Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return
            its distributive share of the Company's taxable income or loss.

      3.    ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

            Oppenheimer provides certain administrative  services to the Company
            including,  among other  things,  providing  office  space and other
            support  services.  In exchange for such services,  the Company pays
            Oppenheimer  a  monthly  administration  fee of  0.08333%  (1% on an
            annualized  basis) of the Company's net assets  determined as of the
            beginning of the month.

            During  the six  months  ended  June 30,  2010,  Oppenheimer  earned
            $52,176  as  brokerage   commissions  from  portfolio   transactions
            executed  on  behalf  of the  Company.  Mainsail  Group,  L.L.C.,  a
            broker-dealer  affiliate  of Alkeon,  earned  $796,906 as  brokerage
            commissions  from portfolio  transactions  executed on behalf of the
            Company.

      3.    ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

            Net profits or net losses of the Company for each fiscal  period are
            allocated  among and  credited  to or debited  against  the  capital
            accounts of all Members (but not the Special  Advisory Member) as of
            the last day of each  fiscal  period  in  accordance  with  Members'
            respective  investment   percentages  for  the  fiscal  period.  The
            Adviser,  in its  capacity  as the  Special  Advisory  Member of the
            Company,  is  entitled  to  receive  an  incentive  allocation  (the
            "Incentive  Allocation"),  charged  to the  capital  account of each
            Member as of the last day of each allocation  period,  of 20% of the
            amount by which net profits,  if any, exceed the positive balance in
            the Member's  "loss recovery  account." The Incentive  Allocation is
            credited to the Special Advisory Account of the Adviser. By the last
            business day of the month  following  the date on which an Incentive
            Allocation  is made,  the  Adviser  may  withdraw  up to 100% of the
            Incentive  Allocation  that was  credited  to the  Special  Advisory
            Account with respect to the allocation period. During the six months
            ended June 30, 2010, an Incentive Allocation of $781 was credited to
            the Special  Advisory  Member's  capital account and was included in
            withdrawals  payable at June 30, 2010,  in the  Statement of Assets,
            Liabilities and Members' Capital.

            Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a "Manager")  who is not
            an  "interested  person"  of the  Company,  as  defined  by the Act,
            receives an annual  retainer of $15,000  plus a fee for each meeting
            attended.  The Lead  Independent  Manager and the Chair of the Audit
            Committee  receive a supplemental  retainer of $7,500 and $3,750 per
            annum,  respectively.  Managers who are "interested  persons" do not
            receive any annual or other fee from the  Company.  Managers who are
            not  "interested  persons"  are  reimbursed  by the  Company for all
            reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by them in  performing
            their duties.

            PFPC Trust  Company  (the  "Custodian")  serves as  custodian of the
            Company's assets.

            PNC  Global  Investment  Servicing  Inc.  (now  known as BNY  Mellon
            Investment  Servicing (USA) Inc. ("BNY Mellon"))  serves as investor
            services and  accounting  agent to the Company and in that  capacity
            provides  certain  accounting,  recordkeeping  and investor  related
            services.  The Company  pays BNY Mellon an  accounting  and investor
            services  fee  based  primarily  on the  average  net  assets of the
            Company as of the last day of each month,  payable monthly,  subject
            to a minimum annual fee.

            Oppenheimer  acts  as the  non-exclusive  placement  agent  for  the
            Company,  without special  compensation from the Company,  and bears
            costs  associated with its activities as placement  agent.  However,
            the placement  agent is entitled to charge a sales  commission of up
            to 3% (up to 3.1%  of the  amount  invested)  in  connection  with a
            purchase of interests,  at its discretion.  For the six months ended
            June 30, 2010, such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted
            to $435,287.

      4.    INDEMNIFICATIONS

            The Company has entered into several  contracts that contain routine
            indemnification  clauses. The Company's maximum exposure under these
            arrangements  is unknown,  as this would involve  future claims that
            may be made against the Company that have not yet occurred. However,
            based on  experience,  the  Company  expects  the risk of loss to be
            remote.

      5.    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

            Aggregate  purchases and sales of investment  securities,  excluding
            short-term  securities,  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2010,
            amounted to $889,664,931 and $854,072,605,  respectively.  Aggregate
            purchases and sales of securities sold, not yet purchased, excluding
            short-term  securities,  for the six  months  ended  June 30,  2010,
            amounted to $498,263,312 and $666,545,492, respectively.

            At December  31, 2009,  the  aggregate  cost for Federal  income tax
            purposes  of  portfolio   investments,   securities  sold,  not  yet
            purchased, and purchased options was $822,081,478,  $380,009,544 and
            $8,200,049, respectively.

            For Federal income tax purposes,  at December 31, 2009,  accumulated
            net unrealized gain on portfolio  investments,  securities sold, not
            yet purchased, and purchased options was $133,011,400, consisting of
            $184,011,861  gross unrealized gain and $51,000,461 gross unrealized
            loss.

            Due from broker primarily  represents proceeds from securities sold,
            not yet purchased,  net of excess cash,  held at the prime broker as
            of June 30, 2010, and is used as collateral for securities sold, not
            yet purchased.

      6.    SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

            The Company has the ability to trade on margin and borrow funds from
            brokers  and  banks  for  investment  purposes.  Trading  in  equity
            securities   on  margin   involves  an  initial   cash   requirement
            representing  at least 50% of the underlying  security's  value with
            respect to transactions in U.S. markets and varying percentages with
            respect to  transactions  in foreign  markets.  The Act requires the
            Company  to  satisfy an asset  coverage  requirement  of 300% of its
            indebtedness,  including amounts borrowed,  measured at the time the
            Company  incurs the  indebtedness.  The  Company  pays  interest  on
            outstanding  margin  borrowings at an annualized  rate of LIBOR plus
            0.875%.  The Company pledges securities as collateral for the margin
            borrowings, which are maintained in a segregated account held by the
            Custodian. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, the average daily
            amount of such  borrowings  was  $2,995,897  and the daily  weighted
            average  annualized   interest  rate  was  0.55%.  The  Company  had
            borrowings   outstanding  at  June  30,  2010,  totaling  $3,445,644
            recorded as due to broker on the  Statement  of Assets,  Liabilities
            and Members' Capital.

      7.    FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS
            OF CREDIT RISK

            In the normal  course of  business,  the Company  may trade  various
            financial  instruments and enter into various investment  activities
            with  off-balance  sheet risk. These financial  instruments  include
            options,  swaps and securities  sold, not yet purchased.  Generally,
            these financial instruments represent future commitments to purchase
            or sell other  financial  instruments at specific terms at specified
            future dates. Each of these financial  instruments  contains varying
            degrees  of  off-balance  sheet risk  whereby  changes in the market
            value of the securities  underlying the financial instruments may be
            in excess of the  amounts  recognized  in the  Statement  of Assets,
            Liabilities and Members' Capital.

            The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times,
            may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced
            any losses in such  accounts  and does not  believe it is exposed to
            any significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

            Securities  sold,  not yet purchased  represent  obligations  of the
            Company  to  deliver  specified  securities  and  thereby  creates a
            liability to purchase  such  securities  in the market at prevailing
            prices. Accordingly,  these transactions result in off-balance sheet
            risk as the  Company's  ultimate  obligation  to satisfy the sale of
            securities  sold, not yet purchased may exceed the amount  indicated
            in the  Statement  of  Assets,  Liabilities  and  Members'  Capital.
            Primarily all investments in securities  sold, not yet purchased and
            due from broker are positions  with, and amounts due from, the prime
            broker, Morgan Stanley. Accordingly, the Company has a concentration
            of individual  counterparty  credit risk with the prime broker.  The
            Company pledges securities in an account at PFPC Trust Company,  for
            the benefit of the prime broker,  to meet the margin  requirement as
            determined by the prime broker.

            A swap is a contract  under which two parties agree to make periodic
            payments to each other based on specified  interest  rates, an index
            or the value of some  other  instrument,  applied  to a  stated,  or
            "notional"  amount.  Swaps  generally  can be classified as interest
            rate swaps,  currency  swaps,  commodity swaps or equity swaps which
            can also include contracts for difference,  depending on the type of
            index or instrument used to calculate the payments. Such swaps would
            increase  or  decrease  the  Company's  investment  exposure  to the
            particular  interest rate,  currency,  commodity or equity involved.
            Securities  associated with swaps are marked-to-market  based on the
            Company's  valuation  procedures  that are outlined in Section 2b of
            these notes.  The change in value of swaps,  including  the periodic
            amounts of interest to be paid or received on swaps,  is reported as
            unrealized  gains or  losses in the  Statement  of  Operations.  Net
            unrealized gains are reported as an asset and net unrealized  losses
            are reported as a liability on the Statement of Assets,  Liabilities
            and  Members' Capital. A  realized  gain or loss  is  recorded  upon
            payment  or receipt of a  periodic  payment or  termination  of swap
            agreements.

            Most  swap  agreements  entered  into  by the  Company  require  the
            calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a
            "net basis."  Consequently,  current obligations (or rights) under a
            swap agreement  generally will be equal to only the net amount to be
            paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of
            the  positions  held  by  each  party  to the  agreement  (the  "net
            amount").

      7.    FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS
            OF CREDIT RISK (CONTINUED)

            The Company is subject to the market risk associated with changes in
            the value of the  underlying  investment or  instrument,  as well as
            exposure to credit risk associated with counterparty non-performance
            on swap contracts. The risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited
            to the net amount of  payments  that the  Company  is  contractually
            obligated  to  make.  If the  other  party to a swap  defaults,  the
            Company's  risk of loss  consists of the net amount of payments that
            the Company  contractually  is  entitled  to  receive,  which may be
            different  than the  amounts  recorded on the  Statement  of Assets,
            Liabilities and Members' Capital.

            The unrealized  appreciation/depreciation,  rather than the notional
            amount,  represents  the  approximate  future cash to be received or
            paid, respectively.

            The Company may write (sell) put and call options on  securities  or
            derivative  instruments  in order  to gain  exposure  to or  protect
            against changes in the markets.

            The risk  associated  with  purchasing an option is that the Company
            pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally,
            the  Company  bears the risk of loss of premium and change in market
            value should the  counterparty  not perform under the contract.  Put
            and call options  purchased  are accounted for in the same manner as
            investment  securities.   The  average  quarterly  market  value  of
            purchased  options was  $4,730,617  during the six months ended June
            30, 2010 which is  indicative of the volume of activity of purchased
            options.  The swap  contracts  that are presented in the Schedule of
            Swap  Contracts are  representative  of the volume of the derivative
            activity during the six months ended June 30, 2010.

            When the  Company  writes an option,  the  premium  received  by the
            Company is recorded as a liability and is  subsequently  adjusted to
            the current  market value of the option  written.  If a written call
            option is  exercised,  the premium is added to the proceeds from the
            sale of the underlying  security in determining  whether the Company
            has realized a gain or loss.  If a written put option is  exercised,
            the premium  reduces the cost basis of the  securities  purchased by
            the Company. In writing an option, the Company bears the market risk
            of an  unfavorable  change  in the  price of the  security  or index
            underlying  the written  option.  Exercise of a written  option by a
            counterparty  could  result  in the  Company  selling  or  buying  a
            security at a price different from the current market value.  During
            for  the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2010,  the  Company  had no
            transactions in written options.

            The Company  follows  authoritative  guidance on  disclosures  about
            derivative   instruments  and  hedging   activities.   Authoritative
            guidance  requires  qualitative  disclosures  about  objectives  and
            strategies for using  derivatives,  quantitative  disclosures  about
            fair value amounts of gains and losses on derivative instruments and
            disclosures  about   credit-risk-related   contingent   features  in
            derivative agreements.  All accounting policies and disclosures have
            been made in accordance with authoritative

III.  APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

At a meeting  held on March 24, 2010,  the Board of Managers of the Company (the
"Board") completed its annual consideration of, and approved the renewal of, the
Company's investment advisory agreement with the Adviser.

In  approving  the  renewal of the  investment  advisory  agreement,  the Board,
including each of the Independent  Managers,  reviewed various written materials
provided  by the  Adviser  at the  request  of the Board and  assessed:  (i) the
nature,  extent and quality of the services  provided to the  Company;  (ii) the
investment  performance of the Company relative to other comparable funds; (iii)
advisory  fees and  other  fees  and  expenses  of the  Company  (including  fee
information for comparable funds) and the profitability of the Adviser; (iv) the
extent to which  economies  of scale would be realized as the  Company's  assets
under management increase;  and (v) whether advisory fee levels reflect any such
economies  of scale for the benefit of  investors.  The Board also  approved the
renewal  of the  administrative  services  agreement  between  the  Company  and
Oppenheimer,  an affiliate of the Adviser, which provides certain administrative
services to the Company.

In  considering  the nature,  extent and  quality of  services  that the Adviser
provides  to the  Company,  the Board  reviewed  presentations  from  management
relating to staffing, management and the organizational structure of the various
departments of  Oppenheimer  providing  services to the Company.  The Board also
reviewed with management the investment management, compliance, regulatory, risk
management,  administration,  accounting,  infrastructure  and investor services
provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer  and reviewed the costs  associated with
providing these services.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Independent  Managers had, over the previous twelve months,  also considered
various matters,  including:  Oppenheimer's commitment to the advisory business,
including the  alternative  investment  advisory  business,  and its platform of
proprietary products; the research and portfolio management  capabilities of the
personnel  responsible for managing the Company's assets; the appropriateness of
the Adviser's staffing levels and the commitment of resources to fund accounting
and  administration,   shareholder  services  and  regulatory  compliance;   the
Adviser's oversight of third party service providers;  the Company's  investment
performance  and the  profitability  of the Adviser  attributable  to  providing
services to the Company, among other matters.

Based on its review,  the Board  concluded  that the Company  benefits  from the
services provided by the Adviser,  including  research and portfolio  management
services and also  benefits  from the  administrative  services  and  compliance
infrastructure  provided  by the Adviser  and  Oppenheimer.  The Board noted its
overall satisfaction with the nature, extent and quality of services provided by
the Adviser and concluded  that the Company was receiving the services  required
from the Adviser under its agreement  with the Company,  and that these services
were of appropriate quality.

The  Board  also  reviewed  materials  relating  to  the  Company's   investment
performance  on a  quarterly  basis.  The Board also  considered  the  Company's
historical investment performance, including a comparison of such performance to
the  performance  of similar  funds and relevant  indices.  The consensus of the
Board was that during the past year the  investment  performance  of the Company
was competitive  with its peers. The indirect  benefits  received by the Adviser
and its affiliates  attributable to its  relationships  to the Company also were
considered.

The Board also  considered the advisory fees and current and historical  expense
ratios of the Company for the services  provided by the Adviser and  Oppenheimer
under the investment  advisory agreement and administrative  services agreement,
respectively.   The  Independent  Managers  concluded  that  the  fees  paid  to
Oppenheimer  and the Adviser were  reasonable  and  appropriate  and were within
industry norms, based on the comparisons to similar funds. In particular,  a fee
comparison  showed  that  the  fees  charged  -- a 1.0%  management  fee and 20%
incentive allocation -- were at the mid-to-lower end of fees charged for similar
products.  In this regard, the Board reviewed a comparison of the Company's fees
to those of comparable  registered  funds, and concluded that the Company's fees
are  similar to those of the other  funds.  The Board also  considered  revenues
received by the Adviser and Oppenheimer from the Company,  including  management
fees, incentive allocations and investment income, as well as data regarding the
Adviser's financial condition, compensation and profitability, including related
direct and indirect operating expenses relating to the Company, payments made to
registered representatives of Oppenheimer for services they provide to investors
and   marketing   and  sales   expenses.   The  Board   noted  that   registered
representatives  of  Oppenheimer  continue  to  be  paid  out  of  Oppenheimer's
resources  for providing  various  investor  services.  The Board noted that the
Adviser had not realized  significant  profits during the previous year from its
relationship with the Company but continues to be willing to manage the Company.
The Adviser reviewed with the Board the methodology used to estimate these costs
and profits of the Adviser, as set forth in the profitability materials provided
by management.  It also considered the indirect benefits received by the Adviser
and its affiliates attributable to their relationships to the Company.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (CONCLUDED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on its review of  information  relating to the Company's fees and expenses
and the  profitability  of the Adviser and its  affiliates,  the Board concluded
that  the  Company's   fees  under  the   investment   advisory   agreement  and
administrative services agreement bear a reasonable relationship to the services
provided by the Adviser and Oppenheimer.

With respect to whether the Company  benefits  from  economies of scale in costs
associated  with  services  provided to the Company,  the Board  concluded  that
material economies of scale are not being realized at current asset levels.

Based on the  considerations  described  above,  the following  conclusions  and
determinations  were  made  by the  Board,  including  all  of  the  Independent
Managers:

      1.    the  nature,  extent and  quality of the  services  provided  by the
            Adviser were adequate and appropriate;

      2.    the fees paid to the  Adviser and  Oppenheimer  are  reasonable  and
            appropriate  in  light  of  both  comparative  fee  information  and
            benefits  to be derived by the Adviser  and  Oppenheimer  from their
            relationships with the Company;

      3.    the  Adviser's  fees are  reasonable  in light of the advisory  fees
            charged by the Adviser (and other affiliates) and other unaffiliated
            investment advisers to similar investment vehicles receiving similar
            services  and in light  of the fact  that,  absent  any  performance
            allocation,  the expenses  associated with providing services to the
            Company had exceeded in the past, and may exceed in the future,  the
            fees payable by the Company;

      4.    material economies of scale are not being realized by the Adviser or
            Oppenheimer at current asset levels.

      5.    the  approval of the renewal of the  Company's  investment  advisory
            agreement and  administrative  services  agreement for an additional
            annual  period  is in the  best  interests  of the  Company  and its
            Members.
