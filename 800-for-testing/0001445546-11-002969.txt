                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and their respective representatives, taking into
account the information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements
include all statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact.
For example, forward-looking statements include the use of words such as
"anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may,"
"should," "would" or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or
outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of certain other risks of investing in the
Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The risks of investing in the Fund are

report and other Fund regulatory filings.

                                   COMMENTARY

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund
II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its
objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior loans. There can be no
assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may
not be appropriate for all investors.

MARKET RECAP

The senior loan market provided relatively strong returns over the twelve-month
reporting period. For the full-year period, the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index
(the "Index") (broad-based senior loan market index) returned 9.28%. The
reporting period began on a negative note (June 2010 index return was -0.47%)
due to potential sovereign risk in Europe, particularly Greece, which led to a
flight to quality. Since that time, the senior loan market has generally risen,
benefiting from improving credit quality and strong demand for the asset class.

A look at the default rate in the market provides a view to the improving credit
conditions over the reporting period. The default rate has steadily moved lower
throughout the reporting period. In June 2010, the trailing twelve-month default
rate stood at 4.02%; it declined to 0.91% as of May 2011. This puts the current
default rate well inside the historic average 3.66% default level for the
market. The date range for the historic average default rate is December
1998-May 2011. As this data suggests, corporate performance has generally
improved, with issuers showing the ability to grow revenues and cash flows in
recent periods.

Alongside improving credit conditions, we have seen demand increase for the
asset class, which has benefited secondary loan prices. A major factor regarding
demand has been the significant increase in retail senior loan mutual fund
flows. For the calendar year to date period, retail senior loan funds have taken
in $22.7 billion in new investor dollars. This compares to $4.4 billion over the
same five-month period in 2010. Retail investors are drawn to the potentially
attractive income and interest rate protection that these funds may offer. Along
with the increase in demand, the volume of new loan issuance has also increased
over the period with an impressive $25 billion in new loan issuance in the month
of May 2011 alone.


                                                                          Page 3

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2011


Overall, the combination of improving credit conditions and strong investor
demand provided an environment for impressive returns over the period. Average
loan prices in the market have improved 5 points, from 90.4 cents on the dollar
at the beginning of the period to 95.4 cents on the dollar at the end of May
2011. With the increase in loan prices, the discounted spread of loans in the
market has tightened over the period. In June 2010, the discounted spread to a
three-year average life was 6.70%; it has declined steadily to 5.21% at the end
of May 2011.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

For the twelve-month period ended May 31, 2011, the Fund generated a market
price total return of 23.20% and a net asset value (NAV) total return of 11.19%.
The Fund's market price return increased in the period as the market price began
the period trading at a -9.38% discount to NAV and improved to a +0.41% premium
to NAV at the end of the period.

From an income standpoint, the Fund increased the monthly distribution rate six
times over the twelve-month period. The Fund paid $0.039 cents per share in June
2010, and through the dividend increases, it paid $0.07 cents per share in May
2011. This equates to a 79% increase in the level of monthly distributions over
the period. These increases were made possible in part through a higher level of
coupons paid by holdings within the Fund. At the end of May 2011, the Fund's
distribution rate at NAV was 5.69% (5.67% at market price).

The Fund's NAV return for the period of 11.19% outperformed the S&P/LSTA
Leveraged Loan Index return of 9.28% by 191 basis points. While the Fund's
higher credit quality bias relative to the index detracted from returns in the
period (as lower quality loans generally outperformed), the Fund benefited from
the use of leverage over the period as loan prices increased.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK

The First Trust Leveraged Finance Team believes that the senior loan market will
continue to benefit from the favorable market conditions that exist today.
Credit quality is likely to remain strong and we expect default rates to remain
at a modest level in the periods ahead. Strong demand for senior loans may
continue as investors seek the potential benefits of current income and
protection from rising interest rates (senior loans may benefit from rising
rates due to the fact they pay a floating interest rate). The combination of a
modest default rate and a supportive technical environment should provide a
positive backdrop for senior loan returns.

We believe the Fund is positioned well to benefit in what we expect to be a
positive environment for the asset class in the periods ahead. Through our
rigorous credit research, we seek to identify the best relative value
opportunities in the market as potential holdings for the Fund. The portfolio
construction process balances the goals of a high current income with portfolio
risk. In order to mitigate risk, we expect that the portfolio will remain well
diversified and maintain a higher average credit quality than the market as
represented by the Index. With loan prices trading, on average, below par,
defaults at a modest level, and credit quality generally strong, we believe
investors with an intermediate-time horizon will be rewarded by investing in the
senior loan asset class, as current market conditions appear to offer investors
a compelling value.

(d)   Senior Loans in which the Fund invests pay interest at rates which are
      periodically predetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
      premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
      offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
      Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more United
      States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Certain Senior
      Loans are subject to a LIBOR floor that establishes a minimum base LIBOR
      rate.

(e)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(f)   This Senior Loan Interest was privately rated upon issuance. The rating
      agency does not provide ongoing surveillance on the rating.

(g)   Interest for the period commencing on November 30, 2009 and ending on
      December 31, 2011 shall be payable, at the Borrowers' option, (i) in cash
      at a rate per annum equal to 9% ("Cash Interest") or (ii) in
      Payment-in-Kind interest at a rate per annum equal to 11%. Commencing on
      January 1, 2012, interest shall be payable as Cash Interest.

(h)   This security is fair valued in accordance with procedures adopted by the
      Fund's Board of Trustees.

(i)   This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(j)   This security is restricted and cannot be offered for public sale without
      first being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Prior
      to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions
      exempt from registration (See Note 1 D - Restricted Investments in the
      Notes to Financial Statements).

(k)   This security is a Senior Subordinated Payment-in-Kind Election Note
      whereby 1.00% of interest per annum will be paid in cash and 13.75% of
      interest per annum shall be paid by the issuer, at its option (i) entirely
      in cash, (ii) entirely in Payment-in-Kind interest or (iii) in a
      combination thereof. Interest is to be paid semi-annually; however, the
      issuer is in default and income is not being accrued.

(l)   Non-income producing security.

(m)   Aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes is $573,989,886. As of May
      31, 2011, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all investments
      in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $4,153,529 and the
      aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all investments in which there
      was an excess of tax cost over value was $6,142,878.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2011


                              1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (formerly known as First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II) (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans")1. There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily in accordance with valuation procedures
adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with provisions of
the 1940 Act. The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and
sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions
that function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market,
although typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having
grown substantially since its inception, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the fair value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by a third party pricing service. The third party
pricing service primarily uses broker quotes to value the Senior Loans.

Common stocks and other securities listed on any national or foreign exchange
(excluding the NASDAQ National Market ("NASDAQ") and the London Stock Exchange
Alternative Investment Market ("AIM") are valued at the last sale price on the
exchange on which they are principally traded. If there are no transactions on
the valuation day, the securities are valued at the mean between the most recent
bid and asked prices. Securities listed on the NASDAQ or the AIM are valued at
the official closing price. If there is no official closing price on the
valuation day, the securities are valued at the mean between the most recent bid
and asked prices. Securities traded in the over-the-counter market are valued at
their closing bid prices.

Debt securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less when purchased
are valued at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts.

In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation, or the valuations received are deemed
unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities.
Additionally, if events occur after the close of the principal markets for
certain securities (e.g., domestic debt securities and foreign securities) that
could materially affect the Fund's NAV, First Trust may use a fair value method
to value the Fund's securities. The use of fair value pricing is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act. As a general principle, the fair value of a
security is the amount which the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for the
security upon its current sale. However, in light of the judgment involved in
fair valuations, there can be no assurance that a fair value assigned to a
particular security will be the amount which the Fund might be able to receive
upon its current sale. Fair valuation of a security is based on the
consideration of all available information, including, but not limited to, the
following:

 1)   the fundamental business data relating to the issuer;

 2)   an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which these
      securities are purchased and sold;

 3)   the type, size and cost of the security;

 4)   the financial statements of the issuer;

 5)   the credit quality and cash flow of the issuer, based on the Advisor's or
      external analysis;

 6)   the information as to any transactions in or offers for the security;

 7)   the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or equity
      securities) of the issuer/borrower, or comparable companies;

 8)   the coupon payments;

 9)   the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing the
      security;

10)   the business prospects of the issuer, including any ability to obtain
      money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an assessment of the
      issuer's management;

11)   the prospects for the issuer's industry, and multiples (of earnings and/or
      cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in that industry; and

12)   other relevant factors.


The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical securities. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the security occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

      o     Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar securities in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar securities in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the security, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  security (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            security.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing portfolio investments are not
necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those
investments. A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's portfolio
investments as of May 31, 2011 is included with the Fund's Portfolio of
Investments.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued or delayed-delivery or forward purchase commitments.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had unfunded delayed draw loan commitments of
$5,736,114 as of May 31, 2011.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"). Prior to registration, restricted
securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from registration under
Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified institutional buyers. As of
May 31, 2011, the Fund held restricted securities as shown in the following
table. The Fund does not have the right to demand that such securities be

(1)   Security was acquired through a restructuring that was effective on July
      31, 2007.

E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically adjusted
for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character. These
permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income and
gain/loss on portfolio securities held by the Fund and have no impact on net
assets or net asset value per share. Temporary differences, which arise from
recognizing certain items of income, expense and gain/loss in different periods
for financial statement and tax purposes, will reverse at some time in the
future. Permanent differences incurred during the year ended May 31, 2011,
resulting in book and tax accounting differences, have been reclassified at year
end to reflect an increase in accumulated net investment income (loss) of
$236,586, a decrease in accumulated net realized gain (loss) on investments of
$246,403 and an increase to paid-in capital of $9,817. Net assets were not
affected by these reclassifications.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2011 and 2010 is as follows:

                 Distributions paid from:            2011              2010
                                                -------------      ------------
                 Ordinary income.............   $  17,618,839      $ 11,164,283

As of May 31, 2011, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:

                 Undistributed ordinary income.................. $    1,062,013
                 Undistributed capital gains....................             --
                                                                 --------------
                 Total undistributed earnings...................      1,062,013
                 Accumulated capital and other losses...........   (106,300,083)
                 Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation).....     (1,989,349)
                                                                 --------------
                 Total accumulated earnings (losses)............   (107,227,419)
                 Other..........................................             --
                 Paid-in capital................................    481,129,548
                                                                 --------------
                 Net assets..................................... $  373,902,129
                                                                 ==============

F. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes.


                                                                         Page 23

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2011


The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws, which
allow it to carry realized capital losses forward for eight years following the
year of loss and offset such loss against any future realized capital gains. The
Fund is subject to certain limitations under U.S. tax rules on the use of
capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These limitations
apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership. At May 31, 2011, the Fund
had a capital loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of $106,124,058,
expiring as follows:

         EXPIRATION DATE             AMOUNT
         May 31, 2014         $   3,984,460
         May 31, 2016         $   3,611,723
         May 31, 2017         $  25,585,953
         May 31, 2018         $  68,278,827
         May 31, 2019         $   4,663,095

Certain losses realized after October 31 may be deferred and treated as
occurring on the first day of the following fiscal year. For the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2011, the Fund intends to elect to defer net realized losses
incurred between November 1, 2010 and May 31, 2011 of $176,025.

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ending 2008, 2009,
2010 and 2011 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31, 2011,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

On December 22, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Regulated Investment
Company Modernization Act of 2010 effective for tax years beginning after
December 22, 2010. Management is currently evaluating the impact the Act will
have on future financial statements, if any.

G. EXPENSES:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

H. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT:

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2010-06 "Improving Disclosures about
Fair Value Measurements." ASU 2010-06 amends FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to require
additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Certain disclosures
required by ASU No. 2010-06 are effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2010, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Management
is currently evaluating the impact ASU No. 2010-06 will have on the Fund's
financial statement disclosures, if any. All other disclosures required by ASU
2010-06 were adopted on June 1, 2010 and are reflected in the financial
statements and footnotes.

 3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited partnership with
one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one general partner, The
Charger Corporation. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of
the Fund's investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and
providing certain administrative services necessary for the management of the
Fund. For these investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a
monthly fee calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets
(the average daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's
liabilities other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also
provides fund reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount
of $9,250.

Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners") served as the Fund's
investment sub-advisor and managed the Fund's portfolio subject to First Trust's
supervision until October 12, 2010. Four Corners received an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that was paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

James A. Bowen, the President of First Trust, on October 12, 2010, acquired 100%
of the voting stock of The Charger Corporation, the general partner of First
Trust (the "Transaction"). The consummation of the Transaction was deemed to be
an "assignment" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund's investment management
agreement and investment sub-advisory agreement and resulted in the automatic
termination of the agreements. The Transaction did not impact the day-to-day
operations of the Fund.

The Board of Trustees of the Fund approved an interim investment management
agreement with First Trust which was entered into effective upon the closing of
the Transaction and would be in effect for a maximum period of 150 days absent
shareholder approval. A new investment management agreement with First Trust was
approved by the Board of Trustees of the Fund and was submitted to shareholders

of the Fund as of the record date (September 30, 2010) for approval to take
effect upon such shareholder approval. An annual shareholder meeting of the Fund
to vote on a proposal to approve the new investment management agreement was
held on December 20, 2010, at which time the new investment management agreement
was approved by the Fund's shareholders. Until December 20, 2010, advisory fees
payable to First Trust were held in escrow. See Submission of Matters to a Vote
of Shareholders, in the Additional Information section of this report, for the
results.

Also, effective October 12, 2010, the Leveraged Finance Investment Team of First
Trust assumed the day-to-day responsibility for management of the Fund's
portfolio. Additionally, effective October 12, 2010, the Fund's name was changed
from First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II to "First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II." The Fund continues to trade under
the same ticker symbol "FCT."

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (formerly PNC Global Investment
Servicing (U.S.) Inc.) serves as the Fund's Administrator, Fund Accountant and
Transfer Agent in accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company,
which was renamed BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company effective July
1, 2011, serves as the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee
arrangements.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustee") is paid an annual retainer of
$10,000 per trust for the first 14 trusts of the First Trust Fund Complex and an
annual retainer of $7,500 per trust for each subsequent trust in the First Trust
Fund Complex. The annual retainer is allocated equally among each of the trusts.
No additional meeting fees are paid in connection with Board or Committee
meetings.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $10,000 annually, the
Chairman of the Audit Committee is paid $5,000 annually, and each of the
Chairmen of the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Valuation Committee
is paid $2,500 annually to serve in such capacities, with such compensation paid
by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex and divided among those trusts.
Trustees are also reimbursed by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex for
travel and out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. The Lead
Independent Trustee and each Committee Chairman will serve two-year terms before
rotating to serve as Chairman of another committee or as Lead Independent
Trustee. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no compensation from the
Fund for serving in such capacities.

                     4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 were $539,574,942 and
$505,103,416, respectively.

                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund has entered into a Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") with
various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be used as
leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of May 9, 2012
and may be renewed annually. The Credit Facility provides for a secured line of
credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made to the
Fund. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any
such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the
Fund's total assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit
Facility was $160,000,000. Effective May 11, 2011, the total commitment under
the Credit Facility was increased to $170,000,000. For the fiscal year ended May
31, 2011, the average amount outstanding was $153,065,753. The loans under the
Credit Facility funded by CRC Funding, LLC (the "Conduit Lender") bear interest
for each settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper
rate of the Conduit Lender. The loans under the Credit Facility funded by
Citibank, N.A. (the "Secondary Lender") bear interest for each settlement period
at a per annum rate equal to (i) the Eurodollar rate for the settlement period
plus 0.60% or (ii) the alternate base rate plus 0.60%. For the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2011, the Fund had no loans under the Credit Facility funded by the
Secondary Lender. The high and low annual interest rates for the loans under the
Credit Facility funded by the Conduit Lender during the fiscal year ended May
31, 2011, were 0.46% and 0.18%, respectively, with a weighted average interest
rate of 0.31%. The annual interest rate in effect for such loans at May 31, 2011
was 0.27%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs, which includes a
program fee of 0.30% of the amount outstanding and a liquidity fee of 0.30% of
the total commitment under the Credit Facility per year. On May 11, 2011, the
Fund extended the expiration date of the Credit Facility for another year and
paid upfront closing fees of $595,000. Such fees are amortized over a one year
period and are included with the other borrowing costs in "Interest and fees on
loan" on the Statement of Operations.

                             6. RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some of the risks
that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information about the
risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund regulatory
filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the investments owned by the Fund. The value of these investments, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.


                                                                         Page 25

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  MAY 31, 2011


Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Investment prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor determines that it is temporarily
unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that it is impractical to do
so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred and trading in the
investments is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take temporary
defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree.

High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of
loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an
issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for high-yield
securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the value of the Senior Loan, which
will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value of the
Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another lender,
for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject to
credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be secured
by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the Fund's
investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the principal
amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also, to the
extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its subsidiaries or
affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline in value, be
relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of its value,
causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the liquidation
of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the issuer's
obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled interest or
principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

                               7. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there was
the following subsequent event:

On June 20, 2011, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.0700 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on July 6, 2011, payable July 15, 2011.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE
INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II ("the Fund") (formerly known as First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II), including the portfolio
of investments, as of May 31, 2011, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2011 by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, agent banks, and brokers; where replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2011, the results
of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the changes in its
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in then ended, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                            MAY 31, 2011 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation,
            the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

ITEM 4.  PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

      (a)   AUDIT FEES (REGISTRANT) -- The aggregate fees billed for each of the
            last two fiscal years for professional services rendered by the

            2010 and $0 for 2011.

      AUDIT-RELATED FEES (INVESTMENT ADVISER) -- The aggregate fees billed in

      Pursuant to its charter and its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval
Policy, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") is responsible for the
pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services (including
the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for the Registrant by its
independent auditors. The Chairman of the Committee is authorized to give such
pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up to $25,000 and report any such
pre-approval to the full Committee.

      The Committee is also responsible for the pre-approval of the independent
auditor's engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's adviser (not
including a sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is
sub-contracted or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser
that provides ongoing services to the Registrant, if the engagement relates
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant, subject to
the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Rule 2-01 of
Regulation S-X. If the independent auditor has provided non-audit services to
the Registrant's adviser (other than any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is sub-contracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser) and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its policies, the Committee
will consider whether the provision of such non-audit services is compatible
with the auditor's independence.


<PAGE>

     (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
            through (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment
            adviser of this Item that were approved by the audit committee
            pursuant to the pre-approval exceptions included in paragraph
            (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X
            are as follows:

                  (b)  0%

                  (c)  0%

                  (d)  0%

      (f)   The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
            engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the
            most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
            persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent
            employees was less than fifty percent.

      (g)   The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
            for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the
            registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
            role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
            overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
            controlled by, or under common control with the adviser that
            provides ongoing services to the Registrant for 2010 were $5,200 and
            $36,000 for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser,
            respectively, and for 2011 were $15.18 and $0 for the Registrant and
            the Registrant's investment adviser, respectively.

      (h)   The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees determined
            that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
            Registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose
            role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or
            overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling,
            controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser
            that provides ongoing services to the Registrant that were not
            pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of
            Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
            accountant's independence.

ITEM 5.  AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

      (a)   The registrant has a separately designated standing audit committee
            consisting of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The
            members of the audit committee are: Thomas R. Kadlec, Niel B.
            Nielson, Richard E. Erickson and Robert F. Keith.

            the close of the reporting period is included as part of the report
            to shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS



Potential conflicts of interest may arise when a portfolio manager of the
Registrant has day-to-day management responsibilities with respect to one or
more other funds or other accounts. Currently, the Leveraged Finance Investment
Team of First Trust does not manage or oversee any other funds or accounts.
Accordingly, there should not be material conflicts in the allocation of
investment opportunities between the Registrant and other accounts managed by
the Leveraged Finance Investment Team.

First Trust and its affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P. ("FTP"), have in
place a joint Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures that
are designed to (a) prevent First Trust personnel from trading securities based
upon material inside information in the possession of such personnel and (b)
ensure that First Trust personnel avoid actual or potential conflicts of
interest or abuse of their positions of trust and responsibility that could
occur through such activities as front running securities trades for the
Registrant. Personnel are required to have duplicate confirmations and account
statements delivered to First Trust and FTP compliance personnel who then
compare such trades to trading activity to detect any potential conflict
situations. In addition to the personal trading restrictions specified in the
Code of Ethics and Insider Trading Policies and Procedures, employees in the
Leveraged Finance Investment Team are prohibited from buying or selling equity
securities (including derivative instruments such as options, warrants and
futures) and corporate bonds for their personal account and in any accounts over
which they exercise control. Employees in the Leveraged Finance Investment Team
are also prohibited from engaging in any personal transaction while in
possession of material non-public information regarding the security or the
issuer of the security.


<PAGE>

First Trust and FTP also maintain a confidential watch list of all issuers for
which the Leveraged Finance Investment Team has material non-public information
in its possession an all transactions executed for a product advised or
supervised by First Trust or FTP are compared daily against the watch list.

     (a)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM
            MEMBERS INFORMATION PROVIDED AS OF JULY 29, 2011



The  compensation  structure  for the Leveraged Finance Investment Team of First
Trust  is  based upon a fixed salary as well as a discretionary bonus determined
by the management of First Trust.

Salaries  are  determined  by  management  and  are  based  upon an individual's
position  and  overall  value  to  the  firm.  Bonuses  are  also  determined by
management  and  are  based  upon  an  individual's  overall contribution to the
success  of the firm and the profitability of the firm. Salaries and bonuses for
members  of  the  Leveraged  Finance Investment Team are not based upon criteria
such  as  performance  of  the  Registrant  or  the value of assets of the Fund,
although  discretionary  bonuses for Leveraged Finance Team members are based on
the profitability of the leveraged finance department.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.


                                      -2-


<PAGE>


                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.


                                      -3-


<PAGE>


VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.
