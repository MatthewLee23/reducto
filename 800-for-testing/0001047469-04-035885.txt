EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS as of September 30, 2004

LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

[PHOTO OF THOMAS J. FETTER]
Thomas J. Fetter
President

The municipal bond market consists of a broad array of bond issues, with widely
varying features and performance characteristics that may make them appropriate
for a specific investment scenario. In this edition of our continuing
educational series, we will feature zero coupon bonds - a variety of bond that
has seen increasing use by investors over the past 20 years - and discuss why
they can provide flexibility in managing a bond portfolio.

THE 1980'S BROUGHT NEW VARIATIONS TO THE BOND MARKET...

Any discussion of zero coupon bonds should start with the term "coupon."
Traditionally, bonds were issued in certificate form, with interest coupons
attached, which the owner would clip and present for payment. The coupon rate
indicates the rate of annual interest the issuer pays to the bondholder. For
example, a $1,000 bond with a 5% coupon makes two semiannual interest payments
of $25 each.

Today, most bonds are issued as "book-entry bonds," registered in the owner's
name on the books of the issuer, but not delivered in certificate form. That
change has not only replaced the antiquated coupon-clipping system, but also
encouraged the development of new types of bonds - including zero coupon
bonds, introduced in 1982.

ZERO-COUPONS: NO INTEREST PAYMENTS, BUT A PREDICTABLE LUMP-SUM PAYMENT AT
MATURITY...

Zero coupon bonds do not have coupons attached and do not make regular interest
payments. Instead, they are issued at a discount, usually well below par, or
face value. As with coupon bonds, the bondholder receives face value if the bond
is held to its maturity date. Over time - from its issuance to its maturity -
zero coupon bonds accrete to par, meaning that their price appreciates over time
to reflect the accrual of "imputed" compound interest. An investor holding a
zero coupon bond to maturity receives a lump sum payment from the issuer for
face value reflecting the initial investment plus interest that has accrued.
Although zero coupon bonds do not pay any interest until they mature, the
accrual of "imputed" compound interest is recognized currently. Mutual funds are
required to distribute substantially all of their income (including accrued
income) annually. A fund may therefore be required to sell securities to obtain
cash needed for income distributions.

ZERO COUPON BONDS PROVIDE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY...

For a portfolio manager, zero coupons can play a useful strategic role. Like
other bonds, zero coupon bond prices are affected by market conditions, changes
in an issuer's underlying fundamentals and fluctuations in interest rates.
Because they pay no coupon or periodic interest payments, they typically display
more price sensitivity than other bonds in response to changes in interest
rates. Therefore, zero coupon bonds can provide more appreciation potential in a
declining interest rate environment. Of course, zero coupons display increased
DOWNSIDE volatility in the event of an INCREASE in interest rates.

Some zero coupon bonds start out as coupon-bearing bonds, which are then
deposited with a trustee and subsequently "stripped" of their coupons. New
securities are then created from principal and coupon payments. This allows an
investor to choose a maturity to match the time when funds will be needed.
Moreover, because of their many permutations, zero coupon bonds can help balance
income-oriented bonds with performance-oriented zero coupons, providing more
versatility in managing a municipal portfolio.

                                               Sincerely,

                                               /s/ Thomas J. Fetter
                                               Thomas J. Fetter
                                               President

EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS as of September 30, 2004

MARKET RECAP

The U.S. economy continued to expand in the year ended September 30, 2004,
although at a somewhat more moderate rate, as the fiscal year drew to a close.
One key economic factor was the surge in gasoline and energy prices, which
raised fears that inflation could re-emerge. Amid those concerns, bond market
performance was less robust in the second half of the year than in the first
half.

IN AN UNEVEN ECONOMY, SOME SECTORS GENERATED GROWTH...

The nation's Gross Domestic Product grew by 3.7% in the third quarter of 2004,
following a 2.8% rise in the second quarter. Economic activity was uneven, with
some segments slowing, while others grew at varying rates. For example, retail
sales slowed in reaction to consumer concerns over inflation and ongoing
geo-political events. Auto sales were impacted by higher gas prices, with buyers
opting for fuel-efficient smaller vehicles over SUVs and trucks.

Interestingly, manufacturing activity grew stronger, driven by rising demand for
durable goods and capital equipment. Demand for aerospace equipment, steel
products, industrial machinery, and information technology products was
especially strong. Non-durable goods manufacturing, tied more closely to
consumer spending, weakened significantly. The construction sector followed
recent patterns, with residential building on the rise, while commercial
activity lagged.

HOWEVER ERRATIC, JOB GROWTH HAS GAINED SOME STRENGTH...

Meanwhile, job growth continued to puzzle many economists throughout much of the
year. Having made significant productivity improvements during the recent
economic downturn, many businesses were slow to return to previous employment
levels. As a result, job gains during the summer and early fall fell short of
expectations. However, later reports brought news of a surge in new employment,
with strength in construction areas, as well as in the energy, transportation,
health care and service sectors. The nation's unemployment rate fell to 5.4% in
September 2004, down from 6.1% a year earlier.

THE FEDERAL RESERVE REMAINED VIGILANT IN LIGHT OF RISING INFLATION...

Inflation re-emerged as a concern to investors and to the Federal Reserve. Oil
prices soared amid supply concerns, which were exacerbated by the continuing
turmoil in the Middle East, hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico and surging demand
from China. Against that backdrop, the Federal Reserve emphasized that it would
wage a vigorous fight against inflation. After maintaining a stable interest
rate policy for more than a year, the Fed raised its benchmark Federal Funds
rate by 25 basis points in June, August and September 2004.

Following a strong rally in the first half of the year, the municipal bond
market lost some momentum in the second half, as inflation exerted upward
pressure on interest rates. For the year ended September 30, 2004, the Lehman
Brothers Municipal Bond Index had a total return of 4.60%.*

*It is not possible to invest directly in an Index. The Index's total return
does not reflect commissions or expenses that would have been incurred if an
investor individually purchased or sold the securities represented in the Index.

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  The U.S. economy continued to expand modestly in 2004, although consumers
   grew increasingly worried about rising fuel costs. Economic growth was
   supported primarily by capital spending, as businesses made new investments
   in computers and machinery. The U.S. jobless rate was 5.4% in September 2004,
   down from 6.1% a year ago.

- -  Reflecting the key role of transportation in the nation's economy, insured*
   transportation bonds were the Fund's largest sector weighting at September
   30, 2004. As the nation has upgraded its transportation facilities to adjust
   to changing needs, the Fund's investments included issues for turnpikes,
   highways, bridges, monorails and mass transit.

- -  Insured* general obligations (GO) again played a prominent role in the Fund.
   Given the slow economic recovery, insured* GOs were prized investments,
   especially in a market characterized by very narrow quality spreads.

- -  The Fund maintained a focus on essential services bonds, including insured*
   electric utility bonds. The revenues for these issues derive from utility
   payments and are, therefore, considered less subject to economic fluctuations
   than more discretionary expenditures.

- -  At September 30, 2004, the Fund had leverage in the amount of approximately
   38% of the Fund's total assets. The Fund uses leverage through the issuance
   of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for
   increased income, but, at the same time, creates special risks (including the
   likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of
   common shares).

PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND
ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET ASSET VALUE OR SHARE
PRICE (AS APPLICABLE) WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS REINVESTED. INVESTMENT RETURN AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO THAT SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE
OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PERFORMANCE IS FOR THE STATED TIME PERIOD
ONLY; DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY, THE FUND'S CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR
HIGHER THAN THE QUOTED RETURN.

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  Although the California economy managed to halt its job losses in 2004, the
   state continued to lag the nation in new job creation. While the state's
   information technology area was slow to recover, business services, energy
   and construction sectors were strong. The state's September 2004 jobless rate
   was 5.9%, down from 6.7% a year ago.

- -  Insured* general obligations (GOs) constituted the Fund's largest sector
   weighting at September 30, 2004. Given the state's recent budgetary and
   financial difficulties, the Fund's investments focused primarily on insured*
   local school district bonds of communities with a good property tax base and
   sound local finances.

- -  Insured* lease revenue/certificates of participation (COPs) were major
   investments for the Fund. COPs were a vehicle employed by various Financing
   Authorities throughout the state to finance such diverse projects as
   recreational facilities, public improvements and seismic - quake-resistant -
   retrofits.

- -  Insured* special tax revenue bonds were significant investments of the Fund
   and financed a wide variety of projects. The Fund's investments included
   issues that financed school projects, rapid transit projects and public
   facilities throughout California.

- -  At September 30, 2004, the Fund had leverage in the amount of approximately
   39% of the Fund's total assets. The Fund uses leverage through the issuance
   of preferred shares. Use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for
   increased income, but, at the same time, creates special risks (including the
   likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of
   common shares).

MANAGEMENT UPDATE

- -  In 2004, the New York economy registered its strongest growth since the 2001
   recession. The state saw a significant upturn in key sectors, such as
   business services, information, technology and continued growth in health
   care, education and tourism. These areas offset job losses in manufacturing,
   banking and government. The state's September 2004 jobless rate was 5.5%,
   down from 6.4% a year ago.

- -  Insured* transportation bonds were the Fund's largest sector weighting at
   September 30, 2004. The Fund's investments included issues for toll bridges,
   mass transit and port authorities, which have increased their investments to
   meet the New York area's growth and security needs.

- -  Insured* private education bonds were a significant focus of the Fund, with
   an emphasis on dormitory issues. These bonds provides financing for the
   construction and expansion of dormitories, classrooms and lab facilities for
   public and private universities throughout the state.

- -  The Fund insured* hospital bond investments emphasized institutions with
   strong patient demand. In a competitive industry, management targeted some of
   New York's most renowed facilities, including New York Presbyterian and
   Memorial Sloan-Kettering.

- -  At September 30, 2004, the Fund had leverage in the amount of approximately
   38% of the Fund's total assets. The Fund uses leverage through the issuance

The Fund invests primarily in debt securities issued by municipalities. The
ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their obligations may be
affected by economic developments in a specific industry or municipality. In
order to reduce the risk associated with such economic developments, at
September 30, 2004, 83.6% of the securities in the portfolio of investments are
backed by bond insurance of various financial institutions and financial
guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by an individual
financial institution ranged from 4.7% to 25.0% of total investments.

(1) Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
    requirements on open financial futures contracts.

The Fund invests primarily in debt securities issued by California
municipalities. The ability of the issuers of the debt securities to meet their
obligations may be affected by economic developments in a specific industry or
municipality. In order to reduce the risk associated with such economic
developments, at September 30, 2004, 86.0% of the securities in the portfolio of
investments are backed by bond insurance of various financial institutions and
financial guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by an
individual financial institution ranged from 17.4% to 28.8% of total
investments.

(1) Security (or a portion thereof) has been segregated to cover margin
    requirements on open financial futures contracts.

backed by bond insurance of various financial institutions and financial
guaranty assurance agencies. The aggregate percentage insured by an individual
financial institution ranged from 2.2% to 37.9% of total investments.

(1)  Computed using average common shares outstanding.

(2)  For the period from the start of business, August 30, 2002, to September
     30, 2002.

(3)  Net asset value at beginning of period reflects the deduction of the sales
     load of $0.675 per share paid by the shareholder from the $15.000 offering
     price.

(4)  Total investment return on net asset value is calculated assuming a
     purchase at the offering price of $15.000 less the sales load of $0.675 per
     share paid by the shareholder on the first day and a sale at the net asset
     value on the last day of the period reported. Total investment return on
     market value is calculated assuming a purchase at the offering price of
     $15.000 less the sales load of $0.675 per share paid by the shareholder on
     the first day and a sale at the current market price on the last day of the
     period reported. Total investment return on net asset value and total
     investment return on market value are not computed on an annualized basis.

(5)  Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage
     change in net asset value or market value with all distributions
     reinvested. Total return is not computed on an annualized basis.

(6)  Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
     shareholders. Ratios to average net assets applicable to common shares
     reflect the Fund's leveraged capital structure.

(7)  Annualized.

(8)  Calculated by subtracting the Fund's total liabilities (not including the
     preferred shares) from the Fund's total assets, and dividing this by the
     number of preferred shares outstanding.

(9)  Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL FUNDS as of September 30, 2004

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Insured Municipal Bond Fund (Insured Municipal Fund), Eaton Vance
   Insured California Municipal Bond Fund (Insured California Fund), and Eaton
   Vance Insured New York Municipal Bond Fund (Insured New York Fund),
   (individually referred to as the Fund or collectively the Funds) are
   registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), as
   amended, as non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies. The
   Insured Municipal Fund was organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of
   Massachusetts by an Agreement and Declaration of Trust dated July 2, 2002.
   The Insured California Fund and the Insured New York Fund were organized
   under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by an Agreement and
   Declaration of Trust dated July 8, 2002. Each Fund's investment objective is
   to achieve current income exempt from regular federal income tax, including
   alternative minimum tax, and taxes in its specified state. Each Fund seeks to
   achieve its objective by investing primarily in high grade municipal
   obligations that are insured as to the timely payment of principal and
   interest.

   The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
   followed by each Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
   policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
   the United States of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Municipal bonds are normally valued on the basis of
   valuations furnished by a pricing service. Taxable obligations, if any, for
   which price quotations are readily available are normally valued at the mean
   between the bid and asked prices. Futures contracts and options on futures
   contracts listed on the commodity exchanges are valued at closing settlement
   prices. Over-the-counter options on futures contracts are normally valued at
   the mean between the latest bid and asked prices. Interest rate swaps are
   normally valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a broker. Short-term
   obligations, maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost,
   which approximates value. Investments for which valuations or market
   quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value using methods
   determined in good faith by or at the direction of the Trustees.

   B INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction date. The securities so purchased are subject to market
   fluctuations during this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed
   delivery purchases are outstanding, the Fund instructs the custodian to
   segregate assets in a separate account, with a current value at least equal
   to the amount of its purchase commitments.

   C INCOME -- Interest income is determined on the basis of interest accrued,
   adjusted for amortization of premium or discount.

   D FEDERAL TAXES -- Each Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable, if any, and
   tax-exempt income, including any net realized gain on investments. Therefore,
   no provision for federal income or excise tax is necessary. At September 30,
   2004, the Funds, for federal income tax purposes, had a capital loss
   carryover which will reduce taxable income arising from future net realized
   gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue
   Code and thus will reduce the amount of distributions to shareholders which
   would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Funds of any liability for
   federal income or excise tax. The amounts and expiration dates of the capital
   loss carryovers are as follows:

<Table>
<Caption>
   FUND                          AMOUNT         EXPIRES
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   <S>                        <C>               <C>
   Insured Municipal Fund     $   1,072,880     September 30, 2011

   Insured California Fund          557,635     September 30, 2011

   Insured New York Fund          1,251,495     September 30, 2011
                                  1,166,633     September 30, 2012
</Table>

   Additionally, at September 30, 2004, Insured Municipal Fund, Insured
   California Fund and Insured New York Fund had net capital losses of
   $10,957,039, $10,115,483 and $5,122,077, respectively, attributable to
   security transactions incurred after October 31, 2003. These are treated as
   arising on the first day of each Fund's taxable year ending September 30,
   2005.

   In addition, each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable it to
   designate distributions from the interest income generated by its investments
   in municipal obligations, which are exempt from regular federal income taxes
   when received by each Fund, as exempt-interest dividends.

                                       26

   E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Funds in connection with the
   offerings of the common shares and preferred shares were recorded as a
   reduction of capital paid in excess of par applicable to common shares.

   F FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the entering of a financial futures
   contract, a Fund is required to deposit (initial margin) either in cash or
   securities an amount equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by a Fund (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying security, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by a Fund. A Fund's investment in
   financial futures contracts is designed for both hedging against anticipated
   future changes in interest rates and investment purposes. Should interest
   rates move unexpectedly, a Fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits of
   the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

   G OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon the purchase of a put option on a
   financial futures contract by a Fund, the premium paid is recorded as an
   investment, the value of which is marked-to-market daily. When a purchased
   option expires, a Fund will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the
   option. When a Fund enters into a closing sale transaction, a Fund will
   realize a gain or loss depending on whether the sales proceeds from the
   closing sale transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option.
   When a Fund exercises a put option, settlement is made in cash. The risk
   associated with purchasing put options is limited to the premium originally
   paid.

   H USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   I INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under each Fund's organizational documents, its
   officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and
   expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to each Fund and
   shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for the obligations
   of each Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, each Fund
   enters into agreements with service providers that may contain
   indemnification clauses. Each Fund's maximum exposure under these
   arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
   against each Fund that have not yet occurred.

   J EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Funds. Pursuant to the respective custodian agreements, IBT
   receives a fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average
   daily cash balances each Fund maintains with IBT. All credit balances used to
   reduce the Funds' custodian fees are reported as a reduction of total
   expenses in the Statement of Operations.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   Each Fund issued Auction Preferred Shares on October 29, 2002 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discounts and other offering costs were recorded
   as a reduction of the capital of the common shares of each Fund. Dividends on
   the APS, which accrue daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established
   at the offering of each Fund's APS and generally have been reset every seven
   days thereafter by an auction, unless a special dividend period has been set.
   Special dividend periods are currently in effect on the following series:

   The APS are redeemable at the option of each Fund at a redemption price equal
   to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any dividend
   payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if any Fund is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board
   of Trustees. In general, the holders of the APS and the Common Shares have
   equal voting rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the
   APS, as a separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the
   Board of Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per
   share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. Each Fund is required to
   maintain certain asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in each
   Fund's By-Laws and the Investment Company Act of 1940. Each Fund pays an
   annual fee equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares liquidation value for
   the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred auction.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

   Each Fund intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payments of any dividends on any outstanding APS. Distributions are
   recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions of realized capital gains, if
   any, are made at least annually. Distributions to preferred shareholders are
   recorded daily and are payable at the end of each dividend period. Each
   dividend payment period for the APS is generally seven days. Insured
   Municipal Fund Series B shares set a special dividend period of 364 days
   effective March 3, 2004. Insured Municipal Fund Series C shares set a special
   dividend period of 728 days effective August 6, 2003. Insured Municipal Fund
   Series B and Series C will pay each Series' accumulated dividends on the
   first business day of each month. The applicable dividend rate for APS on
   September 30, 2004 are listed below. For the year ended September 30, 2004,
   the amount of dividends each Fund paid to Auction Preferred shareholders and
   average APS dividend rates for such period were as follows:

   The Funds distinguish between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the difference in method for accreting market discount and
   amortizing premiums.

   The tax character of distributions paid for the years ended September 30,

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.65% of each
   Fund's average weekly gross assets, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM) as compensation for investment advisory services rendered to each Fund.
   Except for Trustees of each Fund who are not members of EVM's organization,
   officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services to each Fund
   out of such investment adviser fee. For the year ended September 30, 2004,
   the fee was equivalent to 0.65% of each Fund's average weekly gross assets
   and amounted to $9,992,611, $3,275,789, and $2,388,716 for Insured Municipal
   Fund, Insured California Fund and Insured New York Fund, respectively. EVM
   also serves as the administrator of the Funds, but currently receives no
   compensation.

   In addition, EVM has contractually agreed to reimburse the Fund for fees and
   other expenses in the amount of 0.32% of average weekly gross assets of each
   Fund during the first five full years of each Fund's operations, 0.24% of
   average weekly gross assets of each Fund in year six, 0.16% in year seven and
   0.08% in year eight. For the year ended September 30, 2004, EVM contractually
   waived $4,919,439, $1,612,696 and $1,175,983 of its advisory fee for Insured
   Municipal Fund, Insured California Fund and Insured New York Fund,
   respectively

   Certain officers and one Trustee of each Fund are officers of the above

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   Each Fund may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in
   the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure
   to various market risks. These financial instruments include futures
   contracts and may involve, to a varying degree, elements of risk in excess of
   the amounts recognized for financial statement purposes. The notional or
   contractual amounts of these instruments represent the investment each Fund
   has in particular classes of financial instruments and does not necessarily
   represent the amounts potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the
   risks associated with these instruments is meaningful only when all related
   and offsetting transactions are considered.

   A summary of obligations under these financial instruments at September 30,
   2004 is as follows:

9  OVERDRAFT ADVANCES

   Pursuant to the custodian agreement between the Funds and Investors Bank &

   current rate of interest charged by the

   Bank for secured loans (currently, a rate above the federal funds rate). This
   obligation is payable on demand to the Bank. At September 30, 2004, the

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Eaton Vance Insured Municipal Bond Fund, Eaton
Vance Insured California Municipal Bond Fund, and Eaton Vance Insured New York
Municipal Bond Fund ("the Funds") as of September 30, 2004, and the related
statements of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for the years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the financial
highlights for the years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the period from
the start of business, August 30, 2002 to September 30, 2002. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds'
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities held as of September 30, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers; where replies were not received
from brokers, we performed other auditing procedures. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights, referred to
above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton
Vance Insured Municipal Bond Fund, Eaton Vance Insured California Municipal Bond
Fund, and Eaton Vance Insured New York Municipal Bond Fund at September 30,
2004, the results of their operations for the year then ended, the changes in
their net assets for the years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003, and their
financial highlights for the years ended September 30, 2004 and 2003 and the
period from the start of business, August 30, 2002 to September 30, 2002, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

EATON VANCE INSURED MUNICIPAL BOND FUNDS

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Each Fund offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
automatically reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the same Fund. You may
elect to participate in the Plan by completing the Dividend Reinvestment Plan
Application Form. If you do not participate, you will receive all distributions
in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc. as dividend paying
agent. On the distribution payment date, if the net asset value per Share is
equal to or less than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, then new Shares will be issued. The number of Shares shall be
determined by the greater of the net asset value per Share or 95% of the market
price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased on the open market by the
Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if any) are taxable whether or
not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with each Fund's transfer agent, PFPC Inc., or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by each
Fund. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

Any inquiries regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc.,
at 1-800-331-1710.

</Table>

(1)  Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and
     related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the
     audit of financial statements and are not reported under the category of
     audit fees and specifically include fees for the performance of certain
     agreed-upon procedures relating to the registrant's auction preferred
     shares.

<Page>

(2)  Tax fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for professional services
     rendered by the principal accountant relating to tax compliance, tax
     advice, and tax planning.
(3)  All other fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for products and
     services provided by the principal accountant other than audit,
     audit-related, and tax services.

(e)(1) The registrant's audit committee has adopted policies and procedures
relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrant's principal
accountant (the "Pre-Approval Policies"). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a
framework intended to assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its
pre-approval responsibilities. As a general matter, the Pre-Approval Policies
(i) specify certain types of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services
determined to be pre-approved by the audit committee; and (ii) delineate
specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process,
including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.
Unless a service is specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies,
it must be separately pre-approved by the audit committee.

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services
pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by the registrant's audit
committee at least annually. The registrant's audit committee maintains full
responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of

(1) Eaton Vance Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp., acts as the
registrant's investment adviser and administrator.

(h) The registrant's audit committee has considered whether the provision by the
registrant's principal accountant of non-audit services to the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2) on the
Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.

Not Applicable.

ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Effective February 9, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees
formalized the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees
to the registrant's Board of Trustees. The Governance Committee shall, when
identifying candidates for the position of Independent Trustee, consider any
such candidate recommended by a shareholder of a Fund if such recommendation
contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the
Secretary of the Fund.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a) It is the conclusion of the registrant's principal executive officer and
principal financial officer that the effectiveness of the registrant's current

registrant has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
period specified in the Commission's rules and forms and that the information
required to be disclosed by the registrant has been accumulated and communicated
to the registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
in order to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There have been no changes in the registrant's internal controls over
financial reporting during the period that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting.

(1) Eaton Vance Management, a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp., acts as the

investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The Board of Trustees of the Trust has adopted a proxy voting policy and
procedure (the "Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated
proxy voting responsibility to the Fund's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which
are described below. The Trustees will review the Fund's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any of
their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund, the investment adviser will
generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving rise
to such conflict until it consults with the Board of the Fund except as
contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Board's Special Committee will instruct
the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the Fund's shareholders and the investment adviser,
the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the Fund by
maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective corporate clients.
The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing and voting proxies
on behalf of the Fund will report any proxy received or expected to be received
from a company included on that list to the investment adviser's general counsel
or chief equity investment officer. The general counsel or chief equity
investment officer will determine if a conflict exists. If a conflict does
exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance with the Policy or
the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the Fund voted proxies relating to
portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004 is available
(1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122, and (2) on the
Securities and Exchange Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov.
