ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.  ORGANIZATION

        Advantage Advisers Xanthus Fund, L.L.C. (the OCompanyO) was organized as
        a limited  liability company under the laws of Delaware in January 1999.
        The Company is registered  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as
        amended,  (the  OActO)  as  a  closed-end,   non-diversified  management
        investment  company.  The Company's term is perpetual unless the Company
        is otherwise terminated under the terms of the Limited Liability Company
        Agreement dated as of June 5, 2003. The Company's  investment  objective
        is to achieve maximum capital appreciation. It pursues this objective by
        actively  investing  in  a  portfolio  consisting  primarily  of  equity
        securities of technology companies and of companies which derive a major
        portion of their  revenue  directly  or  indirectly  from  technological
        events and  advances.  The  Company's  portfolio  of  securities  in the
        technology  area  is  expected  to  include  long  and  short  positions
        primarily in equity  securities of U.S. and non-U.S.  companies.  Equity
        securities  include  common  and  preferred  stock and other  securities
        having equity  characteristics,  including  convertible debt securities,
        stock options, warrants and rights.

        Responsibility  for  the  overall  management  and  supervision  of  the
        operations of the Company is vested in the  individuals who serve as the
        Board of Managers of the Company  (OBoard of  ManagersO).  There are six
        members  of  the  Board  of  Managers,  one of  whom  is  considered  an
        Ointerested  personO under the Act. On March 1, 2006,  the Company named
        James E. Buck as lead Independent Manager of the Board of Managers.  The
        Company's investment adviser is Advantage Advisers Management, L.L.C., a
        Delaware limited  liability  company (the  OAdviserO).  The Adviser is a
        subsidiary of Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc. (OOAMO) and an affiliate
        of  Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.  (OOppenheimerO).  The Adviser is responsible
        for  managing  the  Company's  investment   activities  pursuant  to  an
        investment  advisory  agreement  dated June 5, 2003. OAM is the managing
        member of the Adviser,  and Alkeon Capital Management L.L.C.  (OAlkeonO)
        is a  non-managing  member  of  the  Adviser.  Investment  professionals
        employed by Alkeon,  including  Mr. Takis  Sparaggis,  who serves as the
        Company's portfolio manager, manage the Company's portfolio on behalf of
        the Adviser under the  supervision  of OAM.  Oppenheimer  has a minority
        profit participation interest in Alkeon.

        The acceptance of initial and additional  contributions  from Members is
        subject to approval by the Board of  Managers.  From  January 1, 2004 to
        December  31,  2004,  new Members  were not  accepted  into the Company,
        although  existing  Members as of December 31, 2003 were allowed to make
        additional  contributions.  At a meeting  held on November 1, 2004,  the
        Board of Managers  approved the acceptance of initial  contributions  by
        the Company  from new members on or after  January 1, 2005.  The Company
        may from time to time offer to repurchase  interests pursuant to written
        tenders by Members.  Such  repurchases will be made at such times and on
        such  terms as may be  determined  by the  Board of  Managers,  in their
        complete and exclusive discretion. The Adviser expects that generally it
        will  recommend  to the  Board of  Managers  that the  Company  offer to
        repurchase  interests from Members twice each year, effective at the end
        of the second fiscal quarter and again at the end of the year.

        Generally,  except as provided under  applicable law, a Member shall not
        be liable for the Company's  debts,  obligations  and liabilities in any
        amount in excess of the capital  account  balance of such  Member,  plus
        such Member's share of undistributed profits and assets.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - JUNE 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        The  preparation  of  financial   statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
        generally accepted  accounting  principles  requires the Adviser to make
        estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported  in the
        financial  statements and accompanying  notes. The Adviser believes that
        the estimates utilized in preparing the Company's  financial  statements
        are  reasonable and prudent;  however,  actual results could differ from
        these estimates.

        a.  REVENUE RECOGNITION

        Securities  transactions,  including  related revenue and expenses,  are
        recorded  on a  trade-date  basis,  and  dividends  are  recorded on the
        ex-dividend date, net of applicable  withholding taxes.  Interest income
        and expense are recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on
        fixed income securities are amortized using the effective  interest rate
        method.

        b.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

        The Company's  securities are valued in accordance with policies adopted
        by the Board of Managers, which are summarized below.

        (i) Domestic  exchange traded  securities  (other than options and those
            securities traded on NASDAQ) shall be valued:

            (1) at their last composite sale prices as reported on the exchanges
                where those securities are traded; or

            (2) If no sales of those  securities  are  reported on a  particular
                day, the  securities  are valued based upon their  composite bid
                prices for securities held long, or their composite asked prices
                for securities  sold,  not yet  purchased,  as reported by those
                exchanges.

        (ii) Securities traded on NASDAQ shall be valued:

            (1) at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price (ONOCPO) (which is the last
                trade price at or before 4:00 PM (Eastern  Time)  adjusted up to
                NASDAQ's best offer price if the last traded price is below such
                bid and down to  NASDAQ's  best offer price if the last trade is
                above such offer price); or

            (2) if no NOCP is  available,  at the last sale  price on the NASDAQ
                prior to the  calculation of the net asset value of the Company;
                or

        b.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

            (3) if no sale is shown on NASDAQ, at the bid price; or

            (4) if no sale is shown  and no bid  price is  available,  the price
                will be deemed  OstaleO  and the  value  will be  determined  in
                accordance with the fair valuation procedures set forth herein.

        Securities  traded on a foreign  securities  exchange  will be valued at
        their  last sale  prices  on the  exchange  where  such  securities  are
        primarily  traded,  or in the absence of a reported sale on a particular
        day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities  held long) or asked
        prices (in the case of securities  sold,  not yet purchased) as reported
        by such exchange.  Listed options will be valued at their bid prices (or
        asked prices in the case of listed  written  options) as reported by the
        exchange  with the highest  volume on the last day a trade was reported.
        Other securities for which market  quotations are readily available will
        be valued at their bid prices (or asked prices in the case of securities
        sold,  not yet  purchased) as obtained  from one or more dealers  making
        markets  for those  securities.  If market  quotations  are not  readily
        available,  securities  and other assets will be valued at fair value as
        determined in good faith by, or under the  supervision  of, the Board of
        Managers.

        Debt  securities  will be  valued  in  accordance  with  the  procedures
        described  above,  which with respect to such securities may include the
        use of valuations  furnished by a pricing service which employs a matrix
        to determine  valuation for normal  institutional  size trading units or
        consultation  with brokers and dealers in such securities.  The Board of
        Managers  will  periodically  monitor the  reasonableness  of valuations
        provided by any such pricing  service.  Debt  securities  with remaining
        maturities of 60 days or less will,  absent  unusual  circumstances,  be
        valued at amortized cost, so long as such valuation is determined by the
        Board of Managers to represent fair value.

        All assets and  liabilities  initially  expressed in foreign  currencies
        will be  converted  into  U.S.  dollars  using  foreign  exchange  rates
        provided  by a pricing  service  compiled as of 4:00 p.m.  London  time.
        Trading in foreign securities generally is completed,  and the values of
        such securities are determined, prior to the close of securities markets
        in the U.S.  Foreign  exchange rates are also  determined  prior to such
        close. On occasion, the values of such securities and exchange rates may
        be affected by events occurring between the time such values or exchange
        rates  are  determined  and the  time  that the net  asset  value of the
        Company is determined.  When such events materially affect the values of
        securities held by the Company or its  liabilities,  such securities and
        liabilities will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by,
        or under the supervision of, the Board of Managers.

    2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

        b.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

        Fair value shall take into account the relevant  factors and surrounding
        circumstances, which may include: (i) the nature and pricing history (if
        any) of the  security  or other  investment;  (ii)  whether  any  dealer
        quotations are available;  (iii) possible  valuation  methodologies that
        could be used to determine fair value;  (iv) the  recommendation  of the
        Adviser with respect to the  valuation;  (v) whether the same or similar
        securities  or other  investments  are held by other  accounts  or other
        funds  managed  by the  Adviser  and the  valuation  method  used by the
        Adviser with respect thereto; (vi) the extent to which the fair value to
        be determined  will result from the use of data or formulae  produced by
        third  parties  independent  of the Adviser;  and (vii) the liquidity or
        illiquidity of the market for the security or other investment.

        The fair value of the Company's assets and liabilities  which qualify as
        financial  instruments under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
        No.  107,  ODiscloses  about  Fair  Value  of  Financial   Instruments,O
        approximates the carrying amounts  presented in the Statement  ofAssets,
        Liabilities and Members' Capital.

        c.  CASH EQUIVALENTS

        The Company treats all highly liquid  financial  instruments that mature
        within three months at the time of purchase as cash equivalents.

        d.  INCOME TAXES

        No provision for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes on
        the  profits of the  Company  is made as the  Members  are  individually
        liable for the income taxes on their share of the Company's income.

        The  Company  has   reclassified   ($3,399,281)   and  $47,304,902  from
        accumulated  net investment  loss and  accumulated  net realized gain on
        investments,  respectively, to net capital contributions during the year
        ended December 31, 2005. This reclassification was a result of permanent
        book to tax  differences  to reflect,  as an  adjustment  to net capital
        contributions,  the  amounts of taxable  loss and net  realized  gain on
        investments that have been allocated to the Company's Members and had no
        effect on net assets.

    3.  ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

        Oppenheimer  provides  certain  administrative  services  to the Company
        including,  among other things, providing office space and other support
        services. In exchange for such services,  the Company pays Oppenheimer a
        monthly  administration  fee of 0.08333% (1% on an annualized  basis) of
        the Company's net assets determined as of the beginning of the month.

    3.  ADMINISTRATION FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

        During the six months ended June 30, 2006, Oppenheimer earned $74,912 as
        brokerage commissions from portfolio  transactions executed on behalf of
        the  Company.  Mainsail  Group,  L.L.C.,  a  broker-dealer  affiliate of
        Alkeon,   earned  $304,877  as  brokerage   commissions  from  portfolio
        transactions executed on behalf of the Company.

        Net  profits or net losses of the  Company  for each  fiscal  period are
        allocated among and credited to or debited against the capital  accounts
        of all Members (but not the Special  Advisory Member) as of the last day
        of each fiscal period in accordance with Members' respective  investment
        percentages for the fiscal period.  The Adviser,  in its capacity as the
        Special  Advisory  Member of the  Company,  is  entitled  to  receive an
        incentive  allocation  (the  OIncentive  AllocationO),  charged  to  the
        capital  account  of each  Member as of the last day of each  allocation
        period,  of 20% of the amount by which net profits,  if any,  exceed the
        positive balance in the Member's Oloss recovery  account.O The Incentive
        Allocation is credited to the Special  Advisory  Account of the Adviser.
        By the last  business  day of the month  following  the date on which an
        Incentive Allocation is made, the Adviser may withdraw up to 100% of the
        Incentive  Allocation that was credited to the Special  Advisory Account
        with respect to the allocation period.  During the six months ended June
        30,  2006,  an  Incentive  Allocation  of $149,383  was  credited to the
        Special Advisory  Member's  capital account.  Based upon the profits for
        the six months ended June 30, 2006, the incentive  allocation that would
        have been  credited  to the  Special  Advisory  Account  is  $3,440,362.
        However,  this amount is not reflected in the accompanying  statement of
        changes in members' capital because the incentive allocation is credited
        at the end of the calendar year.

        Each member of the Board of Managers  (each a  OManagerO)  who is not an
        Ointerested  personO of the Company,  as defined by the Act, receives an
        annual  retainer of $5,000  plus a fee for each  meeting  attended.  Any
        Manager  who is an  Ointerested  personO  does not receive any annual or
        other fee from the Company.  Managers who are not  Ointerested  personsO
        are reimbursed by the Company for all reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses
        incurred by them in performing their duties.

        PFPC  Trust  Company  (the  OCustodianO)  serves  as  custodian  of  the
        Company's assets.

        PFPC Inc.  (OPFPCO) serves as investor  services and accounting agent to
        the  Company  and  in  that  capacity   provides   certain   accounting,
        recordkeeping  and investor related  services.  The Company pays PFPC an
        accounting and investor  services fee based primarily on the average net
        assets of the Company as of the last day of each month, payable monthly,
        subject to a minimum annual fee.

        Oppenheimer acts as the  non-exclusive  placement agent for the Company,
        without  special   compensation  from  the  Company,   and  bears  costs
        associated  with  its  activities  as  placement  agent.   However,  the
        placement agent is entitled to charge a sales commission of up to 3% (up
        to 3.1%  of the  amount  invested)  in  connection  with a  purchase  of
        interests,  at its  discretion.  For the six months ended June 30, 2006,
        such sales commissions earned by Oppenheimer amounted to $73,180.

    4.  INDEMNIFICATIONS

        The Company has entered into  several  contracts  that  contain  routine
        indemnification  clauses.  The Company's  maximum  exposure  under these
        arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be
        made against the Company that have not yet occurred.  However,  based on
        experience, the Company expects the risk of loss to be remote.

    5.  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

        Aggregate  purchases  and  sales  of  investment  securities,  excluding
        short-term securities,  for the six months ended June 30, 2006, amounted
        to $1,166,670,542 and $1,126,467,870,  respectively. Aggregate purchases
        and sales of securities  sold, not yet purchased,  excluding  short-term
        securities,  for the  six  months  ended  June  30,  2006,  amounted  to
        $701,026,062 and $791,839,518, respectively.

        At December 31, 2005, the aggregate cost for Federal income tax purposes
        of portfolio  investments  and  securities  sold,  not yet purchased was
        $375,525,790, and $106,579,426, respectively.

        For Federal income tax purposes,  at December 31, 2005,  accumulated net
        unrealized  depreciation on portfolio  investments and securities  sold,
        not yet  purchased  was  $2,928,116,  consisting  of  $16,343,541  gross
        unrealized appreciation and $19,271,657 gross unrealized depreciation.

        Due from broker primarily  represents proceeds from securities sold, not
        yet purchased,  net of excess cash,  held at the prime broker as of June
        30, 2006.

    6.  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

        The Company has the ability to trade on margin and, in that  connection,
        borrow funds from brokers and banks for investment purposes.  Trading in
        equity  securities  on  margin  involves  an  initial  cash  requirement
        representing  at  least  50% of the  underlying  security's  value  with
        respect to transactions  in U.S.  markets and varying  percentages  with
        respect to transactions in foreign markets. The Act requires the Company
        to satisfy an asset coverage  requirement  of 300% of its  indebtedness,
        including amounts borrowed,  measured at the time the Company incurs the
        indebtedness. The Company pays interest on outstanding margin borrowings
        at an  annualized  rate  of  LIBOR  plus  0.875%.  The  Company  pledges
        securities as collateral for the margin borrowings, which are maintained
        in a  segregated  account held by the  Custodian.  As of and for the six
        months  ended June 30,  2006,  the  Company  had no  outstanding  margin
        borrowings.

    7.  FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE  SHEET RISK OR CONCENTRATIONS OF
        CREDIT RISK

        In the  normal  course  of  business,  the  Company  may  trade  various
        financial  instruments and enter into various investment activities with
        off-balance sheet risk. These financial  instruments include options and
        securities   sold,  not  yet  purchased.   Generally,   these  financial
        instruments  represent  future  commitments  to  purchase  or sell other
        financial  instruments at specific terms at specified future dates. Each
        of these financial  instruments  contains varying degrees of off-balance
        sheet  risk  whereby  changes  in the  market  value  of the  securities
        underlying  the  financial  instruments  may be in excess of the amounts
        recognized in the statement of assets, liabilities and members' capital.

        The Company maintains cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may
        exceed  federally  insured  limits.  The Company has not experienced any
        losses  in such  accounts  and does not  believe  it is  exposed  to any
        significant credit risk on such bank deposits.

        Securities sold, not yet purchased represent  obligations of the Company
        to deliver  specified  securities  and thereby  creates a  liability  to
        purchase  such   securities   in  the  market  at   prevailing   prices.
        Accordingly,  these transactions result in off-balance sheet risk as the
        Company's  ultimate  obligation to satisfy the sale of securities  sold,
        not yet  purchased  may exceed the amount  indicated in the statement of
        assets, liabilities and members' capital.

        The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the Company pays a
        premium  whether  or not the  option  is  exercised.  Additionally,  the
        Company  bears the risk of loss of premium  and  change in market  value
        should the  counterparty  not perform under the  contract.  Put and call
        options  purchased  are  accounted  for in the same manner as investment
        securities.

        When the Company writes an option,  the premium  received by the Company
        is recorded as a liability and is  subsequently  adjusted to the current
        market value of the option written.  If a call option is exercised,  the
        premium  is  added  to the  proceeds  from  the  sale of the  underlying
        security in determining whether the Company has realized a gain or loss.
        In  writing  an  option,  the  Company  bears  the  market  risk  of  an
        unfavorable  change in the price of the security or index underlying the
        written  option.  Exercise  of an option  written by the  Company  could
        result in the Company  selling or buying a security at a price different
        from the current market value.  During for the six months ended June 30,
        2006, transactions in written options were as follows:

    8.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

        On July 13,  2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)
        released FASB  Interpretation  No. 48  OAccounting  for  Uncertainty  in
        Income  TaxesO (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides  guidance for how uncertain tax
        positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the
        financial  statements.  FIN 48 requires the  evaluation of tax positions
        taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing  the  Company's
        tax   returns   to   determine    whether   the   tax    positions   are
        Omore-likely-than-notO   of  being   sustained  by  the  applicable  tax
        authority.  Tax  positions  not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not
        threshold  would be  recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current
        year.  Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal years  beginning  after
        December  15,  2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the
        effective date. At this time,  management is evaluating the implications
        of FIN 48 and its impact in the  financial  statements  has not yet been
        determined.

III.   APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

At a meeting  held on March 1, 2006,  the Board of Managers of the Company  (the
OBoardO) completed its annual consideration of, and approved the renewal of, the
Company's  investment advisory agreement with the Adviser. A special meeting was
held on January 10, 2006 at which  management  provided  and  reviewed  with the
Board charts comparing the fees and expense  structure of the Company with those
of comparable  registered funds and comparing the investment  performance of the
Company to the  performance of similar funds and industry  indices and discussed
with the Board the materials to be provided at the March 1, 2006 meeting.

In  approving  the  renewal of the  investment  advisory  agreement,  the Board,
including each of the Independent  Managers,  reviewed various written materials
provided  by the  Adviser  at the  request  of the Board and  assessed:  (i) the
nature,  extent and quality of the services  provided to the  Company;  (ii) the
investment  performance of the Company relative to other comparable funds; (iii)
advisory  fees and other fees and  expenses  of the Company  (including  fee and
expense  information for comparable  funds) and the profitability of the Adviser
and its affiliates with respect to its relationship  with the Company;  (iv) the
extent to which  economies  of scale would be realized as the  Company's  assets
under management increase;  and (v) whether advisory fee levels reflect any such
economies  of scale for the benefit of  investors.  The Board also  approved the
renewal  of the  administrative  services  agreement  between  the  Company  and
Oppenheimer,  an affiliate of the Adviser, which provides certain administrative
services to the Company.

In  considering  the nature,  extent and  quality of  services  that the Adviser
provides  to the  Company,  the Board  reviewed  presentations  from  management
relating to staffing, management and the organizational structure of the various
departments  of  Oppenheimer  providing  services  to  the  Company.  Management
reviewed the

investment management,  compliance, regulatory risk management,  administration,
accounting  infrastructure and investor related services provided by the Adviser
and Oppenheimer and reviewed the costs associated with providing these services.
The  Independent  Managers  had,  over the previous  twelve  months,  considered
various  matters  relevant to the  consideration  of the renewals of the various
agreements,  including:  the nature, extent and quality of the services provided
to the Company; Oppenheimer's commitment to the advisory business, including the
alternative  investment  advisory  business,  and its  platform  of  proprietary
products;  the research and portfolio  management  capabilities of the personnel
responsible  for managing  the  Company's  assets;  the  appropriateness  of the
Adviser's staffing levels and the commitment of resources to fund accounting and
administration,  shareholder services and regulatory  compliance;  the Adviser's
oversight of third-party service providers; and the profitability of the Adviser
attributable  to providing  services to the Company,  among other  matters.  The
Independent  Managers had previously had discussions  with senior  management at
Oppenheimer  and OAM,  and  with an  independent  board  member  of  Oppenheimer
Holdings Inc. (the ultimate  parent of Oppenheimer  and OAM),  regarding each of
the various  regulatory actions and settlements  involving  Oppenheimer that had
been disclosed to the Board during the past year, including but not limited to a
special  telephonic  meeting  of the  Board  on  November  30,  2005  to  obtain
information from the general counsel of Oppenheimer regarding these matters.

Based on its review,  the Board  concluded  that the Company  benefits  from the
services provided by the Adviser,  including  research and portfolio  management
services and also  benefits  from the  administrative  services  and  compliance
infrastructure  provided  by the Adviser  and  Oppenheimer.  The Board noted its
overall satisfaction with the nature, extent and quality of services provided by
the Adviser and concluded  that the Company was receiving the services  required
from the Adviser under its agreement  with the Company,  and that these services
were of appropriate quality.

In connection with its consideration of the investment advisory  agreement,  the
Board reviewed materials relating to the Company's  investment  performance on a
quarterly basis. The Board also considered the Company's  historical  investment
performance,  including a comparison of such  performance to the  performance of
similar  funds and relevant  indices.  Although the  performance  of the Company
varied from quarter to quarter,  and the Company did not always  outperform such
funds  and  indices,  the  consensus  of the  Board  was  that,  since  the 2003
acquisition of the CIBC asset  management  business by Oppenheimer  and over the
long term, the performance of the Company has been adequate,  although volatile.
The Board also noted that the investment performance of the Company had improved
during the prior year. The Board concluded that management is making appropriate
efforts toward the goal of improving the Company's investment  performance.  The
Independent Managers concluded that the fees paid to Oppenheimer and the Adviser
were reasonable and  appropriate  and were within  industry norms,  based on the
comparisons to similar funds.  In particular,  a fee comparison  showed that the
fees  charged  -- a 1.0%  management  fee and  20%  incentive  allocation  -- is
comparable for similar  products.  The indirect benefits received by the Adviser
and its affiliates  attributable to its  relationships  to the Company also were
considered.

The Board also  considered the advisory fees and current and historical  expense
ratios of the Company for the services  provided by the Adviser and  Oppenheimer
under the investment  advisory agreement and administrative  services agreement,
respectively. In this regard, the Board reviewed a comparison of the Company's

                                      -25-

ADVANTAGE ADVISERS XANTHUS FUND, L.L.C.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


fees and expenses to those of comparable  registered  funds,  and concluded that
the  Company's  fees and expenses  are similar to those of the other funds.  The
Board also considered  revenues received by the Adviser and Oppenheimer from the
Company, including fees and incentive allocations, as well as data regarding the
Adviser's financial condition, compensation and profitability, including related
direct and indirect operating expenses relating to the Company and payments made
to  registered  representatives  of  Oppenheimer  for  services  they provide to
investors.  The Board reviewed the methodology  used to estimate these costs, as
set  forth  in the  profitability  materials  provided  by  management.  It also
considered  the  indirect  benefits  received by the Adviser and its  affiliates
attributable  to  their  relationships  to the  Company.  The  Board  noted  the
Adviser's  continued   willingness  to  manage  the  Company  and  Oppenheimer's
willingness to support the Adviser's  operations  evidenced their  commitment to
providing quality services to the Company.

The  Board  also  recognized  that  the  Adviser  and  Oppenheimer  support  the
distribution  of interests in the Company by making  direct  payments from their
own  resources  to  financial   advisors  of  Oppenheimer  in  connection   with
investor-related services.

Based on its review of  information  relating to the Company's fees and expenses
and the  profitability  of the Adviser and its  affiliates,  the Board concluded
that  the  Company's   fees  under  the   investment   advisory   agreement  and
administrative services agreement bear a reasonable relationship to the services
provided  by the Adviser  and  Oppenheimer,  and  concluded  that the  Company's
advisory fees and expenses were within industry norms.

With respect to whether the Company  benefits  from  economies of scale in costs
associated with services  provided to the Company,  the Board concluded that, as
economies of scale are predicated on increasing  levels of assets,  economies of
scale are not being  realized at the present  time  because  there have been net
outflows of capital from the Company.

Based on the  considerations  described  above,  the following  conclusions  and
determinations  were  made  by the  Board,  including  all  of  the  Independent
Managers:

 1. the nature,  extent and quality of the services  provided by the Adviser are
adequate and appropriate;

 2.  the fees to be paid to the  Adviser  and  Oppenheimer  are  reasonable  and
appropriate in light of  comparative  expense and advisory fee  information  and
benefits  to  be  derived  by  the  Adviser  and  its   affiliates   from  their
relationships with the Company;

 3. the Adviser's  fees are  reasonable in light of the advisory fees charged by
the  Adviser  and other  investment  advisers  to  similar  investment  vehicles
receiving similar services.

 4. in light of a declining level of Company assets over the past several years,
economies  of scale are not being  realized  by the  Adviser or  Oppenheimer  at
current asset levels; and

 5. the approval of the renewal of the Company's  investment  advisory agreement
and administrative  services agreement for an additional annual period is in the
best interests of the Company and its members.
