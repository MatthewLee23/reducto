Chairman's
     LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS


Once again, I am pleased to report that over the 12-month period covered by this
report your Fund continued to provide you with attractive monthly tax-free
income. For more details about the management strategy and performance of your
Fund, please see the Portfolio Manager's Comments and Performance Overview
sections of this report.

Given recent reports of a strengthening economy, some market commentators are
speculating about whether longer-term interest rates will soon begin to rise
substantially, mirroring the rise that has taken place in shorter-term rates. If
longer-term rates do begin to rise significantly, some have suggested that this
would be a signal to begin selling your holdings of fixed-income investments.


"IN FACT, A WELL-DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO MAY ACTUALLY HELP TO REDUCE YOUR OVERALL
INVESTMENT RISK OVER THE LONG TERM."


Nobody knows what the market will do in the future or what investments will turn
out to be tomorrow's best performers. But from our experience, we do know that a
well-balanced portfolio, structured and carefully monitored with the help of a
trusted investment professional, can be an important component in helping you
achieve your long-term financial goals. In fact, a well-diversified portfolio
may actually help to reduce your overall investment risk over the long term.
That is one reason why we believe that a municipal bond investment like your
Fund can be an important building block in a comprehensive investment program
designed to perform well in a variety of market conditions.

As an added convenience for you, I urge you to consider receiving future Fund
reports and other Fund information by e-mail and the Internet. Not only will you
be able to receive the information faster, but this also may help lower your
Fund's expenses. Sign up is quick and easy - see the inside front cover of this
report for instructions.

Earlier in 2005, The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc., which owned 79% of
Nuveen Investments, Inc. (the parent of your Fund's investment adviser), sold a
substantial portion of its stake in Nuveen. More recently, St. Paul sold the
balance of its shares to Nuveen Investments or to others. Please be assured that
these transactions only affect Nuveen's corporate structure, and they do not
have any impact on the investment objectives or management of your Fund.

At Nuveen Investments, our mission continues to be to assist you and your
financial advisor by offering investment services and products that can help you
to secure your financial objectives. We are grateful that you have chosen us as
a partner as you pursue your financial goals, and we look forward to continuing
to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD, NXZ, NZF


Portfolio Manager's
        COMMENTS



Portfolio manager Tom Spalding discusses the economic and municipal market
environments, key investment strategies and the annual performance of these six
Funds. With 30 years of investment experience at Nuveen, Tom has managed NXZ
since its inception in 2001 and NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD and NZF since 2003.


WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE 12-MONTH
PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2005?

Between November 1, 2004, and October 31, 2005, the Federal Reserve implemented
eight 0.25% increases in the closely-watched fed funds rate. These increases,
which were aimed at controlling the pace of inflation, raised this short-term
target rate to 3.75% from 1.75%. (On November 1, 2005, and December 13, 2005,
the fed funds rate was increased by 0.25% to reach 4.25%.) Over this same
12-month period, shorter-term municipal market rates also rose significantly.

Longer-term yields declined throughout much of this period before rising toward
the end of the fiscal year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury
note ended October 2005 at 4.56%, compared with 4.03% one year earlier.
Longer-term yields in the municipal market followed a similar pattern, with the
yield on the Bond Buyer 25 Revenue Bond Index, a widely followed measure of
longer-term municipal market rates, ending the reporting period at 5.21%, an
increase of 24 basis points from October 31, 2004. Together, the steady rise in
shorter-term rates and the much more modest increase in longer rates over this
period produced an overall flattening of the yield curve, which generally led to
better relative performance for bonds with longer effective maturities and
poorer returns for bonds with shorter maturities or short call dates.

The economy continued to improve over the 12-month period. After expanding at an
annualized rate of 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2004, the U.S. gross domestic
product (GDP) grew by annualized rates of 3.8% in the first quarter of 2005,
3.3% in the second quarter and 3.8% in the third quarter. The overall employment
picture showed some improvement, with national unemployment at 5.0% in October
2005, down from 5.5% in October 2004. However, the 4.3% year-over-year increase
in the Consumer Price Index as of October 2005 raised some inflation concerns.

Over the 12 months ended October 2005, municipal bond new issue supply
nationwide remained strong, as $363.4 billion in new securities came to market.
A major factor behind this strong supply was the flattening yield curve, which
made advance refundings


                                       4

<PAGE>

more economically attractive for many issuers. (Advance refundings, also known
as pre-refundings or refinancings, occur when an issuer sells new bonds and uses
the proceeds to fund the principal and interest payments of older, previously
issued bonds that carry a higher coupon rate. This process usually results in
lower total borrowing costs for bond issuers.) Between January and October 2005,
pre-refunding volume was nearly 50% higher than during the same period in 2004,
as issuers sought to take advantage of the current interest rate environment.

WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THE 12 MONTHS ENDED
OCTOBER 31, 2005?

With rising short-term interest rates and the overall flattening of the yield
curve, our focus during this period centered on finding attractive bonds that we
believed would add value to the Funds' portfolios and that, in our judgment,
also had the potential to perform well under a variety of future market
scenarios, regardless of economic or interest rate trends.

In general, our purchase activity centered on buying bonds that matured in about
25 years and that had about 10 years of call protection. In our opinion, bonds
with these maturity and call protection characteristics offered more attractive
opportunities and the best values during this period. In particular, we looked
for attractively priced premium bonds - bonds that at the time of purchase were
trading above their par values because their coupons were higher than current
coupon levels. Historically, premium bonds have held their value better than
current coupon bonds when interest rates have risen. Premium bonds also are good
candidates for advance refundings, and trading pre-refunded bonds at opportune
times in the interest rate cycle has historically been a key strategy for adding
value to these Funds.

Overall, the ample new issue supply during this period provided us with
opportunities to find the types of bonds we were seeking. While our main focus
was on the 25-year part of the yield curve, we kept an opportunistic eye toward
all types of issuance that we believed could add value to the Funds' portfolios.
In general, we were buying essential services revenue bonds that would also help
us keep the Funds well diversified geographically. Lower-rated bonds generally
were in great demand during this period, and as a result we did not find many
attractive opportunities among lower-rated issues to add securities that we
believed would enhance value. As a result, the majority of our purchase activity
focused on higher quality bonds, especially during the second half of this
12-month period.


                                       5

<PAGE>

In NXZ, our strategy also included the use of forward interest rate swaps, a
type of derivative financial instrument. As discussed in our last shareholder
report, we began using these swaps in late 2004 in an effort to reduce some of
NXZ's interest rate risk. These hedges were not an attempt to profit from
correctly predicting the timing and direction of interest rate movements.
Instead, our sole objective was to reduce the interest rate risk of the Fund
without having a negative impact on its income stream or common share dividends
over the short term. We believe the hedging strategy was effective in achieving
the intended goal of helping to reduce NXZ's net asset value (NAV) volatility,
and in September 2005, we removed the hedge from this Fund. However, during the
period that the hedge was in place, it had a slight negative impact on NXZ's
performance, which affected the Fund's total return for the entire reporting
period. The negative impact was caused by the decline of long-term interest
rates during much of the period the hedge was in place, which resulted in a
decline in the value of the hedge as the value of the Fund's portfolio rose.

1    The Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index is an unleveraged, unmanaged
     national index comprising a broad range of investment-grade municipal
     bonds. Results for the Lehman Brothers index do not reflect any expenses.

2    The Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds category average is
     calculated using the returns of all closed-end exchange-traded funds in
     this category for each period as follows: 1 year, 64 funds; 5 years, 48
     funds; and 10 years, 43 funds. Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment
     of dividends.


                                       6

<PAGE>

For the 12 months ended October 31, 2005, the total returns on NAV for all six
of the Funds in this report exceeded the return on the Lehman Brothers Municipal
Bond Index. NXZ and NZF also outperformed the average return for their Lipper
peer group for this period, while NPP, NMA, NMO and NAD underperformed this peer
average.

One of the factors that, on balance, benefited the 12-month performance of these
Funds relative to that of the unleveraged Lehman Brothers index was the Funds'
use of financial leverage, even though increases in longer-term municipal bond
rates caused the value of the Funds' holdings to fall, and the Funds' financial
leverage exacerbated this decline in value. Leveraging can provide opportunities
for enhanced income for common shareholders when short-term interest rates
remain below the yields of the bonds purchased for the Funds' portfolios. This
continued to be the case during these 12 months. At the same time, leveraging
can add volatility to a Fund's NAV and share price, and can act to constrain
overall Fund performance during periods when interest rates rise. This was
evident during this reporting period.

As noted earlier, longer maturity bonds generally performed better than
securities with shorter maturities over the course of this 12-month period.
Yield curve positioning or, more specifically, heavier exposure to the longer
end of the yield curve helped the performances of NXZ and NZF, which were
established in 2001. The other four Funds, which were introduced between 1989
and 1999, had relatively greater exposures to the shorter end of the yield
curve. One of our ongoing tasks is to more closely align the yield curve
positioning of all of these Funds.

Each of these Funds benefited during this period from their allocations of
lower-rated bonds, as these bonds generally outperformed higher-rated credits.
As of October 31, 2005, allocations of bonds rated BBB or lower and non-rated
bonds accounted for 10% of NMO's portfolio, 12% of NPP, 15% of NAD, 18% of NZF,
19% of NMA and 20% of NXZ.

Among the specific securities making contributions to the Funds' total returns
for this period were bonds backed by the 1998 master tobacco settlement
agreement as the litigation environment improved and supply/demand dynamics
drove tobacco bond prices higher. Each Fund had about 5% to 6% of their
portfolio in uninsured tobacco bonds as of October 31, 2005. Lower-rated
hospital holdings also contributed positively to the Funds' total returns, as
the healthcare sector ranked second in performance among the Lehman municipal
revenue sectors for the period.

An additional factor in the performance differential among these Funds was their
relative weightings of zero coupon bonds. These bonds do not make periodic
interest payments


                                       7

<PAGE>

and therefore typically have very long initial maturities. The prices of these
bonds tend to be very sensitive to changes in interest rates. Zero coupon bonds
in the Lehman Municipal Bond Index outperformed the general market by 130 basis
points.

In addition to yield curve positioning, credit exposure, and specific holdings,
another factor in the Funds' performances during this period was advance
refundings. Refinancings rose sharply during this period, and the Funds'
performances benefited from the amount of their portfolios that became advance
refunded and the timing of these events. Generally, newly refunded bonds receive
a higher credit rating, which usually translates to a higher price.

While newly pre-refunded bonds tended to enhance the Funds' returns, the Funds'
holdings of older, previously pre-refunded bonds tended to underperform the
general municipal market during this period, primarily because of the shorter
effective maturities of these bonds. This was especially true in NPP and NMO.


HOW WERE THE FUNDS POSITIONED IN TERMS OF CREDIT QUALITY AND BOND CALLS AS OF
OCTOBER 31, 2005?

We continued to believe that maintaining strong credit quality was an important
requirement. As of October 31, 2005, all six of these Funds continued to offer
excellent credit quality, with allocations of bonds rated AAA/U.S. guaranteed
and AA ranging from 68% in NXZ to 77% in NMA, 80% in NZF, 83% in NAD and 84% in
NPP and NMO.

As of October 31, 2005, potential call exposure for the period from November
2005 through the end of 2006 ranged from 3% in NZF to 4% in NXZ, 6% in NMO, 9%
in NAD, and 10% in NMA and NPP. The number of actual bond calls in all of these
Funds depends largely on future market interest rates.

               Dividend and Share Price
                      INFORMATION



All of the Funds in this report use leverage to enhance opportunities for
additional income for common shareholders. The extent of this benefit is tied in
part to the short-term rates these Funds pay their MuniPreferred(R)
shareholders. During periods of low short-term rates, leveraged Funds generally
pay lower dividends to their MuniPreferred(R) shareholders, which can leave more
earnings to support common share dividends. However, when short-term interest
rates rise, as they did during this reporting period, the Funds' borrowing costs
also rise. While leveraging still provided benefits for common shareholders, the
extent of these benefits was reduced. This resulted in one monthly dividend
reduction in NZF and two in NPP, NMA, NMO and NAD over the 12-month period ended
October 31, 2005. The dividend of NXZ remained stable throughout this reporting
period.

In addition, due to normal portfolio activity, common shareholders of the

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of October 31, 2005, all of
the Funds in this report had positive UNII balances for both financial statement
and tax purposes.

1    Taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the taxable-equivalent yield is lower.

1    Taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the taxable-equivalent yield is lower.

1    Taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the taxable-equivalent yield is lower.

1    Taxable-equivalent yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the taxable-equivalent yield is lower.

NUVEEN MUNICIPAL MARKET OPPORTUNITY FUND, INC.
NUVEEN DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND
NUVEEN DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND 2
NUVEEN DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND 3


We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 2 and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 as of October
31, 2005, and the related statements of operations for the year then ended, the
statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then
ended, and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated therein.
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2005, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers
were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 and Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund 3 at October 31, 2005, and the results of their
operations for the year then ended, changes in their net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and their financial highlights for each of
the periods indicated therein in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.

                    #    On December 9, 2002, UAL Corporation, the holding
                         company of United Air Lines, Inc., filed for federal
                         bankruptcy protection. The Adviser determined that it
                         was likely United would not remain current on their
                         interest payment obligations with respect to these
                         bonds and thus has stopped accruing interest.

                    (a)  The issuer has received a preliminary adverse
                         determination from the Internal Revenue Service (the
                         "IRS") regarding the tax-exempt status of the bonds'
                         coupon payments. The Fund will continue to treat coupon
                         payments as tax-exempt income until such time that it
                         is formally determined that the interest on the bonds
                         should be treated as taxable.

                    #    On December 9, 2002, UAL Corporation, the holding
                         company of United Air Lines, Inc., filed for federal
                         bankruptcy protection. The Adviser determined that it
                         was likely United would not remain current on their
                         interest payment obligations with respect to these
                         bonds and thus has stopped accruing interest.

                    (a)  The issuer has received a preliminary adverse
                         determination from the Internal Revenue Service (the
                         "IRS") regarding the tax-exempt status of the bonds'
                         coupon payments. The Fund will continue to treat coupon
                         payments as tax-exempt income until such time that it
                         is formally determined that the interest on the bonds
                         should be treated as taxable.

Notes to
       FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds (the "Funds") covered in this report and their corresponding Common
share stock exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.
(NPP), Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market
Opportunity Fund, Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD),
Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 3 (NZF). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA),
Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the New York
Stock Exchange while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)
are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations
issued by state and local government authorities or certain U.S. territories.

Effective January 1, 2005, Nuveen Advisory Corp. ("NAC"), the Funds' previous
Adviser, and its affiliate, Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp. ("NIAC"), were
merged into Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM"), each wholly owned subsidiaries of
Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen"). As a result of the merger, NAM is now the
Adviser to all funds previously advised by either NAC or NIAC.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation
The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service establishes fair market value based
on yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of derivative investments are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. If the
pricing service is unable to supply a price for a municipal bond or derivative
investment, each Fund may use a market price or fair market value quote provided
by a major broker/dealer in such investments. If it is determined that the
market price or fair market value for an investment are unavailable or
inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of the Funds, or its designee,
may establish a fair value for the investment. Temporary investments in
securities that have variable rate and demand features qualifying them as
short-term investments are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market
value.

Investment Transactions
Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis may have
extended settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued and delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2005,
Performance Plus (NPP) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) had outstanding when-issued
purchase commitments of $3,510,675 and $1,500,000, respectively. There were no
such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the other Funds.

Investment Income
Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Investment income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any.

Professional Fees
Professional fees presented in the Statement of Operations consist of legal fees
incurred in the normal course of operations, audit fees, tax consulting fees
and, in some cases, workout expenditures. Workout expenditures are incurred in
an attempt to protect or enhance an investment, or to pursue other claims or
legal actions on behalf of Fund shareholders. Legal fee refunds presented on the
Statement of Operations for Municipal Advantage (NMA) and Dividend Advantage 2
(NXZ) reflect a refund of workout expenditures paid in a prior reporting period.

Federal Income Taxes
Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all net investment income and net capital
gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from regular federal income tax, to retain
such tax-exempt status when distributed to shareholders of the Funds. All
monthly tax-exempt income dividends paid dur-


                                       76

<PAGE>

ing the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, have been designated Exempt Interest
Dividends. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income distributions paid by
the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders
Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders not less frequently than annually.
Furthermore, capital gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed
available capital loss carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Preferred Shares
The Funds have issued and outstanding Preferred shares, $25,000 stated value per
share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each Fund's Preferred shares
are issued in more than one Series. The dividend rate paid by the Funds on each
Series is determined every seven days, pursuant to a dutch auction process
overseen by the auction agent, and is payable at the end of each rate period.
The number of Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each
Fund is as follows:

Forward Swap Transactions
The Funds are authorized to invest in certain derivative financial instruments.
The Funds' use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to
mitigate the negative impact that an increase in long-term interest rates could
have on Common share net asset value. Forward interest rate swap transactions
involve each Fund's agreement with the counterparty to pay, in the future, a
fixed rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a variable
rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a specified date in the
future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment obligation is based on
the notional amount of the forward swap contract, and would increase or decrease
in value based primarily on the extent to which long-term interest rates for
bonds having a maturity of the swaps' termination date were to increase or
decrease. The Funds may close out a contract prior to the effective date, at
which point a realized gain or loss would be recognized. When a forward swap is
terminated, it ordinarily does not involve the delivery of securities or other
underlying assets or principal, but rather is settled in cash on a net basis.
Each Fund intends, but is not obligated to, terminate its forward swaps before
the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of loss with respect to the swap
counterparty on such transactions is limited to the credit risk associated with
a counterparty failing to honor its commitment to pay any realized gain to the
Fund upon termination. To minimize such credit risk, all counterparties are
required to pledge collateral daily (based on the daily valuation of each swap)
on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately equal to the amount of any
unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold. Reciprocally, when any of the
Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract, the Funds have instructed the
custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as collateral with a value approximately
equal to the amount of the unrealized loss above a pre-determined threshold.
Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the swap
valuations fluctuate, either up or down, by at least the predetermined threshold
amount. At October 31, 2005, the Funds did not have any forward swap contracts
outstanding.

Custodian Fee Credit
Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by credits earned on each Fund's cash on deposit
with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments.

Indemnifications
Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Director/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

5. MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by the
Adviser, and a specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets
within each individual Fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund
shareholders to benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as
well as from growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the

The annual complex-level fee, payable monthly, which is additive to the
fund-level fee, for all Nuveen sponsored funds in the U.S., is based on the
aggregate amount of total fund assets managed as stated in the table below. As
of October 31, 2005, the complex-level fee rate was .1905%.

(1)  The complex-level fee component of the management fee for the funds is
     calculated based upon the aggregate Managed Assets ("Managed Assets" means
     the average daily net assets of each fund including assets attributable to
     all types of leverage used by the Nuveen funds) of Nuveen-sponsored funds
     in the U.S.

(2)  With respect to the complex-wide Managed Assets over $91 billion, the fee
     rate or rates that will apply to such assets will be determined at a later
     date. In the unlikely event that complex-wide Managed Assets reach $91
     billion prior to a determination of the complex-level fee rate or rates to
     be applied to Managed Assets in excess of $91 billion, the complex-level
     fee rate for such complex-wide Managed Assets shall be .1400% until such
     time as a different rate or rates is determined.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to their Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with the
Adviser or to their Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Dividend Advantage's (NAD) operations, the Adviser

6. ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING PARENT COMPANY OF ADVISER

In early April, 2005, The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul
Travelers"), which owned 79% of Nuveen, (A) completed a public offering of a
substantial portion of its equity stake in Nuveen, (B) sold Nuveen $200 million
of its Nuveen shares, (C) entered into an agreement with Nuveen to sell an
additional $400 million of its Nuveen shares on a "forward" basis with payment
for and settlement of these shares delayed for several months, and (D) entered
into agreements with two unaffiliated investment banking firms to sell an amount
equal to most or all of its remaining Nuveen shares for current payment but for
future settlement. Transactions (C) and (D) above were settled in late July,
which effectively reduced St. Paul Travelers' controlling stake in Nuveen and
was deemed an "assignment" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the investment
management agreements between the Funds and the Adviser, which resulted in the
automatic termination of each agreement under the 1940 Act. In anticipation of
such deemed assignment, the Board of Directors/Trustees had approved new ongoing
investment management agreements for each Fund and the submission of those
agreements for approval by each respective Fund's shareholders, which
shareholder approval was received prior to the settlement of transactions (C)
and (D). The new ongoing management agreements took effect upon such settlement.

               ANNUAL INVESTMENT
               MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
               APPROVAL PROCESS


At a meeting held on May 10-12, 2005, the Board of Trustees of the Funds,
including the independent Trustees, unanimously approved the Investment
Management Agreement between each Fund and NAM.

THE APPROVAL PROCESS
To assist the Board in its evaluation of an advisory contract with NAM, the
independent Trustees received a report in adequate time in advance of their
meeting which outlined, among other things, the services provided by NAM; the
organization of NAM, including the responsibilities of various departments and
key personnel; the Fund's past performance as well as the Fund's performance
compared to funds of similar investment objectives compiled by an independent
third party (a "Peer Group"); the profitability of NAM and certain industry
profitability analyses for advisers to unaffiliated investment companies; the
expenses of NAM in providing the various services; the management fees of NAM,
including comparisons of such fees with the management fees of comparable funds
in its Peer Group as well as comparisons of NAM's management fees with the fees
NAM assesses to other types of investment products or accounts, if any; the soft
dollar practices of NAM; and the expenses of each Fund, including comparisons of
the Fund's expense ratios (after any fee waivers) with the expense ratios of its
Peer Group. This information supplements that received by the Board throughout
the year regarding Fund performance, expense ratios, portfolio composition,
trade execution and sales activity.

In addition to the foregoing materials, independent legal counsel to the
independent Trustees provided, in advance of the meeting, a legal memorandum
outlining, among other things, the duties of the Trustees under the 1940 Act as
well as the general principles of relevant state law in reviewing and approving
advisory contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; an
adviser's fiduciary duty with respect to advisory agreements and compensation;
the standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards of
directors have fulfilled their duties and factors to be considered by the board
in voting on advisory agreements.

At the Board meeting, NAM made a presentation to and responded to questions from
the Board. After the presentations and after reviewing the written materials,
the independent Trustees met privately with their legal counsel to review the
Board's duties in reviewing advisory contracts and consider the renewal of the
advisory contracts. It is with this background that the Trustees considered each
Investment Management Agreement with NAM. The independent Trustees, in
consultation with independent counsel, reviewed the factors set out in judicial
decisions and SEC directives relating to the renewal of advisory contracts. As
outlined in more detail below, the Trustees considered all factors they believed
relevant with respect to each Fund, including the following: (a) the nature,
extent and quality of the services to be provided by NAM; (b) the investment
performance of the Fund and NAM; (c) the costs of the services to be provided
and profits to be realized by NAM and its affiliates from the relationship with
the Fund; (d) the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the
Fund grows; and (e) whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the
benefit of Fund investors.

A. NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES
In evaluating the nature, extent and quality of NAM's services, the Trustees
reviewed information concerning the types of services that NAM or its affiliates
provide and are expected to provide to the Nuveen Funds; narrative and
statistical information concerning the Fund's performance record and how such
performance compares to the Fund's Peer Group; information describing NAM's
organization and its various departments, the experience and responsibilities of
key personnel, and available resources. In the discussion of key personnel, the
Trustees received materials regarding the changes or additions in personnel of
NAM. The Trustees further noted the willingness of the personnel of NAM to
engage in open, candid discussions with the Board. The Trustees further
considered the quality of NAM's investment process in making portfolio
management decisions, including any refinements or improvements to the portfolio
management processes, enhancements to technology and systems that are available
to portfolio managers, and any additions of new personnel which may strengthen
or expand the research and investment capabilities of NAM. In their review of
the advisory contracts for the fixed income funds, such as the Funds, the
Trustees also noted that Nuveen won the Lipper Award for Best Fund Family: Fixed
Income-Large Asset Class, for 2004. Given the Trustees' experience with the
Funds, other Nuveen funds and NAM, the Trustees noted that they were familiar
with and continue to have a good understanding of the organization, operations
and personnel of NAM.


                                       90

<PAGE>

In addition to advisory services, the independent Trustees considered the
quality of the administrative or non-advisory services provided. In this regard,
NAM provides the Funds with such administrative and other services (exclusive
of, and in addition to, any such services provided by others for the Funds) and
officers and other personnel as are necessary for the operations of the
respective Fund. In addition to investment management services, NAM and its
affiliates provide each Fund with a wide range of services, including: preparing
shareholder reports; providing daily accounting; providing quarterly financial
statements; overseeing and coordinating the activities of other service
providers; administering and organizing Board meetings and preparing the Board
materials for such meetings; providing legal support (such as helping to prepare
registration statements, amendments thereto and proxy statements and responding
to regulatory inquiries); and performing other Fund administrative tasks
necessary for the operation of the respective Fund (such as tax reporting and
fulfilling regulatory filing requirements). In addition, in evaluating the
administrative services, the Trustees considered, in particular, NAM's policies
and procedures for assuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations in
light of the new SEC regulations governing compliance. The Trustees noted NAM's
focus on compliance and its compliance systems. In their review, the Trustees
considered, among other things, the additions of experienced personnel to NAM's
compliance group and modifications and other enhancements to NAM's computer
systems. In addition to the foregoing, the Trustees also noted that NAM
outsources certain services that cannot be replicated without significant costs
or at the same level of expertise. Such outsourcing has been a beneficial and
efficient use of resources by keeping expenses low while obtaining quality
services.

In addition to the above, in reviewing the variety of additional services that
NAM or its affiliates must provide to closed-end funds, such as the Funds, the
independent Trustees determined that Nuveen's commitment to supporting the
secondary market for the common shares of its closed-end funds is particularly
noteworthy. In this regard, the Trustees noted Nuveen's efforts to sponsor
numerous forums for analysts and specialists regarding the various Nuveen
closed-end funds, its creation of a new senior position dedicated to providing
secondary market support services and enhancing communications with investors
and analysts, and its advertising and media relations efforts designed to raise
investor and analyst awareness of the closed-end funds.

With respect to services provided to municipal funds, including the Funds, the
Trustees also noted, among other things, the enhancements NAM implemented to its
municipal portfolio management processes (e.g., the increased use of benchmarks
to guide and assess the performance of its portfolio managers); the
implementation of a risk management program; and the various initiatives being
undertaken to enhance or modify NAM's computer systems as necessary to support
the innovations of the municipal investment team (such as, the ability to assess
certain historical data in order to create customized benchmarks, perform
attribution analysis and facilitate the use of derivatives as hedging
instruments). With respect to certain of the Nuveen funds with a less seasoned
portfolio, the Trustees also noted the hedging program implemented for such
funds and the team responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring the
hedging procedures. The hedging program was designed to help maintain the
applicable fund's duration with certain benchmarks.

Based on their review, the Trustees concluded that, overall, they were satisfied
with the nature, extent and quality of services provided (and expected to be
provided) to the Funds under the Investment Management Agreements.

B. THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND AND ADVISER
As previously noted, the Board received a myriad of performance information
regarding each Fund and its Peer Group. Among other things, the Board received
materials reflecting a Fund's historic performance and the Fund's performance
compared to its Peer Group. In evaluating the performance information, in
certain limited instances, the Trustees noted that the closest Peer Group for a
Fund still would not adequately reflect such Fund's investment objectives and
strategies, thereby limiting the usefulness of the comparisons of such Fund's
performance with that of the Peer Group.

As noted above, the performance data included, among other things, the
respective Fund's performance relative to its peers. More specifically, a Fund's
one-, three- and five-year total returns (as applicable) for the periods ending
December 31, 2004 were evaluated relative to the unaffiliated funds in its
respective Peer Group (including the returns of individual peers as well as the
Peer Group average) as well as additional performance information with respect
to all funds in the Peer Group. Based on their review, the Trustees determined
that the respective Fund's absolute and relative investment performance over
time had been satisfactory.

C. FEES, EXPENSES AND PROFITABILITY
   1. FEES AND EXPENSES
   In evaluating the management fees and expenses that a Fund is expected to
   bear, the Trustees considered the respective Fund's current management fee
   structure and the Fund's expected expense ratios in absolute terms as well as
   compared with the fees and expense ratios of the unaffiliated funds in its
   Peer Group. The Trustees reviewed the financial information of NAM, including
   its respective revenues, expenses and profitability. In reviewing fees, the
   Trustees, among other things, reviewed comparisons of the Fund's gross
   management fees (fees after fund-level and complex-wide level breakpoints but
   before reimbursement and fee waivers), net management fees (after breakpoints
   and reimbursements and fee waivers) and total expense ratios (before and
   after waivers) with those of the unaffiliated funds in the Peer Group and
   peer averages. In this regard, the Trustees noted that the relative ranking
   of the Nuveen funds on fees and expenses was aided by the significant level
   of fee reductions provided by the fund-level and complex-wide breakpoint
   schedules, and the fee waivers and reimbursements provided by Nuveen for
   certain funds launched since 1999. The complex-wide breakpoint schedule was
   instituted in 2004 and is described in further detail below in Section D
   entitled "Economies of Scale and Whether Fee Levels Reflect these Economies
   of Scale." In their review of the fee and expense information provided,
   including, in particular, the expense ratios of the unaffiliated funds in the
   respective Peer Group, the Trustees determined that each Fund's net total
   expense ratio was within an acceptable range compared to such peers.

   2. COMPARISONS WITH THE FEES OF OTHER CLIENTS
   The Trustees further compared the fees of NAM to the fees NAM assessed for
   other types of clients investing in municipal funds (such as municipal
   managed accounts). With respect to such separately managed accounts, the
   advisory fees for such accounts are generally lower than those charged to the
   comparable Funds. The Trustees noted, however, the additional services that
   are provided and the costs incurred by Nuveen in managing and operating
   registered investment companies, such as the Funds, compared to individually
   managed separate accounts. For instance, as described above, NAM and its
   affiliates provide numerous services to the Funds including, but not limited
   to, preparing shareholder reports; providing daily accounting; preparing
   quarterly financial statements; overseeing and coordinating the activities of
   other service providers; administering and organizing Board meetings and
   preparing the Board materials for such meetings; providing legal support; and
   administering all other aspects of the Fund's operations. Further, the
   Trustees noted the increased compliance requirements for funds in light of
   new SEC regulations and other legislation. These services are generally not
   required to the same extent, if at all, for separate accounts. In addition to
   the differences in services, the Trustees also considered, among other
   things, the differences in product distribution, investment policies,
   investor profiles and account sizes. Accordingly, the Trustees believe that
   the nature and number of services provided to operate a Fund merit the higher
   fees than those to separate managed accounts.

   3. PROFITABILITY OF NAM
   In conjunction with its review of fees, the Trustees also considered NAM's
   profitability. The Trustees reviewed NAM's revenues, expenses and
   profitability margins (on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis). In reviewing
   profitability, the Trustees recognized that one of the most difficult issues
   in determining profitability is establishing a method of allocating expenses.
   Accordingly, the Trustees reviewed NAM's assumptions and methodology of
   allocating expenses. In this regard, the methods of allocation used appeared
   reasonable but the Board noted the inherent limitations in allocating costs
   among various advisory products. The Trustees also recognized that individual
   fund or product line profitability of other advisers is generally not
   publicly available. Further, profitability may be affected by numerous
   factors including the types of funds managed, expense allocations, business
   mix, etc. and therefore comparability of profitability is somewhat limited.
   Nevertheless, to the extent available, the Trustees considered NAM's profit
   margin compared to the profitability of various publicly-traded investment
   management companies and/or investment management companies that publicly
   disclose some or all of their financial results compiled by three independent
   third-party service providers. The Trustees also reviewed the revenues,
   expenses and profit margins of various unaffiliated advisory firms with
   similar amounts of assets under management for the last year prepared by NAM.
   Based on their review, the Trustees were satisfied that NAM's level of
   profitability from its relationship with each Fund was reasonable in light of
   the services provided.

   In evaluating the reasonableness of the compensation, the Trustees also
   considered any other revenues paid to NAM as well as any indirect benefits
   (such as soft dollar arrangements, if any) NAM and its affiliates are
   expected to receive that are directly attributable to their management of the
   Funds, if any. See Section E below for additional information. Based on their
   review of the overall fee arrangements of the applicable Fund, the Trustees
   determined that the advisory fees and expenses of the respective Fund were
   reasonable.

D. ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT THESE ECONOMIES OF SCALE
In reviewing the compensation, the Trustees have long understood the benefits of
economies of scale as the assets of a fund grow and have sought to ensure that
shareholders share in these benefits. One method for shareholders to share in
economies of scale is to include breakpoints in the advisory fee schedules that
reduce fees as fund assets grow. Accordingly, the Trustees received and reviewed
the schedules of advisory fees for each Fund, including fund-level breakpoints
thereto. In addition, after lengthy negotiations with management, the Board in
May, 2004 approved a complex-wide fee arrangement pursuant to which fees of the
funds in the Nuveen complex, including the Funds, are reduced as the assets in
the fund complex reach certain levels. The complex-wide fee arrangement was
introduced on August 1, 2004 and the Trustees reviewed data regarding the
reductions of fees for the Nuveen funds for the period of August 1, 2004 to
December 31, 2004. In evaluating the complex-wide fee arrangement, the Trustees
considered, among other things, the historic and expected fee savings to
shareholders as assets grow, the amount of fee reductions at various asset
levels, and that the arrangement would extend to all funds in the Nuveen
complex. The Trustees also considered the impact, if any, the complex-wide fee
arrangement may have on the level of services provided. Based on their review,
the Trustees concluded that the breakpoint schedule and complex-wide fee
arrangement currently were acceptable and desirable in providing benefits from
economies of scale to shareholders.

<PAGE>

E. INDIRECT BENEFITS
In evaluating fees, the Trustees also considered any indirect benefits or
profits NAM or its affiliates may receive as a result of its relationship with
each Fund. In this regard, the Trustees considered any benefits from soft dollar
arrangements. The Trustees noted that although NAM manages a large amount of
assets, it has very little, if any, brokerage to allocate. This is due to the
fact that NAM typically manages the portfolios of the municipal funds in the
Nuveen complex and municipal bonds generally trade on a principal basis.
Accordingly, NAM does not currently have any soft dollar arrangements and does
not pay excess brokerage commissions (or spreads on principal transactions) in
order to receive research services. In addition to soft dollar arrangements, the
Trustees also considered any other revenues, if any, received by NAM or its
affiliates. In this regard, the Trustees considered revenues received by Nuveen
for serving as agent for broker-dealers at its preferred trading desk and for
acting as co-manager in the initial public offering of new closed-end
exchange-traded funds.

F. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
Nuveen, until recently, was a majority-owned subsidiary of St. Paul Travelers
Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul"). As noted, St. Paul earlier this year announced its
intention to divest its equity stake in Nuveen. Nuveen is the parent of NAM.
Pursuant to a series of transactions, St. Paul had begun to reduce its interest
in Nuveen which will ultimately result in a change of control of Nuveen and
therefore NAM. As mandated by the 1940 Act, such a change in control would
result in an assignment of the Investment Management Agreements with NAM and the
automatic termination of such agreements. Accordingly, the Board also considered
the approval of a New Investment Management Agreement with each Fund in light
of, and which would take effect upon, the anticipated change of control. More
specifically, the Board considered for each Fund a New Investment Management
Agreement on substantially identical terms to the existing Investment Management
Agreement, to take effect after the change of control has occurred and the
contract has been approved by Fund shareholders. In its review, the Board
considered whether the various transactions necessary to divest St. Paul's
interest will have an impact on the various factors they considered in approving
NAM, such as the scope and quality of services to be provided following the
change of control. In reviewing the St. Paul transactions, the Board considered,
among other things, the impact, if any, on the operations and organizational
structure of NAM; the possible benefits and costs of the transactions to the
respective Fund; the potential implications of any arrangements used by Nuveen
to finance certain of the transactions; the ability of NAM to perform its duties
after the transactions; whether a fee structure or expense ratio would change;
any changes to the current practices of the respective Fund; any changes to the
terms of the advisory agreement; and any anticipated changes to the respective
operations of NAM. Based on its review, the Board determined that St. Paul's
divestiture would not affect the nature and quality of services provided by NAM,
the terms of the respective Investment Management Agreement, including the fees
thereunder, and would not materially affect the organization or operations of
NAM. Accordingly, the Board determined that their analysis of the various
factors regarding their approval of NAM would continue to apply after the change
of control.

G. APPROVAL
The Trustees did not identify any single factor discussed previously as
all-important or controlling. The Trustees, including a majority of independent
Trustees, concluded that the terms of the Investment Management Agreements were
fair and reasonable, that NAM's fees are reasonable in light of the services
provided to each Fund, that the renewal of the NAM Investment Management
Agreements should be approved and that the new, post-change of control NAM
Investment Managements Agreement be approved and recommended to shareholders.

Reinvest Automatically
       EASILY AND CONVENIENTLY


Sidebar text: NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET
UP YOUR REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN EXCHANGE-TRADED CLOSED-END FUNDS
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Exchange-Traded Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest
dividends and/or capital gains distributions in additional fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
then-current market price. If the shares are trading at less than net asset
value, shares for your account will be purchased on the open market. Dividends
and distributions received to purchase shares in the open market will normally
be invested shortly after the dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on
dividends and distributions awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of
the shares may increase before purchases are completed, the average purchase
price per share may exceed the market price at the time of valuation, resulting
in the acquisition of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable
brokerage commissions on open market purchases will be paid by Plan
participants. These commissions usually will be lower than those charged on
individual transactions.

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Other Useful
      INFORMATION



In April, 2005, The St. Paul Travelers Companies, Inc. ("St. Paul Travelers")
sold the majority of its controlling equity interest in Nuveen Investments, Inc.
("Nuveen") to the general public. Nuveen is the parent of Nuveen Asset
Management ("NAM"), which is each Fund's investment manager. This sale was
deemed to be an "assignment" of the investment management agreement between each
Fund and NAM and, if applicable, of the sub-advisory agreement between NAM and
the Fund's sub-adviser. As required by law, the shareholders of each Fund were
asked to approve a new investment management agreement and, if applicable, a new
subadvisory agreement that reflected this change in ownership. The shareholders
of each Fund voted this approval at a Shareholders' Meeting on July 26, 2005.
There were no changes to the investment objectives or management of any Fund as
a result of these actions.

CEO CERTIFICATION DISCLOSURE
Each Fund's Chief Executive Officer has submitted to the New York Stock Exchange
the annual CEO certification as required by Section 303A.12(a) of the NYSE
Listed Company Manual.

Each Fund has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the
certification of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THIS REPORT

AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period. It
expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal the
investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or market
price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if any) over the
time period being considered.

AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of all the maturities of the bonds in a
Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each maturity date (the date the
security comes due) by the market value of the security. This figure does not
account for the likelihood of prepayments or the exercise of call provisions.

LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period over
which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently is a
measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes when
market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's duration,
the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as interest rates change.
Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging process for a Fund
and therefore is longer than the duration of the Fund's portfolio of bonds.

MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An investment's
current annualized dividend divided by its current market price.

NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's common share NAV per share is calculated by
subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any MuniPreferred shares
issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then dividing
the remainder by the number of shares outstanding. Fund NAVs are calculated at
the end of each business day.

TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable investment to
equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond investment.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the registrant has adopted a

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees determined that the registrant
has at least one "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 3 of

financial expert is Jack B. Evans, Chairman of the Audit Committee, who is
"independent" for purposes of Item 3 of Form N-CSR.

Mr. Evans was formerly President and Chief Operating Officer of SCI Financial
Group, Inc., a full service registered broker-dealer and registered investment

the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.



                   Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3

The following tables show the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP, the Fund's
auditor, billed to the Fund during the Fund's last two full fiscal years. For
engagements with Ernst & Young LLP entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the
Audit Committee approved in advance all audit services and non-audit services
that Ernst & Young LLP provided to the Fund, except for those non-audit services
that were subject to the pre-approval exception under Rule 2-01 of Regulation
S-X (the "pre-approval exception"). The pre-approval exception for services
provided directly to the Fund waives the pre-approval requirement for services
other than audit, review or attest services if: (A) the aggregate amount of all
such services provided constitutes no more than 5% of the total amount of
revenues paid by the Fund to its accountant during the fiscal year in which the
services are provided; (B) the Fund did not recognize the services as non-audit
services at the time of the engagement; and (C) the services are promptly
brought to the Audit Committee's attention, and the Committee (or its delegate)
approves the services before the audit is completed.

The Audit Committee has delegated certain pre-approval responsibilities to its
Chairman (or, in his absence, any other member of the Audit Committee).

The above "Tax Fees" are primarily fees billed to the Adviser for Fund tax
return preparation.


                               NON-AUDIT SERVICES

The following table shows the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP billed
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years for non-audit services. For
engagements entered into on or after May 6, 2003, the Audit Committee is
required to pre-approve non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP provides to
the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Services Provider, if the engagement related
directly to the Fund's operations and financial reporting (except for those
subject to the de minimis exception described above). The Audit Committee
requested and received information from Ernst & Young LLP about any non-audit
services that Ernst & Young LLP rendered during the Fund's last fiscal year to
the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Service Provider. The Committee considered
this information in evaluating Ernst & Young LLP's independence.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, the audit
committee must approve (i) all non-audit services to be performed for the Fund
by the Fund's independent accountants and (ii) all audit and non-audit services
to be performed by the Fund's independent accountants for the Affiliated Fund
Service Providers with respect to operations and financial reporting of the
Fund. Regarding tax and research projects conducted by the independent
accountants for the Fund and Affiliated Fund Service Providers (with respect to
operations and financial reports of the Fund) such engagements will be (i)
pre-approved by the audit committee if they are expected to be for amounts
greater than $10,000; (ii) reported to the audit committee chairman for his
verbal approval prior to engagement if they are expected to be for amounts under
$10,000 but greater than $5,000; and (iii) reported to the audit committee at
the next audit committee meeting if they are expected to be for an amount under
$5,000.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees has a separately designated
audit committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)). The
members of the audit committee are Robert P. Bremner, Lawrence H. Brown, Jack B.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

In the rare event that a municipal issuer held by the Fund were to issue a proxy
or that the Fund were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security,
the Adviser would either engage an independent third party to determine how the
proxy should be voted or vote the proxy with the consent, or based on the
instructions, of the Fund's Board of Directors or Trustees or its
representative. In the case of a conflict of interest, the proxy would be
submitted to the applicable Fund's Board to determine how the proxy should be
voted. A member of the Adviser's legal department would oversee the
administration of the voting, and ensure that records were maintained in
accordance with Rule 204-2(c)(2) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (17
CFR 275.204-2(c)(2)), reports were filed with the SEC on Form N-PX, and the
results were provided to the Board of Directors or Trustees and made available
to shareholders as required by applicable rules.

recommend nominees to the registrant's Board implemented after the registrant
last provided disclosure in response to this Item.

     (a)  The registrant's principal executive and principal financial officers,
          or persons performing similar functions, have concluded that the
          registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule

          "1940 Act") (17 CFR 270.30a-3(c))) are effective, as of a date within
          90 days of the filing date of this report that includes the disclosure
          required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of the controls
          and procedures required by Rule 30a-3(b) under the 1940 Act (17 CFR
          270.30a-3(b)) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b) under the Securities
          Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")
          (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).

     (b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
          financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the second fiscal quarter
          of the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or
          is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.

exhibits in the sequence indicated.

(a)(1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant intends to
satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an exhibit: Not applicable
because the code is posted on registrant's website at www.nuveen.com/etf and
there were no amendments during the period covered by this report. (To view the
code, click on the Investor Resources drop down menu box, click on Fund
Governance and then Code of Conduct.)

(a)(2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2(a) under

that section. Such certification will not be deemed to be incorporated by
reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act,
except to the extent that the registrant specifically incorporates it by
reference. Ex-99.906 CERT attached hereto.
