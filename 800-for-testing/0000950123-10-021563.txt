             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE MEMBERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF
       UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C. (the "Fund"),  including the schedule
of portfolio investments, as of December 31, 2009, and the related statements of
operations and cash flows for the year then ended,  the statements of changes in
members'  capital for each of the two years in the period  then  ended,  and the
financial  highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These
financial  statements  and financial  highlights are the  responsibility  of the
Fund's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on  these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material  misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's  internal  control over  financial
reporting.  Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the
effectiveness  of  the  Fund's  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.
Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and the disclosures in the financial
statements and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
investments in investment funds as of December 31, 2009, by correspondence  with
management  of the  underlying  investment  funds.  We  believe  that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of UBS
Technology Partners,  L.L.C. at December 31, 2009, the results of its operations
and its cash flows for the year then ended,  the changes in its members' capital
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then  ended,  in  conformity  with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.


                                                             (ERNST & YOUNG LLP)

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2009

1.   ORGANIZATION

     UBS Technology  Partners,  L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized as a
     limited  partnership  under the laws of  Delaware  on  December  28,  1998,
     commenced operations on April 1, 1999 and was subsequently reorganized as a
     limited   liability  company  effective  October  15,  2002.  The  Fund  is
     registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940
     Act"), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. The
     Fund's  investment  objective is to maximize capital  appreciation over the
     long-term.  The Fund pursues its  investment  objective  by  deploying  its
     assets  primarily  among a select  group of  portfolio  managers who invest
     primarily  in, or who have  particular  knowledge  within,  the  technology
     sector.   Generally,  such  portfolio  managers  conduct  their  investment
     programs  through   unregistered   investment  funds   (collectively,   the
     "Investment  Funds")  in which the Fund  invests  as a limited  partner  or
     member along with other investors.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall  responsibility
     to manage and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
     exclusive  authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
     management,  conduct and  operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
     have  engaged  UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  ("UBSFA"  or the  "Manager"),  a
     Delaware limited  liability company and the Manager of the Fund, to provide
     investment  advice  regarding the  selection of Investment  Funds and to be
     responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Manager is an indirect wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
     which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG,  and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the  Directors may determine and are generally
     accepted monthly. The Directors reserve the right to reject any application
     for interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to
     written tenders to members (the "Members").  These repurchases will be made
     at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the  Directors,  in
     their  complete  and  exclusive   discretion.   The  Manager  expects  that
     generally,  it will  recommend  to the  Directors  that the  Fund  offer to
     repurchase  interests  from  Members  twice each year,  near  mid-year  and
     year-end.  Members can only transfer or assign their membership  interests,
     or a portion  thereof,  (i) by  operation  of law  pursuant  to the  death,
     bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii) with the written
     approval of the Directors, which may be withheld in their sole and absolute
     discretion.  Such  transfers may be made even if the balance of the capital
     account  to such  transferee  is  equal to or less  than  the  transferor's
     initial capital contribution.



                                                                               7

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2009

2.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     On June 30,  2009,  the Fund adopted new  accounting  guidance to determine
     whether  there has been a  significant  decrease in the volume and level of
     activity  for an  asset or  liability  when  compared  with  normal  market
     activity for such asset or liability  (or similar  assets and  liabilities)
     and identifying  circumstances  that indicate a transaction with regards to
     such an asset or liability is not  orderly.  The guidance  also expands the
     disclosures  of  fair  value  measurements  in  the  financial  statements.
     Adoption  of this  guidance  did not have a  material  impact on the Fund's
     members' capital or results of operations.

     In June 2009, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued THE
     FASB  ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS  CODIFICATION  AND THE  HIERARCHY  OF GENERALLY
     ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES  ("Codification").  The standard identifies
     the Codification as the single source of authoritative U.S.  accounting and
     reporting standards applicable for all non-governmental  entities, with the
     exception of guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange  Commission and
     its  staff.  The  Codification  did not  change  U. S.  generally  accepted
     accounting principles ("GAAP"),  but rather organized them into a hierarchy
     where all  guidance  within  the  Codification  carries  an equal  level of
     authority.  It is effective for financial statements issued for interim and
     fiscal years ending on or after  September 15, 2009. The  Codification  did
     not have a material effect on the Fund's financial statements.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The Fund  values its  investments  using fair value which is the price that
     would be received  to sell an asset or paid to  transfer a liability  in an
     orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

     Various  inputs  are  used in  determining  the fair  value  of the  Fund's
     investments which are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

     LEVEL 1-- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities
     LEVEL 2-- fair value of investments in Investment Funds with the ability to
     redeem at net asset value as of the measurement date, or within ninety days
     of the  measurement  date
     LEVEL 3-- fair value of  investments  in Investment  Funds that do not have
     the  ability  to  redeem  at net  asset  value  within  ninety  days of the
     measurement date

     GAAP provides guidance in determining  whether there has been a significant
     decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
     compared  with  normal  market  activity  for such asset or  liability  (or
     similar assets or liabilities).  GAAP also provides guidance on identifying
     circumstances  that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or
     liability is not orderly. In

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     its consideration,  the Fund must consider inputs and valuation  techniques
     used for each major category for  securities  with "major  category"  being
     defined as major security type. For assets and liabilities measured at fair
     value on a  recurring  basis  during  the  period,  the Fund  must  provide
     quantitative  disclosures about the fair value measurements  separately for
     each major category of assets and liabilities,  as well as a reconciliation
     of beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets and  liabilities  broken
     down by major category.

     The following is a summary of the investment  strategy and any restrictions
     on the liquidity  provisions of the investments in Investment Funds held in
     the  Fund as of  December  31,  2009.  Investment  Funds  with  no  current
     redemption  restrictions may be subject to future gates, lock-up provisions
     or other  restrictions,  in accordance with their offering  documents.  The
     Fund had no unfunded capital commitments as of December 31, 2009.

     The Investment Funds in the long/short  equity strategy invest in both long
     and short equity  strategies  are  primarily in United States common stocks
     focused in the technology  sector. The management of these Investment Funds
     has the ability to shift investments from value to growth strategies,  from
     small to large  capitalization  common stocks, and from a net long position
     to a  net  short  position.  Investment  Funds  within  this  strategy  are
     generally  subject  to a 30 - 90 day  redemption  notice  period and can be
     redeemed with no restrictions  as of the  measurement  date of December 31,
     2009.

     A detailed  depiction of each  investment  in the  portfolio by  investment
     strategy,  including any additional liquidity terms and other restrictions,
     as well as a breakdown  of the  portfolio  into the fair value  measurement
     levels,  can be  found in the  tables  within  the  Schedule  of  Portfolio
     Investments.

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
     Manager  as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
     accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set  forth  below or as may be
     determined  from  time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
     Directors.  The Fund's  investments in Investment  Funds are subject to the
     terms and  conditions of the respective  operating  agreements and offering
     memorandums, as appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
     carried  at  fair  value.  All  valuations  utilize  financial  information
     supplied by each  Investment Fund and are net of management and performance
     incentive fees or allocations  payable to the Investment Funds' managers or
     pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.   The  Fund's  valuation
     procedures  require  the  Manager  to  consider  all  relevant  information
     available  at the time the Fund  values  its  portfolio.  The  Manager  has
     assessed factors  including,  but not limited to the individual  Investment
     Funds'  compliance with fair value  measurements,  price  transparency  and
     valuation procedures in place,  subscription and redemption activity, level
     of  illiquid  securities  held,  and the  existence  or  absence of certain
     redemption restrictions. The Manager and/or the Directors

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     will consider such information and consider  whether it is appropriate,  in
     light of all  relevant  circumstances,  to value such a position at its net
     asset value as reported  or whether to adjust  such value.  The  underlying
     investments  of each  Investment  Fund are  accounted  for at fair value as
     described in each Investment Fund's financial statements.  (See Schedule of
     Portfolio Investments).

     The  fair  value  relating  to  certain  underlying  investments  of  these
     Investment Funds, for which there is no ready market, has been estimated by
     the  respective  Investment  Funds'  management and is based upon available
     information  in the absence of readily  ascertainable  fair values and does
     not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Due to
     the inherent  uncertainty  of valuation,  those  estimated  fair values may
     differ  significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready
     market for the investments existed. These differences could be material.

     The fair  value of the  Fund's  assets  and  liabilities  which  qualify as
     financial  instruments  approximates the carrying amounts  presented in the
     Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

     B.   INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME RECOGNITION

     The Fund  accounts  for  realized  gains and losses  from  Investment  Fund
     transactions  based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of the
     underlying  investment  at the  date of  redemption.  Interest  income  and
     expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.

     C.   FUND EXPENSES

     The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not
     limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
     and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value; costs of insurance; registration expenses; offering and organization
     costs; due diligence,  including travel and related  expenses;  expenses of
     meetings of Directors; all costs with respect to communications to Members;
     and other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Fund has  reclassified  $3,078,258 and $18,877,989 from accumulated net
     investment  loss  and  accumulated  net  realized  gain  from  investments,
     respectively,  to net capital  contributions during the year ended December
     31, 2009.  The  reclassification  was to reflect,  as an  adjustment to net
     contributions,  the amount of  estimated  taxable  income or loss that have
     been  allocated  to the Fund's  Members as of December  31, 2009 and had no
     effect on members' capital.



                                                                              10

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     D.   INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

     Management  has analyzed the Fund's tax positions  taken on federal  income
     tax returns for all open tax years (current and prior three tax years), and
     has concluded  that no provision for federal  income tax is required in the
     Fund's  financial  statements.  The  Fund's  federal  and state  income tax
     returns for tax years for which the applicable statutes of limitations have
     not expired are subject to examination by the Internal  Revenue Service and
     state departments of revenue.

     Each  Member is  individually  required to report on its own tax return its
     distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
     account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
     accrued interest which is included in interest  receivable on the Statement
     of Assets,  Liabilities  and Members'  Capital.  Such cash,  at times,  may
     exceed federally insured limits. The Fund has not experienced any losses in
     such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant  credit
     risk on such accounts.

     F.   USE OF ESTIMATES

     The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with GAAP requires
     management  to make  estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  reported
     amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and
     liabilities  at the  date of the  financial  statements  and  the  reported
     amounts of  increases  and  decreases in members'  capital from  operations
     during  the  reporting  period.  Actual  results  could  differ  from those
     estimates.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     UBSFA provides certain management and administrative  services to the Fund,
     including,  among other  things,  providing  office space and other support
     services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays UBSFA a monthly
     management fee (the "Management Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's
     members'  capital,  excluding  the  capital  account  attributable  to  the
     Manager.  The  Management Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's assets and
     debited  against the Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding  the Manager's
     capital  account.  A portion of the  Management Fee is paid by UBSFA to its
     affiliates.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
     Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
     compensation  from the Fund,  and bears its own costs  associated  with its
     activities  as  placement  agent.   Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
     contributions are debited against the contribution  amounts, to arrive at a
     net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute  assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase or decrease in members'  capital  derived from  operations
     (net income or loss) is initially  allocated to the capital accounts of all
     Members  on a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than the  Management  Fee  which is
     similarly  allocated  to all Members  other than the  Manager as  described
     above.  In accordance with the Limited  Liability  Company  Agreement,  the
     Manager is then  allocated an amount based on the  performance  of the Fund
     (the  "Performance  Bonus") for the Measurement  Period,  as defined in the
     Confidential  Memorandum (i.e., the period commencing on the admission of a
     Member  to the Fund,  and  thereafter  each  period  commencing  on the day
     following the last Measurement  Period and ending generally on the first to
     occur of (1) a fiscal year-end or (2) a whole or partial  redemption).  The
     Performance Bonus is calculated separately with respect to each Member.

     The Performance Bonus is equal to 1% of the balance of the Member's capital
     account at the end of the Measurement Period, provided that appreciation in
     the Member's  capital  account (net of any  Performance  Bonus) exceeds the
     Member's threshold return. The threshold return is the amount that a Member
     would have earned for a fiscal year if it had received an  annualized  rate
     of return of 20% on its opening capital account  balance,  as adjusted.  No
     Performance Bonus was earned for the year ended December 31, 2009.

     Each Director of the Fund receives an annual  retainer of $7,500 plus a fee
     for each meeting  attended.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors and the
     Chairman of the Audit  Committee of the Board of Directors  each receive an
     additional   annual  retainer  in  the  amounts  of  $10,000  and  $15,000,
     respectively.  These additional annual retainer amounts are paid for by the
     Fund on a  pro-rata  basis  with ten  other UBS  funds  where  UBSFA is the
     investment  adviser.  All  Directors  are  reimbursed  by the  Fund for all
     reasonable out of pocket expenses.

     Other investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
     may also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

5.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

     PNC Global Investment  Servicing (U.S.),  Inc. ("PNC"), a member of The PNC
     Financial  Services Group,  Inc., serves as  administrative  and accounting
     agent to the Fund, and in that capacity  provides  certain  administrative,
     accounting, record keeping, tax and investor related services. PNC receives
     a

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES (CONTINUED)

     monthly fee primarily  based upon (i) the average  members'  capital of the
     Fund  subject to a minimum  monthly fee,  and (ii) the  aggregate  members'
     capital of the Fund and certain other investment funds sponsored or advised
     by UBS Americas, Inc. or its affiliates.  Additionally, the Fund reimburses
     certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PNC.

     The  Custodian of the Fund's  assets  provides  custodial  services for the
     Fund.

6.   LOAN PAYABLE

     The Fund,  along with other funds under the same line of credit  agreement,
     also  managed  by  UBSFA   (together,   the   "Borrowers"),   maintained  a
     $200,000,000 committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit. On January 31,
     2009,  the  Borrowers  reduced  the  $200,000,000   committed,   unsecured,
     revolving  line of  credit  to  $75,000,000  through  July  28,  2009,  the
     remainder of its term which was not renewed by the Borrowers.

     For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Fund's average interest rate paid
     on borrowings  was 1.64% per annum and the average  borrowings  outstanding
     were  $213,699.  Interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 2009 was
     $3,496,  of which $0 is payable at December  31,  2009.  The Fund had $0 in
     borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2009.

7.   INVESTMENTS

     As of December 31, 2009 the Fund had investments in Investment  Funds, none
     of which were related parties.

     Aggregate  purchases and proceeds  from sales of  Investment  Funds for the
     year ended  December  31, 2009  amounted to  $36,000,000  and  $52,337,627,
     respectively.

     The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax  purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the  Investment  Funds.
     The  allocated  taxable  income is reported  to the Fund by the  Investment
     Funds on Schedule  K-1.  The Fund has not yet  received  all such  Schedule
     K-1's for the year ended December 31, 2009.

     The  agreements  related to  investments  in  Investment  Funds provide for
     compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of  management
     fees of 1.50% to 2.00% (per annum) of net assets and performance  incentive
     fees or allocations of 20.00% of net profits earned.  Detailed  information
     about the Investment Funds' portfolios is not available.

8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
     contracts for  differences,  and equity  swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
     these Investment Funds is limited to the fair value of these investments.

9.   INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into  contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against  the Fund.
     Based on its history and experience,  the Fund feels that the likelihood of
     such an event is remote.

10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     As of December 31, 2009, the Fund had  $21,194,367 of withdrawals  payable.
     On January  19,  2010,  the Fund paid  $19,683,675.  The  remaining  amount
     payable of $1,510,692 is scheduled to be paid in accordance  with the terms
     of the Fund's June 30, 2009 and December 31, 2009 tender offers.

     Management  has evaluated the impact of all  subsequent  events on the Fund
     through  February 23, 2010, the date the financial  statements were issued,
     and  has  determined  that  there  were  no  additional  subsequent  events
     requiring recognition or disclosure in the financial statements.

The following is a summary of the inputs used in valuing the Fund's  investments at fair value.  The inputs or methodology  used for
valuing the Fund's  investments are not necessarily an indication of the risk  associated with investing in those  investments.  The
Fund's valuation  procedures require  evaluation of all relevant factors available at the time the Fund values its portfolio.  These
relevant factors include the individual Investment Funds' compliance with fair value measurements,  price transparency and valuation
procedures in place,  subscription  and  redemption  activity,  level of illiquid  securities  held, and the existence or absence of
redemption restrictions.

The Fund's  investments are categorized in three levels as disclosed  below.  Level 1 discloses the amount of investments  where the
values of those investments are based upon quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. Level 2 discloses the amount of
investments  where the Fund has the ability to redeem at net asset value as of the December  31, 2009  measurement  date,  or within
ninety days of the measurement  date. Level 3 discloses the amount of investments where the Fund does not have the ability to redeem
at net asset value within ninety days of the December 31, 2009 measurement date.

                   UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C. (UNAUDITED)

     The Directors  (including  the  Independent  Directors)  last evaluated the
Investment  Advisory Agreement at a meeting on September 17, 2009. The Directors
met in an  executive  session  during  which  they were  advised  by and had the
opportunity  to discuss  with  independent  legal  counsel  the  approval of the
Investment Advisory Agreement. The Directors reviewed materials furnished by UBS
Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "Adviser"),  including  information  regarding the
Adviser,  its affiliates and its personnel,  operations and financial condition.
Tables  indicating  comparative fee  information,  and  comparative  performance
information,  as well as a summary  financial  analysis for the Fund,  were also
included in the meeting materials and were reviewed and discussed. The Directors
discussed  with  representatives  of the Adviser the Fund's  operations  and the
Adviser's ability to provide advisory and other services to the Fund.

     The  Directors  reviewed,  among other  things,  the nature of the advisory
services to be provided to the Fund by the  Adviser,  including  its  investment
process,  and the  experience  of the  investment  advisory and other  personnel
proposing to provide  services to the Fund. The Directors  discussed the ability
of the Adviser to manage the Fund's  investments  in accordance  with the Fund's
stated  investment  objectives  and  policies,  as  well as the  services  to be
provided by the Adviser to the Fund,  including  administrative  and  compliance
services,  oversight  of Fund  accounting,  marketing  services,  assistance  in
meeting legal and regulatory  requirements and other services  necessary for the
operation of the Fund. The Directors  acknowledged  the Adviser's  employment of
highly skilled investment  professionals,  research analysts and administrative,
legal and  compliance  staff  members to ensure  that a high level of quality in
compliance  and  administrative  services  would be  provided  to the Fund.  The
Directors also recognized the benefits which the Fund derives from the resources
available to the Adviser and the Adviser's affiliates,  including UBS AG and UBS
Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial").  Accordingly, the Directors felt that
the quality of service offered by the Adviser to the Fund was  appropriate,  and
that the Adviser's personnel had sufficient expertise to manage the Fund.

     The  Directors  reviewed  the  performance  of the Fund and  compared  that
performance to the performance of other  investment  companies  presented by the
Adviser which had  objectives  and  strategies  similar to those of the Fund and
which are managed by other,  third-party  investment  advisers (the  "Comparable
Funds").  The Directors recognized that the Comparable Funds, private funds, are
not subject to certain investment  restrictions under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 that are applicable to the Fund of which can adversely affect the Fund's
performance  relative to that of the Comparable  Funds.  The Directors  observed
that for the  five-year  period  ended  July 31,  2009  the  Fund's  performance
exceeded that of its  Comparable  Funds.  The Directors also observed that while
the Fund's 2008 annualized  return  exceeded the 2008  annualized  return of the
HFRI Sector: Technology,  Morgan Stanley High Tech, NASDAQ Composite and S&P 500
DRI  indexes,  the Fund's 2009 return for the period  ended July 31, 2009 lagged
the returns of such indexes.  The Directors  also compared the volatility of the
Fund to that of the  Comparable  Funds.  The  Directors  observed  that  for the
five-year period ended July 31, 2009 the Fund's  volatility was below the median
volatility of its Comparable Funds.

     The Directors considered the advisory fees being charged by the Adviser for
its services to the Fund as compared to those charged to the  Comparable  Funds,
and as compared to the advisory  fees charged by the Adviser and its  affiliates
for other UBS alternative investment

<PAGE>

products.  The  information  presented to the  Directors  showed that the Fund's
management fee was lower than the management fee of one of its Comparable  Funds
and equal to the  management  fee of the other,  and its incentive fee was lower
than the  incentive  fees charged to its  Comparable  Funds.  In  comparing  the
advisory fees being charged to the Fund to the fees being charged by the Adviser
and its affiliates for other UBS alternative  investment products,  it was noted
that the management fee was equal to the lowest  management fee being charged to
the  other  UBS  alternative  investment  multi-manager  funds,  and the  Fund's
incentive fee was equal to the lowest incentive fee charged to the multi-manager
funds that have an  incentive  fee  structure.  In light of the  foregoing,  the
Directors  felt that the  combination  of management fee and incentive fee being
charged to the Fund was appropriate and was within the overall range of the fees
paid by the  Comparable  Funds and other  relevant  UBS  alternative  investment
products.

     The Directors also considered the  profitability of the Adviser both before
payment to brokers and after payment to brokers and  concluded  that the profits
to be realized by the Adviser  and its  affiliates  under the Fund's  Investment
Advisory Agreement and from other relationships between the Fund and the Adviser
were within a range the Directors  considered  reasonable and  appropriate.  The
Directors  also  discussed  the fact that the Fund was not large  enough at that
time to  support  a request  for  breakpoints  due to  economies  of scale.  The
Directors  determined that the fees under the Investment  Advisory Agreement did
not constitute fees that are so disproportionally large as to bear no reasonable
relationship  to the services  rendered and that could not have been the product
of arm's length  bargaining,  and concluded that the fees were  reasonable.  The
Directors  concluded that approval of the Investment  Advisory  Agreement was in
the best interests of the Fund and its investors.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.
                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

A. INTRODUCTION

     UBS Fund Advisor, L.L.C. (the "Adviser") votes proxies for each fund (each
a "Fund," collectively, the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and as
such, has adopted these Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies
and Procedures"). The Funds are funds of funds that invest primarily in
unregistered investment vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other
than the Fund. Generally, each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets
in non-voting securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do
not submit matters to investors for vote; however, should a matter be submitted
for vote and provided the Fund holds voting interests in the Investment Fund,
the Adviser will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the
Fund and in accordance with these Policies and Procedures. The Board of
Directors (the "Board") of the Funds has adopted these Policies and Procedures
as the Funds'. The Adviser will notify the Board of any changes to the Adviser's
Policies and Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

     Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process. The Adviser is under a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize shareholder value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the Adviser's part to analyze the issues connected with the votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

     Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent with management's recommendations on routine matters, absent a
particular reason to the contrary. Non-routine matters will be voted on a
case-by-case basis taking into consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

     Any circumstance or relationship which would compromise a portfolio
manager's objectivity in voting proxies in the best interest of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest. In such situations, the Adviser will
address any material conflicts before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy, the Adviser will presume the existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

<PAGE>

     -    A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment
          Fund soliciting proxies or has communicated its view to the Adviser on
          an impending proxy vote;

     -    The portfolio manager responsible for proxy-voting has identified a
          personal interest in the Investment Fund soliciting proxies or in the
          outcome of a shareholder vote;

     -    Members of the portfolio management team, including the portfolio
          manager responsible for proxy-voting, and/or members of senior
          management, have a personal interest through investment in the
          Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

     -    Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in
          the outcome of a shareholder vote have attempted to influence either
          the Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.

Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts of
interest that may result, on the part of the Adviser, from employees' personal
relationships or special circumstances that may result as part of the Adviser's
normal course of business. Employees who become aware of any such conflicts of
interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal who will work with appropriate personnel of the
Adviser to determine the materiality of the conflict.

     ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. A conflict of interest will be
considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances.

          If it is determined that a conflict of interest is not material, the
Adviser may vote proxies notwithstanding the existence of the conflict. The
Adviser shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified,
the materiality determination, and the method used to resolve the material
conflict of interest.

          If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the
Adviser's Chief Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate personnel
of the Adviser to determine a resolution before voting proxies affected by such
conflict of interest. Resolutions may include:

     -    Disclosing the conflict and obtaining consent before voting (which
          consent in the case of the Fund(s) may be obtained from the Fund's
          board of directors);

     -    Engaging another party on behalf of the Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
          its behalf;

     -    Engaging a third party to recommend a vote with respect to the proxy
          based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

     -    Such other method as is deemed appropriate under the circumstances
          given the nature of the conflict.

E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

     The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to
the Fund(s) during the preceding twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX,
no later than August 31st of the then year.

<PAGE>

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

     Where the Funds hold voting rights, the Funds shall include in their Form
N-CSR (Certified Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies and
Procedures; (ii) a statement that a description of these Policies and Procedures
is available without charge, upon request by taking the specified action; and
(iii) a statement that information regarding how the Adviser voted proxies
relating to the Funds during the most recent 12-month period, is available upon
request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting rights, the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

     The Adviser shall maintain the following records relating to proxy-voting
in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than six years from the
end of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on such record, the
first two years on-site:

     -    A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

     -    A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

     -    A copy of each proxy solicitation (including proxy statements) and
          related materials with regard to each vote;

     -    A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution
          of conflicts of interest;

     -    A copy of any document created by the Adviser that was material to a
          proxy -voting decision or that memorialized the basis for that
          decision; and

A copy of each written investor request for information on how the Adviser voted
proxies on behalf of the Fund(s), and a copy of any written response from the
Adviser to any (written or oral) investor request for information on how the
Adviser voted proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                         UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C.
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

The Fund is managed by a portfolio management team, each member of which (each,
a "Portfolio Manager" and together, the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Fund's portfolio. Norman E. Sienko, Jr., the
lead member of the portfolio management team, is primarily responsible for the
selection of the Fund's investments, and is jointly responsible for the
allocation of the Fund's assets among Investment Funds. Russell Sinder, Joseph
M. Sciortino and

<PAGE>

Matthew Woodbury, the other members of the portfolio management team, are
jointly and primarily responsible for the allocation of the Fund's investments.

Mr. Sienko has served as a Portfolio Manager of the Fund since its inception,
and as head of the Adviser's portfolio management group since 1998. He is also
currently an Executive Director of UBS Financial Services. Mr. Sinder has been a
Portfolio Manager of the Fund since 2007. Mr. Sinder has been associated with
the Adviser since 1998 and is also an Executive Director of UBS Financial
Services. Mr. Sciortino joined the portfolio management team in 2007. Mr.
Sciortino has been associated with the Adviser since 2006 and is also a Director
of UBS Financial Services. Previously, he served as Senior Analyst at Lake
Partners, Inc. from April 2001 though August 2006. Mr. Woodbury has been
associated with the Adviser since 2008 and has served as Portfolio Manager
during this time. Mr. Woodbury is a Director of UBS Financial Services.
Previously, he served as an Analyst at Allianz Hedge Fund Partners, LP
(2002-2008) and an Accountant at Arthur Anderson LLP (1999-2002).

The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including registered closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

Potential conflicts of interest may arise because of the Portfolio Managers'
management of the Fund and other accounts. For example, conflicts of interest
may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation of
limited investment opportunities. Allocations of investment opportunities
generally could raise a potential conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio Managers may have an incentive to allocate investments that are
expected to increase in value to preferred accounts. Conversely, a Portfolio
Manager could favor one account over another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem investments are placed. The Portfolio Managers may be
perceived to have a conflict of interest if there are a large number of other
accounts, in addition to the Fund, that they are managing on behalf of the
Adviser. In addition, each Portfolio Manager could be viewed as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more Portfolio Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio Managers' overall responsibilities to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

Other accounts may have investment objectives, strategies and risks that differ
from those of the Fund. For these or other reasons, the Portfolio Managers may
purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts, and the
performance of investments purchased for the Fund may vary from the performance
of the investments purchased for other accounts. The Portfolio Managers may
place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or indirectly
contrary to investment decisions made for the Fund, which could have the
potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

A potential conflict of interest may be perceived if the Adviser receives a
performance-based advisory fee as to one account but not another, because a
Portfolio Manager may favor the account subject to the performance fee, whether
or not the performance of that account directly determines the Portfolio
Manager's compensation.

The Adviser's goal is to provide high quality investment services to all of its
clients, while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients fairly. The
Adviser has adopted and implemented policies and procedures, including brokerage
and trade allocation policies and procedures, that it believes address the
conflicts associated with managing multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition, the Adviser monitors a variety of areas, including compliance with
Fund guidelines. Furthermore, senior investment

<PAGE>

and business personnel at UBS Financial Services periodically review the
performance of the Portfolio Managers.

The Portfolio Managers' compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed salary
and a discretionary bonus paid by UBS Financial Services or its affiliates and
not by the Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid in shares of
stock or stock options of UBS AG, the ultimate parent company of the Adviser,
subject to certain vesting periods. The amount of a Portfolio Manager's
discretionary bonus, and the portion to be paid in shares or stock options of
UBS AG, is determined by senior officers of UBS Financial Services. In general,
the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination of factors, none of which
is necessarily weighted more than any other factor. These factors may include:
the overall performance of UBS Financial Services and its Alternative Investment
Group; the overall performance of UBS AG; the profitability to UBS Financial
Services derived from the management of the Fund and the other accounts managed
by the Alternative Investment Group; the absolute performance of the Fund and
such other accounts for the preceding year; contributions by the Portfolio
Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative Investment Group; participation
by the Portfolio Manager in training of personnel; and support by the Portfolio
Manager generally to colleagues. The bonus is not based on a precise formula,
benchmark or other metric.

The following table lists the number and types of other accounts advised by the
Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management in those
accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.
