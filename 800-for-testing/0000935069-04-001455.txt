geographical regions,  thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in
that region.  Investing in foreign securities  presents certain unique risks not
associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuation and political
and economic  changes and market  risks.  This may result in greater share price
volatility.

LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                   July 28, 2004
   Dear Shareholder,
   So far in 2004, the German equity market has been one of the beneficiaries of
global economic  growth,  which gave a boost to German exports;  exports rose by
more than 4% in the  first  quarter  of 2004.  The  current  global  upswing  is
characterized  by strong demand for capital  goods,  which make up a much larger
share of  German  exports  than  those  of the  country's  surrounding  Euroland
neighbors.  Furthermore,  German  companies have  considerably  increased  their
competitiveness  due to a moderate wage policy and cutbacks in  employment  over
the last few  years.  However,  strong  export  growth has not yet led to higher
employment  and  higher  domestic   demand.   But  large  German  companies  are
increasingly less dependent on the domestic economy. Even classic domestic plays
such as retail and utilities generate an increasing proportion of their revenues
abroad.  Year to date,  the German  economy made modest  progress in its gradual
recovery.  In the second quarter of 2004,  German gross  domestic  product (GDP)
rose 2% on an annualized basis, despite disappointing  domestic growth. In June,
investor  confidence rose for the first time in six months and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its forecast for Germany's economic growth in 2004 to
1.8% from 1.6%.* It also revised its  forecast of  Germany's  GDP to about 2% in
2005.*
   After a weak first  quarter,  the German  markets  held up well in the second
quarter, with the German Mid Cap Market Index increasing in strength relative to
its peers. Unlike in the rest of Europe, where the outperformance of the smaller
caps leveled off in the second  quarter,  the smaller caps in Germany,  at least
those from the classic  sectors,  continued their run. The German Mid Cap Market
Index continued to perform strongly,  significantly  outperforming  German large
caps during the first half of the year.
   For the six months ended June 30, 2004,  the net asset value per share of the
New Germany Fund increased 9.1%, and its share price  increased 9.9%,  while the
fund's benchmark,  the Midcap Market Performance Index,  increased by 8.2% in US
dollar terms during the same period.  Past performance is no guarantee of future
results.  Please see page 2 for the fund's  standardized  performance as of June
30, 2004.
   As in previous quarters, stock selection and company-specific news flow drove
performance of The New Germany Fund.  During the second  quarter,  the fund sold
its  entire  holding in Stada  Arzneimittel  after the  company  issued a profit
warning.  We  reduced  our  overweighted  stance in the  construction  sector by
trimming our  positions in Bilfinger  Berger and  HeidelbergerCement.  Despite a
continuous poor retail environment in the second quarter, the sector contributed
positively to the fund's overall performance because of our long-term holding in
Puma,  which performed  strongly in the first half of 2004. The company released
strong first-quarter results, again beating market expectations. Over the course
of the  quarter,  we  initiated a position in  Suedzucker,  which is the biggest
sugar  producer  in Europe,  and also has the  largest  market  share in Eastern
Europe.  We slightly  increased our  underweight in the machinery and industrial
sector by selling our position in Salzgitter to realize  profits and by reducing
our underweight  position in European Aeronautic  Defense,  which had negatively
affected the fund's performance.  Despite the negative performance  contribution
of our technology stocks,  Suess MicroTec,  IDS Scheer and Kontron, we increased
the fund's  software and technology  sector  weighting by adding to our existing
position  in  United  Internet,  which  contributed  positively  to  the  fund's
performance  in the second  quarter.  Additionally,  we  initiated a position in
Freenet, one of Europe's largest Internet service providers.
   The New Germany  Fund  continued  its  open-market  purchases  of its shares,
buying 1,003,000 shares during the first six months of 2004. The fund's discount
to its net asset value averaged 18.31% during this period.
   At its April 23, 2004 Board Meeting, the Board of Directors elected Sandra M.
Schaufler as new Chief Investment Officer of your Fund. Located in New York, Ms.
Schaufler will be working closely with the Fund's investment  adviser,  Deutsche
Asset  Management  International  GmbH in Frankfurt.  At its July 12, 2004 Board
Meeting, the Board of Directors elected Julian Sluyters as the new President and
Chief Executive Officer of your Fund.

*Source:  IMF June 2004. The IMF is optimistic  that strong external demand will
lead to higher investments and employment and will eventually stimulate domestic
consumption.

(1) Represents the MCAPM Index.
(2)  Represents an arithmetic  composite  consisting of 75% MDAX*/25% NEMAX 50**
     from 1/1/03-3/31/03 and 100% MCAPM*** from 4/1/03-12/31/03. At the February
     3, 2003  Board  Meeting,  the Board of  Directors  approved a change to the
     Fund's benchmark.  Effective April 1, 2003, the Fund's new benchmark became
     the MCAPM (Midcap Market  Performance  Index).  The index is composed of 50
     MDAX and 30 TecDAX****  issues.  The previous  benchmark  (75% MDAX and 25%
     NEMAX  50) is no  longer  viable  long-term  as  the  Deutsche  Boerse  has
     announced plans to discontinue the NEMAX 50.
(3)  Represents 60% MDAX/40% NEMAX 50 for  1/1/02-8/31/02 and 75% MDAX/25% NEMAX
     50 for 9/1/02-12/31/02.
(4)  Represents 60% MDAX/40% NEMAX 50.
(5)  Represents the MDAX Index.
   * MDAX is a total rate of return  index of 50 mid-cap  issues that rank below
     the DAX. DAX is the total rate of return  index of 30 selected  German blue
     chips stocks traded on the Frankfurt stock exchange.
  ** NEMAX 50 is  comprised of the 50 largest  technology  issues from the Prime
     Segment that are ranked below the DAX.
 *** MCAPM is a total  return  index that is composed of various MDAX and TecDAX
     issues,  reflecting the  performance of the mid-caps  across all sectors of
     the Prime Segment.
**** TecDax is a total  return  index that tracks the 30 largest and most liquid
     issues from the various technology sectors of the Prime Segment beneath the
     DAX.
Index returns  assume  reinvested  dividends  and,  unlike Fund returns,  do not
reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.


Investments in funds involve risk including the loss of principal.

This Fund is not diversified and focuses its investments in certain geographical
regions,  thereby  increasing its  vulnerability to developments in that region.
Investing in foreign  securities  presents  certain  unique risks not associated
with  domestic  investments,  such as currency  fluctuation  and  political  and
economic  changes  and market  risks.  This may result in  greater  share  price
volatility.

Shares of closed-end  funds  frequently  trade at a discount to net asset value.
The price of the Fund's shares is determined by a number of factors,  several of
which are beyond the control of the Fund.  Therefore,  the Fund  cannot  predict
whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   QUESTION:   In  2002,   the  capital   gains  tax   exemption  for  corporate
shareholdings  went into effect,  but it has gained  momentum only over the last
year.  Will you give us an update on the recent  restructuring  activity and its
impact on the German equity market?

   ANSWER: The capital gains tax exemption for corporate  shareholdings proposed
in December 1999, approved in July 2000, and effective since 1 January 2002, was
expected  to   significantly   reduce   corporate   shareholdings   in  Germany.
Unfortunately, the decline in equity markets until early 2003 resulted in little
demand for any placements of shares on the equity market.  The depressed  market
also significantly reduced unrealized capital gains and thereby the incentive to
sell. The disposal process therefore proceeded slowly until mid-2003.  Following
the start of the equity  market  rebound in March 2003,  investors  first had to
digest  several  rights issues aimed at  balance-sheet  repair.  As share prices
rose,  the readiness of stake owners to sell their holdings also  increased.  In
late 2003 and early 2004,  with the equity market more  positive,  there finally
was scope for the placement of corporate  stakes.  The latest example is that of
RWE disposing of its stakes in Hochtief and HeidelbergCement.  Among financials,
the  disentanglement  of  the  closely  meshed  web of  corporate  shareholdings
continued.   German   corporations   have  made  progress  in  unwinding   cross
shareholdings over the past three to four years.

   QUESTION:  Germany has shown strong export growth figures during the last few
quarters.  However,  this rise did not  translate  into higher  employment  or a
strengthening of domestic demand. Is strong export growth less of a stimulus for
the domestic economy than it was in earlier cycles?

   ANSWER:  Germany was the largest  exporter  worldwide in 2003 (in USD terms),
followed by the United  States,  Japan and China.  While much of the increase is
due to the euro  appreciation,  it shows as well that German  companies can hold
their own in international competition.  In contrast to earlier cycles, however,
strong export growth has not yet led to higher  employment  and higher  domestic
demand. This raises the question of whether the lack of the traditional positive
spillover  effect of  increased  exports  (then  boosting the economy) is due to
permanent  structural  changes or whether it is a temporary  phenomenon.  German
products' strong  competitiveness  abroad is at least in part due to outsourcing
abroad.  Since 2000,  direct  investment worth 114 billion euro has gone abroad.
The proportion  destined for Central and Eastern Europe rose to more than 20% in
2003.  This means that part of the German  value-creation  chain was  outsourced
abroad  in order to  maintain  and  increase  international  competitiveness  by
cutting labor costs.

   QUESTION:  At the beginning of July, two events took place that were intended
to positively influence the German economy but angered German labor unions. Will
you discuss these developments?

   ANSWER:  First, at the beginning of July, Germany's upper house of parliament
passed a law  reducing  long-term  jobless  benefits,  which will take effect in
January  2005.  This marks the first  reduction in benefits  since World War II,
saving the  government  an estimated  2.5 billion  euro per year.  Under the new
rules for long-term employment benefits,  claimants will have to draw on private
wealth,  retirement  savings  and  property  owned by a spouse  before  becoming
eligible for state  benefits.  With more than 2.5 million  long-term  unemployed
people currently in Germany, the government's welfare rolls have become bloated.
According to the German  Economics and Labor minister,  Wolfgang  Clement,  this
reform will help to move  jobless  people  more  efficiently  and  swiftly  into
employment. Second, Siemens and IG Metall, the metalworkers' trade union, agreed
recently to  reintroduce  the  40-hour  work week (from 35 hours) in two Siemens
plants without extra pay. Industry media suggests that if this agreement had not
been reached, Siemens would probably have moved many of the jobs to Hungary. The
longer work hours at Siemens are  actually  equivalent  to a 12.5% cut in hourly
wages  for the  employees,  which  shows the  extent to which the trade  unions'
negotiating  power has eroded.  Trade unions lack the means to prevent companies
from moving jobs abroad,  and fears of unemployment have weakened union members'
willingness  to fight.  German  companies  are  trying to slash  labor  costs or
increase   output  per  employee  in  order  to  weather  strong   international
competition.  Overall, the longer working hours without extra pay as well as the
reduction in welfare benefits are a favorable development for Germany.

Sandra M. Schaufler, Chief Investment Officer of the New Germany Fund.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
   Thus far in 2004,  the German  economy  made  modest  progress in its gradual
recovery.  Second quarter real gross domestic  product,  or GDP,  expanded at an
annualized  rate of 2%. This was the strongest rate of growth in three years and
was  exclusively  driven by net exports.  As world trade picked up  considerably
over the last few quarters,  demand for German exports increased. In particular,
the share of German  exports to Eastern  Europe  amounted to almost 14% of total
exports--a  significant  component  of  global  demand.   Additionally,   strong
worldwide demand for capital goods also benefited  German exports.  According to
countless  industry studies referenced  recently in the media,  German companies
significantly  increased their imports of intermediate goods used for exports in
order to keep a lid on wage costs.  Thus,  the link between  German  exports and
domestic demand has become weaker than in previous years.

   The fiscal situation looks set to remain  difficult.  In fact, in our opinion
the German  budget  deficit is likely to stay above 3% of GDP both this year and
next, so Germany could violate the Stability and Growth Pact for the fourth year
in a row in 2005. While the structural deficit will probably be reduced,  in our
view, the growth environment could remain too weak for a significant increase in
tax revenues. As a result, the government might have to cut subsidies further to
rescue the budget deficit in the next few years, as Germany has agreed to reduce
its  deficit to below 3% of GDP by 2005 at the  latest.  High oil prices and the
increase in indirect taxes led to a pronounced  acceleration in German inflation
in the last few months to 1.8%. However,  the domestically driven price trend is
still subdued.  In 2005, the significant output gap, moderate wage increases and
a strong euro could, in our opinion,  lead to a reduction in the German Consumer
price Index . After  having toyed with the idea of lowering  rates  earlier this
year, the European  Central Bank is now taking a strictly  neutral stance due to
the clearer signs that recovery is under way.

THE NEW GERMANY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--JUNE 30, 2004 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The New Germany Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated in Maryland on January
16, 1990 as a non-diversified,  closed-end  management  investment company.  The
Fund commenced investment operations on January 30, 1990.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors  of the Fund.  The Fund  calculates  its net asset  value per share at
11:30 A.M.,  New York time,  in order to minimize  the  possibility  that events
occurring  after  the close of the  securities  exchanges  on which  the  Fund's
portfolio  securities  principally trade would require adjustment to the closing
market prices in order to reflect fair value.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION:  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and liabilities  denominated in euros and other foreign  currency amounts
are  translated  into United States  dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the
buying and selling  spot rates  quoted by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.
Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income and expenses are reported
at the rate of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.
The  resultant  gains and losses  arising from exchange  rate  fluctuations  are
identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,  except for such amounts
attributable  to  investments  which are included in net realized and unrealized
gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.

CONTINGENCIES:  In the  normal  course  of  business,  the Fund may  enter  into
contracts  that  contain a variety  of  representations  which  provide  general
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown as this would  involve  future  claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred.  However, based on experience,  the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code applicable to regulated  investment  companies and to distribute all of its
taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

At  December  31,  2003,  the  Fund's   components  of  distributable   earnings
(accumulated  losses) on a  tax-basis  were as follows:

Undistributed  ordinary income* ...............    $ 1,210,857
Capital loss  carryforward ....................  $(196,226,000)
Net  unrealized appreciation ..................  $  74,657,745

*For tax  purposes  short-term  capital  gains  are considered ordinary income.

During the year ended  December 31, 2003, the Fund  reclassified  permanent book
and tax differences as follows:

                                                  INCREASE
                                                 (DECREASE)
                                                 ----------
Undistributed net investment income ........... $ 152,983
Undistributed net realized gain on investments
  and foreign currency transactions ...........  (152,983)

           ADVISORY AGREEMENTS
The  Fund  has  a  Management   Agreement   with  and  related   undertaking  by
(collectively,  the "Management  Agreement")  Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (the
"Manager"),  and an Investment Advisory Agreement with Deutsche Asset Management
International  GmbH (the "Investment  Adviser").  The Manager and the Investment
Adviser are affiliated companies.

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and
payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .65% of the Fund's  average weekly net
assets up to $100 million,  .55% of such assets in excess of $100 million and up
to $500  million,  and  .50% of such  assets  in  excess  of $500  million.  The
Investment  Advisory  Agreement  provides  the  Investment  Adviser  with a fee,
computed weekly and payable  monthly,  at the annual rates of .35% of the Fund's
average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100  million.  Accordingly,  for the  period  ended June 30,  2004,  the fee
pursuant to the Management and Investment  Advisory Agreements was equivalent to
an annualized effective rate of .89% of the Fund's average net assets.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser, in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objectives,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale
orders and  selects  brokers and dealers to execute  portfolio  transactions  on
behalf of the Fund.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
For the period ended June 30, 2004,  Deutsche  Bank AG, the German parent of the
Manager and Investment Adviser, and its affiliates received $33,449 in brokerage
commissions as a result of executing agency transactions in portfolio securities
on behalf of the Fund,  that the board  determined  were  effected in compliance
with the Fund's Rule 17e-1 procedures.

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers of either the Manager or Deutsche
Bank AG.

The Fund pays each Director not affiliated  with the Manager  retainer fees plus
specified amounts for attended board and committee meetings.

NOTE 4. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES
Purchases and sales of investment securities, other than short-term investments,
for  the  period  ended  June  30,  2004,  were   $71,179,149  and  $78,452,425,
respectively.

The cost of investments at December 31, 2003 was  $154,899,016 for United States
Federal  income  tax  purposes.  Accordingly,  as  of  December  31,  2003,  net
unrealized  appreciation  of  investments  aggregated   $74,657,745,   of  which
$76,675,581 and $2,017,836 related to unrealized  appreciation and depreciation,
respectively.

For United States Federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry
forward  at  December  31,  2003  of   approximately   $196,226,000,   of  which
$107,987,000  and  $88,239,000  will expire in 2009 and 2010,  respectively.  No
capital gains  distribution is expected to be paid to shareholders  until future
net gains have been  realized in excess of such carry  forward.

NOTE 5. CAPITAL
During the period ended June 30, 2004 and the year ended  December 31, 2003, the
Fund purchased 1,003,000 and 1,079,300 of its shares of common stock on the open
market at a total cost of $7,718,153 and $6,196,319,  respectively. The weighted

the  Fund  reissued  81,662  shares  held in  treasury  as part of the  dividend
reinvestment plan.

++   Total investment  return based on market value is calculated  assuming that
     shares of the Fund's  common  stock were  purchased  at the closing  market
     price as of the beginning of the year,  dividends,  capital gains and other
     distributions  were  reinvested  as  provided  for in the  Fund's  dividend
     reinvestment  plan and then sold at the closing  market  price per share on
     the last day of the  year.  The  computation  does not  reflect  any  sales
     commission investors may incur in purchasing or selling shares of the Fund.
     The  total  investment  return  based on the net asset  value is  similarly
     computed  except  that the Fund's net asset  value is  substituted  for the
     closing market value.
*    The  custody  credits are  attributable  to  interest  earned on U.S.  cash
     balances.  The ratio of total expenses after custody credits to average net
     assets are 1.19%,  1.39%,  1.47%,  1.25%,  1.08% and 1.07% for 2004,  2003,
     2002, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
**   Annualized.
***  Not Annualized.
**** Not  Annualized.  The ratio for six months ended June 30, 2004 has not been
     annualized since the Fund believes it would not be appropriate  because the
     Fund's dividend income is not earned ratably throughout the fiscal year.

                         AND DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund offers  stockholders  a Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program and Dividend
Reinvestment  Plan ("Plan")  which  provides for optional cash purchases and for
the automatic reinvestment of dividends and distributions payable by the Fund in
additional Fund shares.  Plan  participants  may invest as little as $100 in any
month and may invest up to $36,000 annually.  The Plan has been amended to allow
current  shareholders,  who are not already  participants in the Plan, and first
time  investors  to enroll in the Plan by making an initial  cash  deposit of at
least  $250 with the plan  agent.  Share  purchases  are  combined  to receive a
beneficial  brokerage fee. A brochure is available by writing or telephoning the
plan agent:

as it considers and evaluates candidates recommended by other sources.

                     controls and procedures and presented in this report our
                     conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure

                     to the filing date of this report based on such evaluation;

                 (d) Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
                     internal control over financial reporting that occurred
                     during the registrant's most recent fiscal half-year (the
                     registrant's second fiscal half-year in the case of an
                     annual report) that has materially affected, or is
                     reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
                     internal control over financial reporting; and

5.            The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed
              to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
              registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
              equivalent functions):

                 (a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
                     design or operation of internal control over financial
                     reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
                     the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize, and
                     report financial information; and

                 (b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
                     management or other employees who have a significant role
                     in the registrant's internal control over financial
                     reporting.
