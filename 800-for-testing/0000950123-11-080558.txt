1.   ORGANIZATION

     O'Connor Fund of Funds: Long/Short Strategies LLC (formerly
     UBS M2 Fund, L.L.C.) (the "Fund") was organized as a limited liability
     company under the laws of Delaware on August 13, 2001 and commenced
     operations on February 1, 2003. The Fund is registered under the Investment
     Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,
     non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund's investment
     objective is to seek capital appreciation over the long-term. The Fund is a
     multi-manager fund that seeks to achieve its objective by deploying its
     assets among a select group of portfolio managers who primarily employ
     long/short equity strategies, including those involving foreign issuers.
     Generally, such portfolio managers conduct their investment programs
     through unregistered investment funds (collectively, the "Investment
     Funds"), in which the Fund invests as a limited partner, member or
     shareholder along with other investors.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") have overall responsibility
     to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund, including the
     exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies regarding the
     management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.

     The Directors have engaged UBS Alternative and Quantitative Investments LLC
     ("UBS A&Q", the "Adviser" and, when providing services under the
     Administration Agreement, the "Administrator"), a Delaware limited
     liability company, to provide investment advice regarding the selection of
     Investment Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the
     Fund. The Adviser is a wholly owned subsidiary of UBS AG and is registered
     as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
     amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Directors may determine and are generally
     accepted monthly. The Directors reserve the right to reject any application
     for interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase interests pursuant to
     written tenders to Members. These repurchases will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their complete
     and exclusive discretion. Members can only transfer or assign their
     membership interests or a portion thereof (i) by operation of law pursuant
     to the death, bankruptcy, insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii)
     with the written approval of the Directors, which may be withheld in their
     sole and absolute discretion. Such transfers may be made even if the
     balance of the capital account to such transferee is equal to or less than
     the transferor's initial capital contribution.

2.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     Codification Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, Fair Value
     Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value
     Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs ("ASU
     2011-04"). ASU 2011-04 requires disclosure of all transfers between Level 1
     and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those
     transfers. In addition, ASU 2011-04 expands the qualitative and
     quantitative fair value disclosure requirements for fair value measurements
     categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires a
     description of the valuation processes in place and a description of the
     sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and
     interrelationships between those inputs if a change in those inputs would
     result in a significantly different fair value measurement. ASU 2011-04 is
     effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and for
     interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of the ASU 2011-04
     is currently being assessed but is not expected to have a material impact
     on the Fund's financial statements.

3.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     The Fund values its investments at fair value, in accordance with U.S.
     generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which is the price that
     would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an
     orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

     Various inputs are used in determining the fair value of the Fund's
     investments which are summarized in the three broad levels listed below.

     LEVEL 1-- quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     LEVEL 2-- fair value of investments in Investment Funds with the ability to
     redeem at net asset value as of the measurement date, or within one year of
     the measurement date

     LEVEL 3-- fair value of investments in Investment Funds that do not have
     the ability to redeem at net asset value within one year of the measurement
     date

     The Fund recognizes transfers into and out of the levels indicated
     above at the end of the reporting period. All transfers into and out of
     Level 3 can be found in the Level 3 reconciliation table within the
     Schedule of Portfolio Investments.

     GAAP provides guidance in determining whether there has been a significant
     decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability when
     compared with normal market activity for such asset or liability (or
     similar assets or liabilities). GAAP also provides guidance on identifying

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2011

3.   SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED)

     A. PORTFOLIO  VALUATION  (CONTINUED)

     circumstances that indicate a transaction with regards to such an asset or
     liability is not orderly. In its consideration, the Fund must consider
     inputs and valuation techniques used for each class of assets and
     liabilities. Judgment is used to determine the appropriate classes of
     assets and liabilities for which disclosures about fair value
     measurements are provided. Fair value measurement disclosures for each
     class of assets and liabilities requires greater disaggregation than
     the Fund's line items in the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and
     Members' Capital. The Fund determines the appropriate classes for
     those disclosures on the basis of the nature and risks of the assets
     and liabilities and their classification in the fair value hierarchy
     (i.e., Levels 1, 2, and 3).

     For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis
     during the period, the Fund provides quantitative disclosures about
     the fair value measurements separately for each class of assets and
     liabilities, as well as a reconciliation of beginning and ending
     balances of Level 3 assets and liabilities broken down by class.

     The following is a summary of the investment strategies and any
     restrictions on the liquidity provisions of the investments in
     Investment Funds held in the Fund as of June 30, 2011. Investment
     Funds with no current redemption restrictions may be subject to future
     gates, lock-up provisions or other restrictions, in accordance with
     their offering documents. The Fund had no unfunded capital commitments
     as of June 30, 2011. Effective June 30, 2011, the Fund used the
     following categories to classify its Investment Funds.

     The Investment Funds in the equity hedged strategy generally utilize
     fundamental analysis to invest in publicly traded equities investing
     in both long and short positions seeking to capture perceived security
     mispricings. Portfolio construction is driven primarily by bottom-up
     fundamental research; top-down analysis may also be applied.
     Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 30 -
     125 day redemption notice periods. Investment Funds representing
     approximately 3 percent of the fair value of the investments in this
     strategy are side pockets or liquidating trusts where the liquidation
     of assets is expected over the next 36 months. The remaining
     approximately 97 percent of the Investment Funds are available to be
     redeemed with no restrictions, as of the measurement date.

     The Investment Funds in the trading strategy are generally top-down in
     nature and often driven by econometric and macroeconomic research.
     These strategies may utilize financial instruments, such as foreign
     exchange, equities, rates, sovereign debt, currencies, and commodities
     to express a manager's view. In executing different approaches,
     managers may use either fundamental or

     A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     quantitative models or a combination of both. Investment Funds within this
     strategy are generally subject to 60 - 90 day redemption notice
     periods and are available to be redeemed with no restrictions, as of
     the measurement date.

     A detailed depiction of each investment in the portfolio by investment
     strategy, including any additional liquidity terms and other
     restrictions, as well as a breakdown of the portfolio into the fair
     value measurement levels, can be found in the tables within the
     Schedule of Portfolio Investments.

     Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
     Adviser as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal period in
     accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be
     determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the
     Directors. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are subject to
     the terms and conditions of the respective operating agreements and
     offering memorandums, as appropriate. The Fund's investments in
     Investment Funds are carried at fair value. All valuations utilize
     financial information supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of
     management and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to
     the Investment Funds' managers or pursuant to the Investment Funds'
     agreements. The Fund's valuation procedures require the Adviser to
     consider all relevant information available at the time the Fund
     values its portfolio. The Adviser has assessed factors including, but
     not limited to the individual Investment Funds' compliance with fair
     value measurements, price transparency and valuation procedures in
     place, and subscription and redemption activity. The Adviser and/or
     the Directors will consider such information and consider whether it
     is appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances, to value such
     a position at its net asset value as reported or whether to adjust
     such value. The underlying investments of each Investment Fund are
     accounted for at fair value as described in each Investment Fund's
     financial statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments).

     The fair value relating to certain underlying investments of these
     Investment Funds, for which there is no ready market, has been
     estimated by the respective Investment Funds' management and is based
     upon available information in the absence of readily ascertainable
     fair values and does not necessarily represent amounts that might
     ultimately be realized. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuation,
     those estimated fair values may differ significantly from the values
     that would have been used had a ready market for the investments
     existed. These differences could be material.

     It is unknown on an aggregate basis whether the Investment Funds held
     any investments whereby the Fund's proportionate share exceeded 5% of
     the Fund's net assets at June 30, 2011. The fair value of the Fund's
     assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments
     approximates the carrying amounts presented in the Statement of
     Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

3.   SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  (CONTINUED)

     B. INVESTMENT  TRANSACTIONS  AND  INCOME  RECOGNITION

        The Fund accounts for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund
        transactions based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of
        the underlying investment at the date of redemption. Interest income
        and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.

     C. FUND  EXPENSES

     The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business, including, but not
     limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees;
     accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the
     Fund's net asset value; costs of insurance; registration expenses;
     interest expense; offering and organization costs; due diligence,
     including travel and related expenses; expenses of meetings of
     Directors; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and
     other types of expenses approved by the Directors.

     D. INCOME  TAXES

     The Fund  has reclassified $5,324,362 and $37,622,909 from accumulated net
     investment  loss and accumulated net realized gain from investments in
     Investment  Funds,  respectively,  to net capital contributions during
     the  six month period ended June 30, 2011. The reclassification was to
     reflect,  as  an  adjustment  to  net  contributions,  the  amount  of
     estimated  taxable  income  or  loss  that  have been allocated to the
     Fund's  Members  as  of  June  30,  2011 and had no effect on members'
     capital.

     The Fund files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and
     applicable states. Management has analyzed the Fund's tax positions
     taken on its federal and state income tax returns for all open tax
     years, and has concluded that no provision for federal or state income
     tax is required in the Fund's financial statements. The Fund's federal
     and state income tax returns for tax years for which the applicable
     statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to examination by
     the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of revenue. The
     Fund recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to
     unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of
     Operations. For the six month period ended June 30, 2011, the Fund did
     not incur any interest or penalties.

     Each Member is individually required to report on its own tax return its
     distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

   E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

   Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies held in custodial accounts.
   The Fund has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not
   believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.

   F. USE OF ESTIMATES

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
   management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
   amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
   liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
   amounts of increases and decreases in members' capital from operations
   during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
   estimates.

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

   The Adviser provides investment advisory services to the Fund pursuant to
   an Investment Management Agreement. Pursuant to that agreement, the
   Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee (the "Investment Management Fee")
   at the annual rate of 1.45% of the Fund's members' capital, excluding
   the capital account attributable to the Adviser.

   The Administrator provides certain administrative services to the Fund,
   including, among other things, providing office space and other support
   services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays the
   Administrator a monthly fee (the "Management Fee") at an annual rate of
   0.30% of the Fund's members' capital, excluding the capital account
   attributable to the Adviser. The Management Fee and the Investment
   Management Fee will be paid to the Adviser out of the Fund's assets and
   debited against the Members' capital accounts, excluding the capital
   account attributable to the Adviser. A portion of the Investment Management
   Fee and the Management Fee is paid by UBS A&Q to its affiliates.

   UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS
   Americas, Inc., acts as a placement agent for the Fund, without
   special compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated
   with its activities as placement agent. Placement fees, if any,
   charged on contributions are debited against the contribution amounts,
   to arrive at a net subscription amount. The placement fee does not
   constitute assets of the Fund.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     The  net increase or decrease in members' capital derived from operations
     (net income or loss) is allocated to the capital accounts of all
     Members on a pro-rata basis, other than the Investment Management Fee
     and the Management Fee which are similarly allocated to all Members
     other than the Adviser or Administrator as described above.

     Each Director of the Fund receives an annual retainer of $8,250 plus a fee
     for each meeting attended. The Chairman of the Board of Directors and
     the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors each
     receive an additional annual retainer in the amount of $20,000. These
     additional annual retainer amounts are paid for by the Fund on a
     pro-rata basis with ten other UBS funds where UBS A&Q is the
     investment adviser. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for all
     reasonable out of pocket expenses.

     Other investment partnerships sponsored by UBS AG or its affiliates may
     also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by
     the Fund.

5.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODY FEES

     PFPC Trust Company (the "Custodian"), which was renamed BNY Mellon
     Investment Servicing Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, provides
     custodial services for the Fund. The Custodian entered into a service
     agreement whereby The Bank of New York Mellon provides securities
     clearance functions, as needed.

     BNY  Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNY Mellon") serves as
     accounting and investor servicing agent to the Fund and in that
     capacity provides certain administrative, accounting, record keeping,
     tax and Member related services. BNY Mellon receives a monthly fee
     primarily based upon (i) the average members' capital of the Fund
     subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii) the aggregate members'
     capital of the Fund and certain other investment funds sponsored or
     advised by UBS AG, UBS Americas, Inc. or their affiliates.
     Additionally, the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses
     incurred by BNY Mellon.

     Effective March 26, 2010, the Custodian and BNY Mellon have agreed to a fee
     reduction for reimbursement of the Fund's line of credit commitment fees
     ("Fee Reduction") for a period of 364 days from November 1, 2010, the
     effective date of the Fund's line of credit agreement with State Street
     Bank and Trust Company ("Initial Term"). Based on the methodology within
     the agreement, the Custodian and BNY Mellon have agreed to waive $81,700
     for the Fund over the Initial Term. For the six month period ended June 30,
     2011, the Custodian and BNY Mellon waived $3,600 and $37,250, respectively,
     which is shown in aggregate as administration and custody fees waived on
     the Statement of Operations.

6.   LOAN PAYABLE

     Effective November 1, 2010, the Fund, along with other UBS
     sponsored funds, entered into a one year, $250,000,000 committed, secured
     revolving line of credit with State Street Bank and Trust Company. The Fund
     is limited to $81,700,000 (the "Borrower Sublimit Amount") of the secured
     revolving line of credit with a maximum borrowing limit of 15% of the
     Fund's Members' Capital. The interest rate on the borrowing is the higher
     of (a) 1.50% above the Overnight LIBOR Rate and (b) 1.50% above the Federal
     Funds Rate, in each case as in effect from time to time. There is a
     commitment fee payable by the Fund, calculated at 25 basis points per annum
     of the Borrower Sublimit Amount not utilized.

     For  the six month period ended June 30, 2011, the Fund's average interest
     rate paid on borrowings was 1.65% per annum and the average borrowings
     outstanding was $4,635,359. The Fund had no borrowings outstanding at
     June 30, 2011. Interest expense for the six month period ended June
     30, 2011 was $38,241 of which $23,415 was payable at June 30, 2011.

7.   INVESTMENTS

     As of June 30, 2011, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds, none of
     which were related parties.

     Aggregate purchases and proceeds from sales of investments for the six
     month period ended June 30, 2011 amounted to $110,529,851 and $213,477,786,
     respectively.

     The  cost of investments for federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
     items of taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Investment
     Funds. The allocated taxable income is reported to the Fund by the
     Investment Funds on Schedule K-1. The tax basis of investments for
     2011 will not be finalized by the Fund until after the fiscal year
     end.

     The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for
     compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management
     fees of 1.00% to 2.00% (per annum) of net assets and performance incentive
     fees and allocations ranging from 16.50% to 30.00% of net profits earned.
     One or more underlying fund investments have entered into a side pocket
     arrangement. Detailed information about the Investment Funds' portfolios is
     not available.

8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund
     invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
     investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
     not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
     contracts for differences, and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in
     these Investment Funds is limited to the fair value of these investments.

9.   INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the execution of these provisions against the Fund.
     Based on its history and experience, the Fund believes that the likelihood
     of such an event is remote.

10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     As of June 30, 2011, the Fund had $88,598,596 of withdrawals payable. On
     July 21, 2011, the Fund paid $80,516,069. The remaining amount payable
