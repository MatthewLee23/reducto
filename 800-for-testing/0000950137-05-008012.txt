ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of
common shares outstanding. The common share market price is the price the market
is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time. Common share market
price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply and demand and
market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the beginning of the
period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in accordance with the
trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares at the end of the
period.

The Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based statistical
composite of New York municipal bonds. The index does not include any expenses,
fees or sales charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and
should not be considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in
an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE 6-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2005

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals is managed by the
Adviser's Municipal Fixed Income team.(1) Current members include Dennis
Pietrzak and John Reynoldson, Executive Directors of the Adviser; and Robert
Wimmel, Vice President of the Adviser.

MARKET CONDITIONS

The six-month period ended April 30, 2005, was characterized by continued
short-term interest rate increases. As crude oil prices reached record highs,
the prospect of rising inflation also cast a shadow. The Federal Open Market
Committee (the "Fed") raised the federal funds target rate 100 basis points
during the period through a series of four "measured" 0.25 percent tightenings
to 2.75 percent by the end of April. Although rates in the short and
intermediate areas of the yield curve shifted upward as the Fed tightened, long-
term interest rates fell as buyers did not seem deterred by the prospect of
rising inflation. As a result, the yield curve (the difference between short and
longer-term yields) flattened and the long end of the municipal market handily
outperformed the shorter end.

The municipal market in total posted positive returns during the period, though
it was not uniformly strong. In contrast to the strong showing by longer-term
bonds, shorter-term municipals were hampered by the Fed's tightening and turned
in a flat to slightly negative showing. Within the investment-grade segment of
the market, yield differentials between BBB-rated and AAA-rated municipal
securities were slightly wider, though BBB-rated securities still outperformed
high grades due to their higher coupons, while securities rated below investment
grade strongly outperformed as investors sought out their higher yields.

The Fed's interest rate hikes did not appear to dampen investors' appetites for
municipal bonds, as net inflows into municipal bond funds topped $290 million
during the period. The supply of new issues was modest during the closing months
of 2004 (the first two months of the period) before soaring in the opening
months of 2005 as long-term issuers rushed to bring securities to market in
anticipation of additional interest rate increases in the near term.

New York continued to be one of the most active markets in the nation for new
issuance during the period, although economic conditions were not uniformly
strong. New York's economy continued to improve, and its credit rating was
upgraded due in large part to a guardedly optimistic outlook for New York City's
fiscal health. The city continued to issue Liberty bonds to fund reconstruction
efforts at the site of the World Trade Center. In contrast, the northern part of
the state continued to struggle economically.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities, by the total number of common shares outstanding, while market
price reflects the supply and demand for the shares. As a result, the two
returns can differ, as they did during the reporting period. On an NAV basis,
the trust outperformed its benchmark index, the Lehman Brothers New York
Municipal Bond Index. On a market price basis, the trust underperformed its
benchmark.

AND INDEX DEFINITION.

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage
of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. The Fed's policy of
raising interest rates throughout the period made the trust's borrowing activity
more expensive. These expenses, however, were more than offset by the positive
performance of the bonds held by the trust.

One of our key strategies in managing the trust during the period was to
position it for rising interest rates. This approach was largely the result of
our analysis of interest rates, which remained relatively low by historical
standards even after rising from their multi-decade lows earlier. We effected
this positioning in two ways. First, we kept the trust's duration (a measure of
interest-rate sensitivity) below that of its benchmark. Second, to limit the
trust's exposure to areas of the market that would be most likely susceptible to
rising rates, we also trimmed the trust's shorter-maturity bonds. We reinvested
the proceeds from those sales into bonds with premium coupons and maturities
between 25 and 30 years. In addition to offering relatively attractive income
streams, these securities positioned the trust to benefit from any future
flattening of the yield curve.

We kept the trust's exposure well diversified across the major sectors of the
New York municipal market. Much of our relative-value trading activity was
focused on selling issues that had been pre-refunded and purchasing what we
believed to be more attractive securities in sectors such as health care and
public

                                                                               3

education. The trust remained focused on investment-grade securities, with 100
percent of the portfolio rated BBB or higher at the end of the period.

There is no guarantee the security sectors mentioned will continue to perform
well or be held by the trust in the future.

(a)As required, effective November 1, 2001, the Trust has adopted the provisions
   of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began
   accreting market discount on fixed income securities. The effect of this
   change for the period ended October 31, 2002 was to increase net investment
   income per share by $.01, decrease net realized and unrealized gains and
   losses per share by $.01 and increase the ratio of net investment income to
   average net assets applicable to common shares by .05%. Per share, ratios and
   supplemental data for periods prior to October 31, 2002 have not been
   restated to reflect this change in presentation.

(b)Total return assumes an investment at the common share market price at the
   beginning of the period indicated, reinvestment of all distributions for the
   period in accordance with the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of
   all shares at the closing common share market price at the end of the period
   indicated.

(c)Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred
   shareholders.

(d)Ratios reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders.

(e)Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the
   preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets and dividing this by the
   number of preferred shares outstanding.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust") is
registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to provide a high level of current income exempt from
federal as well as New York State and New York City income taxes, consistent
with preservation of capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its
assets in New York municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of
investment, but may invest up to 20% of its assets in unrated securities which
are believed to be of comparable quality to those rated investment grade. The
Trust commenced investment operations on March 27, 1992.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At April 30, 2005, the Trust had $3,134,990 of when-issued and
delayed delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") will provide investment advice and facilities to the
Trust for an annual fee payable monthly of .55% of the average daily net assets
of the Trust. Effective November 1, 2004, the investment advisory fee was
reduced from .60% to .55%.

    For the six months ended April 30, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $4,700 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

    Under separate Accounting Services and Legal Services agreements, the
Adviser provides accounting and legal services to the Trust. The Adviser
allocates the cost of such services to each trust. For the six months ended
April 30, 2005, the Trust recognized expenses of approximately $16,300
representing Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its affiliates' (collectively "Van
Kampen") cost of providing accounting and legal services to the Trust, which are
reported as part of "Other" and "Legal" expenses, respectively, in the Statement
of Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

                                                                              17

trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

3. CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $39,024,110 and $42,328,822,
respectively.

5. PREFERRED SHARES

As of April 30, 2005, the Trust has outstanding 2,400 Auction Preferred Shares
("APS"). Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rate is generally reset every
28 days through an auction process. The rate in effect on April 30, 2005 was
2.400%. During the six months ended April 30, 2005, the rates ranged from 1.400%
to 2.400%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense in the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

6. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

7. TRUST MERGER

On May 11, 2005, the Trustees of New York Quality Municipal Trust and New York
Value Municipal Income Trust ("Target Trusts") announced its intention to merge
the Target Trusts into Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals
("Acquiring Trust"). The Trustees of each of the trusts have approved in
principal an agreement and plan of reorganization between the trusts providing
for a transfer of assets and liabilities of the Target Trusts to the Acquiring
Trust in exchange for shares of beneficial interest of the Acquiring Trust (the

"Reorganization"). The Reorganization is subject to the approval by the
shareholders of the Target Trusts.

8. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Trust may invest up to 15% of its net assets in "inverse floating rate
obligations." The inverse floating rate obligations in which the Trust may
invest are typically created through a division of a fixed-rate municipal
obligation into two separate instruments, a short-term obligation and a
long-term obligation. The interest rate on the short-term obligation is set at
periodic auctions. The interest rate on the long-term obligation which the Trust
may purchase is the rate the issuer would have paid on the fixed-income
obligation, (i) plus the difference between such fixed rate and the rate on the
short-term obligation, if the short-term rate is lower than the fixed rate: or
(ii) minus such difference if the interest rate on the short-term obligation is
higher than the fixed rate. These securities have varying degrees of liquidity
and the market value of such securities generally will fluctuate in response to
changes in market rates of interest to a greater extent than the value of an
equal principal amount of a fixed rate security having similar credit quality,
redemption provisions and maturity. These securities tend to underperform the
market for fixed rate bonds in a rising interest rate environment, but tend to
outperform the market for fixed rate bonds when interest rates decline or remain
relatively stable. Although volatile, inverse floating rate obligations
typically offer the potential for yields exceeding the yields available on fixed
rate bonds with comparable credit quality, coupon, call provisions and maturity.
These securities usually permit the investor to convert the floating rate
security counterpart to a fixed rate (normally adjusted downward), and this
optional conversion feature may provide a partial hedge against rising rates if
exercised at an opportune time.

                                                                              19
