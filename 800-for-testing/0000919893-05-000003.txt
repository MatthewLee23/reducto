Franklin Templeton Investments

GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE


Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the specialized
expertise of three world-class investment management groups--Franklin, Templeton
and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE

Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying on its
own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines that underlie
its success.

FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized leader in fixed income
investing and also brings expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
investing.

TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing and, in
1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today, with
research offices in over 25 countries, they offer investors the broadest global
reach in the industry.

MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style of
value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among undervalued
stocks, arbitrage situations and distressed companies.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION

Because our management groups work independently and adhere to distinctly
different investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
typically have a low overlap of securities. That's why our funds can be used to
build truly diversified portfolios covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST

At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the
reliable account services that have helped us become one of the most trusted
names in financial services.

Important Notice to Shareholders


REPURCHASE PROGRAM

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program, which was
originally implemented in October 1997. The Fund's Board of Directors had
discontinued the open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection
with the Fund's previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund
may purchase, from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in
open-market transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.

Annual Report

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

YOUR FUND'S GOAL AND MAIN INVESTMENTS: Templeton Dragon Fund seeks long-term
capital appreciation by investing at least 45% of its total assets in equity
securities of "China companies," as defined in the Fund's prospectus.




Dear Shareholder:

This annual report for Templeton Dragon Fund covers the year ended December 31,
2004.


PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the year ended December 31, 2004, Templeton Dragon Fund posted cumulative
total returns of +0.36% in market price terms and +16.22% in net asset value
terms, as the Fund's market price declined more than the Fund's net asset value.
You can find the Fund's long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on
page 7.


ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Recognizing China's growing importance in the global economy, Asian, Latin
American and European nations signed numerous trade agreements with China during
the year. The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China
also signed an accord to create the world's largest free-trade area by 2010.
Some analysts expect China's 2004 foreign direct investment inflows to surpass
US$60 billion, exceeding 2003's US$53.5 billion. 1 November's consumer price
index (CPI) rose a healthier 2.8%, compared with about 4%-5% in the preceding
few months, easing pressure on the central bank for another interest rate hike
after the 27 basis points increase in October.2 Some forecasts for 2005 gross
domestic product (GDP) growth are for a gradual slowdown from the 9.3% expected
in 2004. 3

2 |  Annual Report
<PAGE>
Taiwan's third quarter 2004 GDP grew 5.3% compared with 7.9% in the second
quarter mainly due to slower export growth. Some analysts expect GDP growth to
slow in 2005 as external trade, a large contributor to the island's GDP,
continued to weaken. Unemployment continued on a downward trend with December's
jobless rate dropping to 4.09%, its lowest in three and a half years.4 In
December legislative elections, the opposition KMT-led Pan-Blue alliance won a
majority, taking 114 seats out of 225, while President Chen Shui-Bian stepped
down as the Democratic Progressive Party chairman to take responsibility for his
party's loss. President Chen also proposed holding a referendum on a new
constitution in 2006, raising tensions with China during the period.

In what some view as a controversial move, Hong Kong's Housing Authority
indefinitely delayed the listing of the Link Real Estate and Investment Trust,
which if completed, would have been Hong Kong's largest initial public offering
in 2004. The decision came after the courts declined to reduce the 28-day appeal
period to a public housing tenant who lost a last-minute judicial review against
the privatization of the assets. Hong Kong continued to release strong economic
data with third quarter GDP growing 7.2% compared with the same period a year
earlier due to improving trade and tourism. The government expected 7.5% GDP
growth for 2004. 5

Greater China markets, with the exception of Hong Kong, underperformed regional
markets mainly due to concerns over a hard landing in China's economy and
continuing tension between Taiwan and China. A shift in investor focus from
technology to commodity stocks in 2004 also led to further pressure on Taiwan's
stock market, where a majority of the listed companies are technology-related.
Although the Taiwanese market did end the period up 9.83% in U.S. dollar terms,
most of that gain resulted from a weakening U.S. dollar.6 Hong Kong's market
benefited from a strong recovery in tourism, economic growth and a revival in
the property sector.


INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies,

<PAGE>
research and development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and
sources, profit margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government
regulation, management and other factors in comparison to other companies around
the world which we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.


MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2004, the Morgan Stanley Capital
International (MSCI) China Index posted 1.89% total return. 7

In terms of performance, the Fund's overweighted positions, relative to the MSCI
China Index, in Dairy Farm International Holdings, Hang Lung Group and Cheung
Kong Infrastructure Holdings contributed to Fund returns. An underweighted
position in China Life Insurance also boosted performance. However, the Fund's
underweighted position in China Mobile and no position in CNOOC negatively
impacted relative performance. The Fund did not hold CNOOC because, in our view,
we found better value in other companies within the same sector. We increased
the Fund's China Mobile (Hong Kong) holdings during the period.

By industry, the Fund's overweighted positions in real estate and food and
staples retailing, as well as an underweighted position in auto components and
no exposure to automobiles, contributed to the Fund's returns relative to the
MSCI China Index. Conversely, the Fund's underweighted position in the
telecommunication services sector and lack of energy holdings detracted from
Fund performance.8 We had no energy sector exposure as the sector performed well
in 2004, resulting in what we considered expensive valuations. Thus, consistent
with our strategy, the Fund continued to invest in other stocks, which we
believed traded at more attractive valuations.

In general, if the value of the U.S. dollar goes up compared with a foreign
currency, an investment traded in that foreign currency will go down in value
because it will be worth fewer U.S. dollars. This can have a negative effect on
Fund performance. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to a
foreign currency, an investment traded in that foreign currency will increase in
value, which can contribute to Fund performance. For the 12 months ended
December 31, 2004, the U.S. dollar declined in value relative to most non-U.S.
currencies. At the end of the period, the Fund's portfolio was invested
predominantly in securities with non-U.S. currency exposure, which resulted in a
positive effect on Fund performance. However, one cannot expect the same result
in future periods.

During the year, we reduced the Fund's exposure to China H shares (Hong
Kong-listed Chinese companies) as valuations increased after their strong
performance. In particular, we sold oil and gas and transportation
infrastructure holdings as high commodity prices and robust infrastructure in
China boosted stock prices. Major sales included PetroChina, Jiangsu Expressway,
Sinopec Beijing Yanhua Petrochemical and China Petroleum & Chemical. As a
result, the Fund's exposure to China H shares fell to 10.6% of total net assets
on December 31, 2004, from 29.5% on December 31, 2003. The Fund also realized
gains on Red Chip share China Merchants Holdings, a conglomerate specializing in
infrastructure.

As we continued our search for value stocks in the greater China region, we
undertook significant purchases in Taiwan, increasing the Fund's exposure to
25.4% of total net assets at year-end from 19.7% a year earlier. Additions
included Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, a leading global integrated circuit
producer; Mega Financial Holdings, one of Taiwan's largest financial holding
companies; and Acer, a dominant player in the global personal computer market.
Elsewhere in the region, we invested in HSBC Holdings, one of the world's
largest banking and financial services organizations; and China Mobile (Hong
Kong), a dominant wireless telecommunications operator with over 170 million
subscribers in China. These purchases enlarged the Fund's exposure to the
commercial banks, semiconductors and semiconductor equipment, and wireless
telecommunication services sectors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund), is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company. The
Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing at least 45% of its total
assets in the equity securities of "China companies," as defined in the Fund's
prospectus.

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System, are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price
of the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. The value is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the
foreign exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the
value of the foreign security is determined. If no sale is reported at that
time, the foreign security will be valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Some methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Occasionally, events occur between the
time at which trading in a security is completed and the close of the NYSE that
might call into question the availability (including the reliability) of the
value of a portfolio security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the
securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may include the use
of independent pricing services. All security valuation procedures are approved
by the Fund's Board of Directors.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Directors.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under Sub Chapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income. Fund
distributions to shareholders are determined on an income tax basis and may
differ from net investment income and realized gains for financial reporting
purposes.





                                                              Annual Report | 17
<PAGE>
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liability arising out of the performance
of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the
Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.


2. CAPITAL STOCK

In December 2004, the Board of Directors of the Fund authorized management to
re-implement the Fund's open-market share repurchase program. Originally
implemented in October 1997, the Fund's Board of Directors had discontinued the
open-market share repurchase program in May 2002, in connection with the Fund's
previously conducted tender offers. Under the program, the Fund may purchase,
from time to time, shares of the Fund's common stock in open-market
transactions, at the discretion of the Fund's investment manager.

At December 31, 2004, there were 100 million shares authorized ($.01 par value).

4. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2004, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.


5. INCOME TAXES

At December 31, 2004, the Fund had deferred capital losses occurring subsequent
to October 31, 2004, of $2,401,388. For tax purposes, such losses will be
reflected in the year ending December 31, 2005.

Net investment income (loss) differs for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions.

Net realized losses differ for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of wash sales and foreign currency transactions.

At December 31, 2004, the cost of investments, net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation), undistributed ordinary income and undistributed long term
capital gains for income tax purposes were as follows:

Cost of investments .................................       $479,162,382
                                                            -------------

7. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Franklin Advisers Inc. (an affiliate of the Fund's investment manager).
Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the Sweep
Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the Sweep
Money Fund.

8. RECENT LITIGATION

Pursuant to a settlement agreement which was announced on March 20, 2003,
between the Fund and Harvard College, a former shareholder of the Fund, Harvard
Management Company, Inc. ("Harvard Management"), which is an investment advisor
to Harvard College, and Steven Alperin, an officer of Harvard Management
(referred to collectively as "Harvard"), the Fund agreed to take, and the Board
approved, the following actions, among other actions, which have already been
carried out.

o  IN-KIND TENDER OFFERs--The Fund has applied to the SEC for an exemptive order
   allowing the Fund to make occasional, non-periodic tender offers, each for up
   to 20% of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price equal to 95% of net asset
   value per share as of the date the offer expires, to be paid entirely in kind
   through a pro rata distribution of marketable portfolio securities and
   available cash. Subject to certain conditions, the settlement required the
   Fund to commence such an in-kind tender offer for 20% of the Fund's shares
   within three months after obtaining the SEC exemption. The Fund has also been
   required under the settlement to conduct, on substantially identical terms,
   up to two additional in-kind tender offers under certain circumstances. There
   is no assurance that the SEC will issue the exemptive order, nor is it
   possible to predict the date when an exemptive order might be granted.

o  ADDITIONAL CASH TENDER OFFERS--If the SEC did not issue the exemptive order
   for in-kind tender offers by March 26, 2004, the settlement provided that the
   Fund could, but was not obligated to, conduct an additional cash tender
   offer, and possibly later follow-on cash tender offers, each for 15% of the
   Fund's outstanding shares at a price of 92.5% of net asset value per share as
   of the date the offer expires. Under certain circumstances, if the Fund did
   not conduct these tender offers, Harvard would be relieved of its obligation
   to refrain from making shareholder proposals and taking other actions with
   respect to the Fund. The exemptive application was not received by March 26,
   2004 and the Fund did not conduct any tender offers in 2004.

The settlement agreement provides that the Fund will not be obligated to
commence in-kind tender offers or additional cash tender offers under certain
circumstances or conditions. These relate to, among other things, the number of
shares tendered by shareholders into preceding tender offers as well as the
beneficial ownership percentages of the Fund's shareholders.

8. RECENT LITIGATION (CONTINUED)

STANDSTILL. As part of the settlement, Harvard agreed not to submit any
proposals for consideration by shareholders of the Fund, or any other closed-end
fund or similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates, or for
consideration by shareholders of Franklin Resources, nor to encourage others to
do so, for a period of four years. Harvard also has agreed not at any time to
acquire additional shares of the Fund or any other closed-end fund or similar
investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS

INVESTIGATIONS
As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO"), and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), relating to certain
practices in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and
marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (as used in this section,
together, the "Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and
employees of the Company, received subpoenas and/or requests for documents,
information and/or testimony. The Company and its current employees provided
documents and information in response to those requests and subpoenas.

SETTLEMENTS
Beginning in August 2004, the Company entered into settlements with certain
regulators investigating the mutual fund industry practices noted above. The
Company believes that settlement of each of the matters described in this
section is in the best interest of the Company and shareholders of the Franklin,
Templeton, and Mutual Series mutual funds (the "funds").

On August 2, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that its subsidiary,
Franklin Advisers, Inc., reached an agreement with the SEC that resolved the
issues resulting from the SEC investigation into market timing activity. In
connection with that agreement, the SEC issued an "Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and
203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
and a Cease-and-Desist Order" (the "Order"). The SEC's Order concerned the
activities of a limited number of third parties that ended in 2000 and those
that were the subject of the first Massachusetts administrative complaint
described below.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

SETTLEMENTS (CONTINUED)
Under the terms of the SEC's Order, pursuant to which Franklin Advisers, Inc.
neither admitted nor denied any of the findings contained therein, Franklin
Advisers, Inc. agreed to pay $50 million, of which $20 million is a civil
penalty, to be distributed to shareholders of certain funds in accordance with a
plan to be developed by an independent distribution consultant. At this time, it
is unclear which funds or which shareholders of any particular fund will receive
distributions. The Order also required Franklin Advisers, Inc. to, among other
things, enhance and periodically review compliance policies and procedures.

On September 20, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that two of its
subsidiaries, Franklin Advisers, Inc. and Franklin Templeton Alternative
Strategies, Inc. ("FTAS"), reached an agreement with the Securities Division of
the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the "State of
Massachusetts") related to its administrative complaint filed on February 4,
2004, concerning one instance of market timing that was also a subject of the
August 2, 2004 settlement that Franklin Advisers, Inc. reached with the SEC, as
described above.

Under the terms of the settlement consent order issued by the State of
Massachusetts, Franklin Advisers, Inc. and FTAS consented to the entry of a
cease-and-desist order and agreed to pay a $5 million administrative fine to the
State of Massachusetts (the "Massachusetts Consent Order"). The Massachusetts
Consent Order included two different sections: "Statements of Fact" and
"Violations of Massachusetts Securities Laws." Franklin Advisers, Inc. and FTAS
admitted the facts in the Statements of Fact.

On October 25, 2004, the State of Massachusetts filed a second administrative
complaint, alleging that Franklin Resources, Inc.'s Form 8-K filing (in which it
described the Massachusetts Consent Order and stated that "Franklin did not
admit or deny engaging in any wrongdoing") failed to state that Franklin
Advisers, Inc. and FTAS admitted the Statements of Fact portion of the
Massachusetts Consent Order (the "Second Complaint"). Franklin Resources, Inc.
reached a second agreement with the State of Massachusetts on November 19, 2004,
resolving the Second Complaint. As a result of the November 19, 2004 settlement,
Franklin Resources, Inc. filed a new Form 8-K. The terms of the Massachusetts
Consent Order did not change and there was no monetary fine associated with this
second settlement.

On November 17, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that Franklin/Templeton
Distributors, Inc. ("FTDI") reached an agreement with the CAGO, resolving the
issues resulting from the CAGO's investigation concerning sales and marketing
support payments. Under the terms of the settlement, FTDI neither admitted nor
denied the allegations in the CAGO's complaint and agreed to pay $2 million to
the State of California as a civil penalty, $14 million to the funds, to be
allocated by an independent distribution consultant to be paid for by FTDI, and
$2 million to the CAGO for its investigative costs.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

SETTLEMENTS (CONTINUED)
On December 13, 2004, Franklin Resources, Inc. announced that its subsidiaries
FTDI and Franklin Advisers, Inc. reached an agreement with the SEC, resolving
the issues resulting from the SEC's investigation concerning marketing support
payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares. In connection with that
agreement, the SEC issued an "Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions
Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and Section 15(b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934" (the "Second Order").

Under the terms of the Second Order, in which FTDI and Franklin Advisers, Inc.
neither admitted nor denied the findings contained therein, they agreed to pay
the funds a penalty of $20 million and disgorgement of $1 (one dollar). FTDI and
Franklin Advisers, Inc. also agreed to implement certain measures and
undertakings relating to marketing support payments to broker-dealers for the
promotion or sale of fund shares, including making additional disclosures in the
funds' Prospectuses and Statements of Additional Information. The Second Order
further requires the appointment of an independent distribution consultant, at
the Company's expense, who shall develop a plan for the distribution of the
penalty and disgorgement to the funds.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company and other funds, and certain current and former officers, employees,
and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits in different federal courts
in Nevada, California, Illinois, New York and Florida, alleging violations of
various federal securities laws and seeking, among other relief, monetary
damages, restitution, removal of fund trustees, directors, advisers,
administrators, and distributors, rescission of management contracts and 12b-1
Plans, and/or attorneys' fees and costs. Specifically, the lawsuits claim breach
of duty with respect to alleged arrangements to permit market timing and/or late
trading activity, or breach of duty with respect to the valuation of the
portfolio securities of certain Templeton funds managed by Franklin Resources,
Inc. subsidiaries, resulting in alleged market timing activity. The majority of
these lawsuits duplicate, in whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the
February 4, 2004 Massachusetts administrative complaint and the findings in the
SEC's August 2, 2004 Order, as described above. The lawsuits are styled as class
actions, or derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or Franklin
Resources, Inc.

In addition, the Company, as well as certain current and former officers,
employees, and directors, have been named in multiple lawsuits alleging
violations of various securities laws and pendent state law claims relating to
the disclosure of directed brokerage payments and/or payment of allegedly
excessive advisory, commission, and distribution fees, and seeking, among other
relief, monetary damages, restitution, rescission of advisory contracts,
including recovery of all fees paid pursuant to those contracts, an accounting
of all monies paid to the named advisers, declaratory relief, injunctive relief,
and/or attorneys' fees and costs. These lawsuits are styled as class actions or
derivative actions brought on behalf of certain funds.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)
The Company and fund management strongly believes that the claims made in each
of the lawsuits identified above are without merit and intends to vigorously
defend against them. The Company cannot predict with certainty, however, the
eventual outcome of the remaining governmental investigations or private
lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the Company.
Public trust and confidence are critical to the Company's business and any
material loss of investor and/or client confidence could result in a significant
decline in assets under management by the Company, which would have an adverse
effect on the Company's future financial results. If the Company finds that it
bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that caused
losses to the Fund, it is committed to making the Fund or its shareholders
whole, as appropriate. The Company is committed to taking all appropriate
actions to protect the interests of its funds' shareholders.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON DRAGON FUND, INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") at December 31, 2004, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN


The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan (other than shareholders holding
their shares through Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, who will not be
enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and they elect to
participate), unless he elects to withdraw. If the shares are registered in the
name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the
broker-dealer or nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the
shareholder's behalf unless the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless
the reinvestment service is not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Agent must receive
written notice within 10 business days before the record date for the
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attn:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator shall apply such payments
(less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to
purchases of the Fund's shares in the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.





28 |  Annual Report
<PAGE>
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN (CONTINUED)


The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services LLC,
P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant
will receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in the participant's
name for all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant
wishes, the Plan Administrator will sell the participant's shares and send the
proceeds, less a service charge and less trading fees. Effective April 23, 2004,
the fees for the sale of shares through the Plan are $15.00 per transaction plus
a $0.12 per share trading fee. All other terms and conditions of the Plan remain
in effect and have not been modified or amended.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)


Under Section 852(b)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund hereby
designates $15,546,596 as a capital gain dividend for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004.

Under Section 854(b)(2) of the Code, the Fund hereby designates up to a maximum
of $3,173,745 as qualified dividends for purposes of the maximum rate under
Section 1(h)(11) of the Code for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. In
January 2005, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include their
share of qualified dividends distributed during the calendar year 2004.
Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for information on the
treatment of these amounts on their individual income tax returns.

At December 31, 2004, more than 50% of the Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.'s total
assets were invested in securities of foreign issuers. In most instances,
foreign taxes were withheld from dividends paid to the Fund on these
investments. As shown in the table below, the Fund hereby designates to
shareholders the foreign source income and foreign taxes paid, pursuant to
Section 853 of the Code. This designation will allow shareholders of record on
December 31, 2004, to treat their proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by
the Fund as having been paid directly by them. The shareholder shall consider
these amounts as foreign taxes paid in the tax year in which they receive the
Fund distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis, by country, of foreign tax
paid, foreign source income, foreign qualified dividends, and adjusted foreign
source income as designated by the Fund, to Class A shareholders of record. As a
service to individual shareholders filing Form 1116, "Adjusted Foreign Source
Income per Share" in column 4 below reports foreign source income with the
required adjustments to foreign source qualified dividends. This information is
provided to simplify your reporting of foreign source income for line 1 of Form
1116.

minimum of 16 days during the 30-day period beginning 15 days before the
ex-dividend date of the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate).

Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends without adjustment for the lower U.S.
tax rates. Generally, this is the foreign source income to be reported by
certain trusts and corporate shareholders.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)


Foreign Qualified Dividends per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund. If you are an individual shareholder who
does not meet the qualified dividend holding period requirements, you may find
this information helpful to calculate the foreign source income adjustment
needed to complete line 1 of Form 1116.

Adjusted Foreign Source Income per Share (Column 4) is the adjusted amount per
share of foreign source income the Fund paid to you. These amounts reflect the
Foreign Source Income reported in column 2 adjusted for the tax rate
differential on foreign source qualified dividends that may be required for
certain individual shareholders pursuant to Internal Revenue Code 904(b)(2)(B).
If you are an individual shareholder who meets the qualified dividend holding
period requirements, generally, these Adjusted Foreign Source Income amounts may
be reported directly on line 1 of Form 1116 without additional adjustment.

In January 2005, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2004. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has been
reduced to take into account the tax rate differential on foreign source
qualified dividend income pursuant to Internal Revenue Code 904(b)(2)(B).
Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for information on the
treatment of these amounts on their 2004 individual income tax returns.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.  N/A


ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has  delegated  the authority to vote proxies
related  to the  portfolio  securities  held by the Fund to the  Fund's  manager
Templeton Asset  Management Ltd in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in  analyzing  proxies,  the manager  subscribes  to  Institutional
Shareholder  Services (ISS), an  unaffiliated  third party corporate  governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote  recommendations,  recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager  subscribes to Glass Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third  party   analytical   research   firm,   to  receive   analyses  and  vote
recommendations  on the  shareholder  meetings of publicly held U.S.  companies.
Although  ISS'  and/or  Glass  Lewis'  analyses  are  thoroughly   reviewed  and
considered  in making a final  voting  decision,  the manager  does not consider
recommendations   from  ISS,  Glass  Lewis  or  any  other  third  party  to  be
determinative  of the  manager's  ultimate  decision.  The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers,  directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose  interests  conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders.  All conflicts are resolved
in the  interests of the  manager's  clients.  In  situations  where the manager
perceives  a material  conflict  of  interest,  the manager  may:  disclose  the
conflict to the Fund's board of directors; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of directors,  ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services;  or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION  OF  AUDITORS  OF  PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES.  In light of several  high
profile  accounting  scandals,  the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance  of  auditors.  On a  case-by-case  basis,  the manager will examine
proposals  relating to non-audit  relationships  and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis,  proposals to rotate auditors,  and
will  vote  against  the  ratification  of  auditors  when  there is  clear  and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT & DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans and/or the Glass Lewis
evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Shareholders may view the complete Policies on-line at franklintempleton.com.
Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the Policies free of charge by
calling the Proxy Group collect at 1-954/847-2268 or by sending a written
request to: Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC, 500 East Broward Boulevard, Suite
1500, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, Attention: Proxy Group. Copies of the Fund's
proxy voting records are available on-line at franklintempleton.com and posted
on the SEC website at www.sec.gov and reflect the twelve-month period beginning
July 1, 2003, and ending June 30, 2004.

There have been no changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes
in the Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation in connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR.

It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

         Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

         Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

         OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

         Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

         Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

         These reports will be reviewed by the Legal Department for compliance
with the Code.

         There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

         Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will
provide a report to the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the
next regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

         Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any
particular situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any approvals or waivers/4 sought by any Chief Executive
Officers of the Funds.

         The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and
enforcing this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has
       occurred, it will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the
       appropriate FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action,
       which may include review of, and appropriate modifications to,
       applicable policies and procedures; notification to appropriate
       personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a recommendation
       to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent  Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their
counsel.

IX. Internal Use

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the FT Funds and
does not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any
fact, circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

         Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment
company to disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the
report, it has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's
principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting
officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of
whether these officers are employed by the registrant or a third party. If the
registrant has not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not
done so.

         The registrant must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as
an exhibit to its annual report; (2) post the text of the code on its Internet
website and disclose, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake in its most recent report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such request may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or
waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a provision of the code in the
registrant's annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such information on its website, it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

         The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the foregoing disclosure is omitted or is determined
to be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with
the SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

         In such an event, the Fund Chief Compliance Officer shall review the
Code and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or appropriate to
prevent reoccurrences.
