PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND FUND SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH MORE
OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The returns shown in this report do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a
shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.
Performance of share classes will vary due to differences in sales charges and
expenses. Average annual total return with sales charges includes payment of the
maximum sales charge of 3.25 percent for Class A shares, an early withdrawal
charge of 3.00 percent for Class B shares (in year one and declining to zero
after year five), an early withdrawal charge of 1.00 percent for Class C shares
in year one, and combined distribution fees and service fees of up to 0.25
percent for Class A shares and up to 1.00 percent for Class B and C shares and a
service fee of up to 0.15 percent for Class IC shares. Figures shown above
assume reinvestment of all distributions. The fund's adviser has waived or
reimbursed fees and expenses from time to time; absent such
waivers/reimbursements, the fund's returns would have been lower.

                                                                               1

Fund Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

During the six-month period ended January 31, 2006, positive economic and
corporate trends created a favorable backdrop for the senior loan asset class.
The Gulf Coast hurricanes did not dampen the U.S. economy to the extent some had
expected, nor did high oil prices and struggles of the auto industry. Inflation
remained largely contained. By and large, corporations posted good profits,
reflecting on-track business strategies, increasing revenues, strengthening
balance sheets and improving credit quality. Despite some well publicized
exceptions, corporate debt default rates remained low overall. These influences
stoked ongoing demand for senior loans, from institutional and individual
investors alike.

Moreover, the adjustable-rate characteristics of senior loans proved
particularly beneficial during the period. Because the yields of senior loans
adjust in tandem to changes in short-term interest rates, the asset class was
well positioned as interest rates rose across the short- and intermediate-term
portions of the bond market.

The strong demand for senior loans was met by robust supply in both the primary
and secondary markets. Merger-and-acquisition activity, leveraged buyouts
(private-to-public transactions), sponsor-driven dividend loans and second lien
loans were among the activities spurring issuance. In this environment, yield
spreads in the senior loan market held steady.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The fund returned 1.77 percent for the six months ended January 31, 2006 (Class
A shares, unadjusted for sales charges).

The performance for the five share classes varies because each has different
expenses. The fund's total return figures assume the reinvestment of all
distributions, but do not reflect the deduction of any applicable sales charges.
Such costs would lower performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results. See Performance Summary for standardized performance information.

We believe that the rigor of our approach and our experience in the senior loan
market were principal drivers of the fund's performance of the period. We
managed the fund according to our research intensive, time-tested approach,
seeking to balance yield with a stable net asset value. Our investment process

 2
<PAGE>

focused on identifying companies with strong management, solid and predictable
cash flows, and sufficient collateral in the event of default.

Consistent with our dedication to risk management, we diversified the portfolio
broadly across the senior loan market. We followed a bottom-up security
selection process, with investment decisions driven principally by our analysis
of individual company fundamentals. That said, the portfolio construction
process was also informed by our comprehensive analysis of larger industry and
sector trends. Notably, the fund's positioning reflected a defensive tilt
throughout the period. Our criteria led us to favor senior loans in sectors that
typically provide stable performance throughout an economic cycle. For example,
the fund includes debt issued by food, drug and beverage companies, cable
broadcasters, and leisure companies. These companies have historically enjoyed
steady day-to-day demand for goods and services. The fund also included holdings
in the defense industry; these issuers were well positioned to benefit from
long-term demand trends, and held extensive hard assets as loan collateral.

In contrast, we avoided companies we believed to be especially susceptible to
cyclical economic downturns or rising fuel prices. We were particularly
circumspect in regard to the highly leveraged auto and airline industries. This
prudence served the fund well during the period. We were extremely cautious
about the health care sector as well, based on concerns that an uncertain
regulatory environment and Medicaid reduction initiatives could create ongoing
turbulence for the sector.

The fund included a minimal stake in equities which it received through
corporate restructurings. This exposure contributed a degree of volatility to
overall performance during the period.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform well
or that securities in such sectors will be held by the fund in the future.

                                                                               3

       in its semiannual and annual reports within 60 days of the end of the
       fund's second and fourth fiscal quarters by filing the schedule
       electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The
       semiannual reports are filed on Form N-CSRS and the annual reports are
       filed on Form N-CSR. Van Kampen also delivers the semiannual and annual
       reports to fund shareholders, and makes these reports available on its
       public Web site, www.vankampen.com. In addition to the semiannual and
       annual reports that Van Kampen delivers to shareholders and makes
       available through the Van Kampen public Web site, each fund files a
       complete schedule of portfolio holdings with the SEC for the fund's first
       and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q. Van Kampen does not deliver the
       reports for the first and third fiscal quarters to shareholders, nor are
       the reports posted to the Van Kampen public Web site. You may, however,
       obtain the Form N-Q filings (as well as the Form N-CSR and N-CSRS
       filings) by accessing the SEC's Web site, http://www.sec.gov. You may
       also review and copy them at the SEC's Public Reference Room in
       Washington, DC. Information on the operation of the SEC's Public
       Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at (800) SEC-0330. You
       can also request copies of these materials, upon payment of a duplicating
       fee, by electronic request at the SEC's e-mail address
       (publicinfo@sec.gov) or by writing the Public Reference section of the
       SEC, Washington, DC 20549-0102.

       You may obtain copies of a fund's fiscal quarter filings by contacting
       Van Kampen Client Relations at (800) 847-2424.

HOUSEHOLDING NOTICE

       To reduce fund expenses, the fund attempts to eliminate duplicate
       mailings to the same address. The fund delivers a single copy of certain
       shareholder documents to investors who share an address, even if the
       accounts are registered under different names. The fund's prospectuses
       and shareholder reports (including annual privacy notices) will be
       delivered to you in this manner indefinitely unless you instruct us
       otherwise. You can request multiple copies of these documents by either
       calling (800) 341-2911 or writing to Van Kampen Investor Services at 1
       Parkview Plaza, P.O. Box 5555, Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181. Once Investor
       Services has received your instructions, we will begin sending individual
       copies for each account within 30 days.

       You may obtain a copy of the fund's Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures
       without charge, upon request, by calling toll free (800) 847-2424 or by

       Securities and Exchange Commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.

       You may obtain information regarding how the fund voted proxies relating
       to portfolio securities during the most recent twelve-month period ended
       June 30 without charge by visiting our Web site at www.vankampen.com.
       This information is also available on the Securities and Exchange

                                                                               7

Expense Example

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments of Class A Shares
and contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions of Class B and Class C
Shares; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution and
service (12b-1) fees; and other Fund expenses. This example is intended to help
you understand your ongoing cost (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to
compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period 08/01/05-01/31/06.

ACTUAL EXPENSE

The first line of the table below provides information about actual account
values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together
with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the
period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, and $8,600
account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number
in the first line under the heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to
estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES

The second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical
account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense
ratio and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not
the Fund's actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not
be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for
the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing cost of
investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical
example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports
of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales
charges (loads) or contingent deferred sales charges. Therefore, the second line
of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you
determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if
these transactional costs were included, your cost would have been higher.

NR--Not rated

N/A--Not applicable

+   Bank Loans rated below Baa by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or BBB by
    Standard & Poor's Group are considered to be below investment grade.

    Industry percentages are calculated as a percentage of net assets.

(a) All or a portion of this security is segregated in connection with unfunded
    loan commitments.

(b) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(c) Affiliated company. See Notes to Financial Statements.

(d) This Senior Loan interest is non-income producing.

(e) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(f) Payment-in-kind security.

(g) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2006.

(h) Non-income producing security as this stock currently does not declare
    dividends.

(i) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents 1.0%
    of the net assets of the Fund.

(j) The borrower is in the process of restructuring or amending the terms of
    this loan.

*   Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Fund's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Fund's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Fund is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Fund estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates which
    are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus a
    premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate offered
    by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered
    Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major United
    States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans are
    generally considered to be restricted in that the Fund ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

    months of purchase. If the sales charges were included total returns would
    be lower. These returns include combined distribution and services fees of

    variable rate senior loan interests.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR LOAN FUND

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Loan Fund (the "Fund") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Fund's investment objective is to provide
a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of capital. The
Fund invests primarily in adjustable rate Senior Loans. Senior Loans are
business loans that have a senior right to payment and are made to borrowers
that may be corporations, partnerships, or other entities. These borrowers
operate in a variety of industries and geographic regions. The Fund commenced
investment operations on October 4, 1989. The Fund continuously offers Class A
Shares, Class B Shares and Class C Shares. Class IB Shares and Class IC Shares
are not continuously offered. Each class of shares differs by its initial sales
load, contingent deferred sales charges, the allocation of class-specific
expenses and voting rights on matters affecting a single class.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Fund's Senior Loans are valued by the Fund following
valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the Fund's Board
of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans for which reliable
market quotes are readily available are valued at the mean of such bid and ask
quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily available, Senior Loans are
valued, where possible, using independent market indicators provided by
independent pricing sources approved by the Board of Trustees. Other Senior
Loans are valued by independent pricing sources approved by the Board of
Trustees based upon pricing models developed, maintained and operated by those
pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset Management (the "Adviser") by
considering a number of factors including consideration of market indicators,
transactions in instruments which the Adviser believes may be comparable
(including comparable credit quality, interest rate redetermination period and
maturity), the credit worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the
period until the next interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such
Senior Loans. Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial
paper, negotiable certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate
securities which have adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the
Fund's portfolio. The fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by
the Fund's Valuation Committee and Board of Trustees.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the
direction of the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment. The Fund may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Fund acquires ownership of a

debt security and the seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time
and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the
underlying debt security. The Fund will make payment for such securities only
upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the
custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the value of the underlying
security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due the Fund.

B.  SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are expected to result in the restructuring of or a plan
of reorganization for an investment are recorded as realized losses.

C.  INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees on senior loans
purchased are treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and
discounts are accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note
or other fixed-income security.

    Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees which are recorded
when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for agreeing to changes
in loan agreements. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains or losses
are allocated on a pro-rata basis to each class of shares except for
distribution and service fees, which are unique to each class of shares.

D.  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2005, the Fund had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $1,027,665,325, which will expire according to the following
schedule.

Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $2,022,532

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial and tax reporting

purposes at the end of the fiscal year.

respectively.

5. REPURCHASE OF SHARES

The Fund has adopted the following fundamental policies in relation to its
repurchase offers, which cannot be changed without the approval of the holders
of a majority of the Fund's outstanding shares: the Fund has a policy of making
periodic repurchase offers ("Repurchase Offers") for the Fund's common shares
pursuant to Rule 23c-3(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"); Repurchase Offers will be made at periodic intervals of, initially,
quarterly (the "Periodic Interval"); provided, that the Periodic Interval shall
become one month without any additional action by the Board of Trustees, and
without the requirement of a shareholder vote, upon the Securities and Exchange
Commission granting exemptive relief to the Fund from the provisions of Rule
23c-3 of the 1940 Act; the repurchase request deadline will be the third Friday
of each month (or the

                                                                              43

preceding business day if such third Friday is not a business day) in which a
Repurchase Offer ends (the "Request Deadline"); and the repurchase pricing date
for a Repurchase Offer shall occur no later than the fourteenth calendar day
after such Repurchase Offer's Request Deadline (or the next business day after
such fourteenth calendar day if the fourteenth calendar day is not a business
day). So long as the Periodic Interval is quarterly, the Fund's Repurchase
Offers will end in the months of January, April, July and October.

    During the six months ended January 31, 2006, the Fund made two Repurchase
offers pursuant to Rule 23c-3(b) as follows: During the Repurchase Offer period
ended October 21, 2005 (the Request Deadline), the Fund offered to repurchase up
to 15% of the aggregate of its outstanding shares and the total amount tendered
in such Repurchase Offer amounted to 16,604,499 shares or 6.8% of the Fund's
outstanding shares. During the Repurchase Offer period ended January 20, 2006
(the Request Deadline), the Fund offered to repurchase up to 15% of the
aggregate of its outstanding shares and the total amount tendered in such
Repurchase Offer amounted to 15,457,717 shares or 6.7% of the Fund's outstanding
shares.

6. COMMITMENTS/BORROWINGS

Pursuant to the terms of certain of the Senior Loan agreements, the Fund had
unfunded loan commitments of approximately $131,904,100 as of January 31, 2006.
The Fund intends to reserve against such contingent obligations by designating
cash, liquid securities, and liquid senior loans as a reserve. The unrealized
depreciation on these commitments of $2,102,936 as of January 31, 2006 is
reported as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

    The Fund has entered into a revolving credit agreement for an aggregate of
$300,000,000, which will terminate on November 9, 2006. The proceeds of any
borrowing by the Fund under the revolving credit agreement shall be used for
temporary liquidity purposes and funding of shareholder repurchases. Annual
commitment fees of .13% are charged on the unused portion of the credit line.
For the six months ended January 31, 2006, the Fund recognized commitment fee
expenses of approximately $366,900.

    Borrowings under this facility will bear interest at the Eurodollar rate
plus 1.00%. For the six months ended January 31, 2006, when in use, the average
daily balance of borrowings under the revolving credit agreement was $96,035,714
with a weighted average interest rate of 3.94%.

7. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Fund invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party to
the primary lending syndicate of a Senior Loan interest to corporations,
partnerships, and other entities. When the Fund purchases a participation of a
Senior Loan interest, the Fund typically enters into a contractual agreement
with the lender or other third party selling the participation, but not with the
borrower directly. As such, the Fund assumes the credit risk of the borrower,
selling participant or other persons interpositioned between the Fund and the
borrower.

8. DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE PLAN

Shares of the Fund are distributed by Van Kampen Funds, Inc. ("the
Distributor"), an affiliate of the Adviser. The Fund has adopted a distribution
plan (the "Distribution Plan") with respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class
B Shares and Class C Shares and in so doing has agreed to comply with rule 12b-1
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as if the
Fund were an open-end investment company. The Fund also has adopted a service
plan (the "Service Plan") with respect to each of its Class A Shares, Class B
Shares, Class C Shares and Class IC Shares. There is no Distribution Plan or
Service Plan for the Class IB Shares and no Distribution Plan for the Class IC
Shares. All service fees under the Service Plan applicable to Class A Shares,
Class B Shares, Class C Shares and Class IC Shares are currently being waived.
For the six months ended January 31, 2006, the Distributor waived service fees
of $492,149. This waiver is voluntary in nature and can be discontinued at any
time. Under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan, the Fund pays distribution
fees in connection with the sale and distribution of its Shares and service fees
in connection with the provision of ongoing services to shareholders of each
such class and the maintenance of shareholder accounts.

    Under the Distribution Plan and Service Plan, the Fund incurs up to a total
of 0.25%, 1.00%, 1.00%, and 0.15% (0.25% maximum) per year of the average daily
net assets of Class A Shares, Class B Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC
Shares, respectively. Due to voluntary fee waivers by the Distributor, the
aggregate distribution and service fees are currently 0.00%, 0.75%, 0.75%, and
0.00% per year of the average daily net assets for Class A Shares, Class B
Shares, Class C Shares, and Class IC Shares, respectively. Annual fees under the
Distribution Plan and Service Plan are accrued daily. The net annual fees for
Class B Shares and Class C Shares are paid monthly to the Distributor. The
amount of distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and not yet
reimbursed ("unreimbursed receivable") was approximately $231,200 and $351,000
for Class B Shares and Class C Shares, respectively. This amount may be
recovered from future payments under the distribution plan. To the extent the
unreimbursed receivable has been fully recovered, any excess fees will be
refunded to the Fund on a quarterly basis.

9. LITIGATION

On September 28, 2001 and October 11, 2001, separate complaints were filed in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois each by a
shareholder of the Fund against the Fund, the Adviser, Van Kampen Funds Inc. and
certain directors and officers of the Fund. The respective complaints, framed as
class actions, allege misstatements and omissions in the Fund's registration
statements in violation of the federal securities laws. The separate complaints
were consolidated on or about December 15, 2001, and the class was

                                                                              45

certified on or about August 26, 2002. The consolidated action is entitled
Abrams et al. v. Van Kampen Funds, Inc., et al., No. 01 C 7538 (N.D. Ill., Hart
J.). On June 3, 2005, the Court preliminarily approved a pretrial settlement of
this class action in the amount of $31,500,000. A fairness hearing on the
settlement was scheduled for November 16, 2005. Under the terms of the proposed
settlement, the Fund will not be responsible for the settlement amount. On
January 20, 2006, the Court approved a settlement and the cause of action was
dismissed with prejudice.

10. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Fund enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Fund
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

          registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
          us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in
          which this report is being prepared;

      b)  designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
          such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
          our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
          reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
          statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
          accounting principles;

      c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls
          and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
          effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of a date
          within 90 days prior to the filing date of this report based on such
          evaluation; and

      d)  disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.   The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed to the
     registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
     directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

      a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

      b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          controls over financial reporting.
