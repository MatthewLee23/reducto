The Eaton Vance organization is committed to ensuring your financial privacy.
This notice is being sent to comply with privacy regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Each of the above financial institutions has in effect
the following policy with respect to nonpublic personal information about its
customers:

- -  Only such information received from you, through application forms or
   otherwise, and information about your Eaton Vance fund transactions will be
   collected.

- -  None of such information about you (or former customers) will be disclosed to
   anyone, except as permitted by law (which includes disclosure to employees
   necessary to service your account).

- -  Policies and procedures (including physical, electronic and procedural
   safeguards) are in place that are designed to protect the confidentiality of

                                IMPORTANT NOTICE
                              REGARDING DELIVERY OF
                              SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission permits funds to deliver only one copy of
shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements and shareholder
reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same residential or
post office box address. This practice is often called "householding" and it
helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER, MAY HOUSEHOLD THE MAILING OF YOUR
DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.

From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities
held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote
proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds' and
Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and
procedures without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122. This
description is also available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's

EATON VANCE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE TRUST as of April 30, 2004
INVESTMENT UPDATE

THE TRUST

   PERFORMANCE
- -  Based on the Trust's April 2004 monthly dividend of $0.0875 and a closing
   share price of $20.07, the Trust had a market yield of 5.23%.(1) The Trust's
   market yield represented a yield advantage over many other income-producing
   vehicles during the period.

   THE TRUST'S INVESTMENTS
- -  The Trust began operations on November 28, 2003. The Trust's objective is to
   provide a high level of current income by investing in senior secured
   floating rate loans. Because floating rate loans have short interest-rate
   reset provisions, the Trust should be well-positioned in the event of a rise
   in short-term interest rates. The Trust also uses leverage in the form of
   Auction Preferred Shares to add incrementally to its yield.(2)

- -  The Trust seeks to maintain an average duration of less than one year,
   including the effect of leverage. Duration is a measure of price volatility
   of a debt instrument as a result of changes in overall interest rate levels.
   In general, a portfolio of securities with a shorter duration can be expected
   to be less price-sensitive to interest rate changes than a portfolio with a
   longer duration. The Trust also has the ability to invest in
   non-investment-grade corporate bonds, which were approximately 15.8% of the
   Trust's net assets (10.1% of total investments) at April 30.

- -  In its initial months of operation, the Trust acquired a portfolio of senior
   loans and other investments representing 248 borrowers and 48 industries as
   of April 30. The Trust's average loan size was just 0.34% of net assets, and
   no industry constituted more than 10.5% of the Trust's net assets. Food and
   beverages, auto components, cable television, publishing and printing and
   utilities were the Trust's largest sector weightings.

- -  The Trust included investments in companies we believe can benefit from an
   economic recovery, including publishing and printing and chemical companies.
   In the publishing and printing sector, investments included publishers of
   yellow page directories, as well as newspaper companies with stable,
   locally-based advertising revenues.

- -  Auto components constituted a significant weighting for the Trust.
   Investments included major suppliers of auto parts and sub-systems for both
   original equipment manufacturers and the auto aftermarket. The Trust's
   largest investment in this area enjoyed good revenue growth, improving
   margins and increasing market share.

- -  In non-economically sensitive areas, food and beverage, cable and health care
   were significant sectors. The Trust's largest loan holding was a leading
   cable operator that has achieved revenue growth from its high-speed data and
   digital video services.

INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT

   THE LOAN MARKET
- -  Benefiting from a stronger economy and an improving credit environment, the
   loan market enjoyed improved fundamentals in the six-months ended April 30,
   2004. That trend was reflected in healthier balance sheets and was most
   evident in the declining default rate.

- -  With the strong market recovery of 2003 behind it, loan market performance in
   2004 has been less influenced by price movement and more so by interest
   payments. While loan credit spreads narrowed during the period, they
   nonetheless remained at relatively attractive historical levels.

     THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN THIS REPORT ARE THOSE OF THE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS AND
     ARE CURRENT ONLY THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD OF THE REPORT AS STATED ON
     THE COVER. THESE VIEWS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME BASED UPON MARKET
     OR OTHER CONDITIONS, AND EATON VANCE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO UPDATE
     SUCH VIEWS. THESE VIEWS MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS INVESTMENT ADVICE AND,
     BECAUSE INVESTMENT DECISIONS FOR AN EATON VANCE FUND ARE BASED ON MANY
     FACTORS, MAY NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF TRADING INTENT ON BEHALF
     OF ANY EATON VANCE FUND.

   Average Annual Total Return (by share price, NYSE)
   Life of Fund (11/28/03)                                 7.02%

</Table>

   (1) THE TRUST'S MARKET YIELD IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE MOST RECENT
       DIVIDEND PER SHARE BY THE SHARE MARKET PRICE AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND
       ANNUALIZING THE RESULT. (2) IN THE EVENT OF A RISE IN LONG-TERM INTEREST
       RATES, THE VALUE OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD DECLINE, WHICH
       WOULD REDUCE THE ASSET COVERAGE FOR ITS AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES. (3)
       RETURNS ARE HISTORICAL AND ARE CALCULATED BY DETERMINING THE PERCENTAGE
       CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE OR NET ASSET VALUE WITH ALL DISTRIBUTIONS
       REINVESTED. FOR PERFORMANCE AS OF THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END, PLEASE REFER
       TO www.eatonvance.com.

       PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. INVESTMENT RETURN AND
       PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE SO THAT SHARES, WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH
       MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST. PERFORMANCE IS FOR THE STATED TIME
       PERIOD ONLY; DUE TO MARKET VOLATILITY, THE FUND'S CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY
       BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAT THE QUOTED RETURN.

   SHARES OF THE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED BY THE FDIC AND ARE NOT DEPOSITS OR OTHER
   OBLIGATIONS OF, OR GUARANTEED BY, ANY DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION. SHARES ARE
   SUBJECT TO INVESTMENT RISKS, INCLUDING POSSIBLE LOSS OF PRINCIPAL INVESTED.
   YIELD WILL CHANGE.

(1)   Senior floating-rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash
      flows or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The degree to which
      borrowers repay, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
      election, cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual
      remaining maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities
      shown. However, it is anticipated that the senior floating-rate interests
      will have an expected average life of approximately two to four years.

(2)   Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
      1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.

(3)   Security linked to a portfolio of debt securities.

NOTE: At April 30, 2004, the Trust had unfunded commitments amounting to
      $2,749,602 under various credit agreements.

EATON VANCE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE TRUST as of April 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Senior Floating-Rate Trust (the Trust) is registered under the
   Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a diversified closed-end
   management investment company. The Trust, which was organized as a
   Massachusetts business trust on August 5, 2003, seeks to provide a high level
   of current income. The Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek
   preservation of capital to the extent consistent with its primary goal of
   high current income. The Trust pursues its objectives by investing primarily
   in senior secured floating rate loans (Senior Loans). The following is a
   summary of significant accounting policies of the Trust. The policies are in
   conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
   of America.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATION -- Certain senior loans are deemed to be liquid if
   reliable market quotations are readily available for them. Liquid Senior
   Loans are valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing service. Other
   Senior Loans are valued at fair value by the Trust's investment adviser,
   Eaton Vance Management (EVM), under procedures established by the Trustees as
   permitted by Section 2(a)(41) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Such
   procedures include the consideration of relevant factors, data and
   information relating to fair value, including (i) the characteristics of and
   fundamental analytical data relating to the Senior Loan, including the cost,
   size, current interest rate, period until next interest rate reset, maturity
   and base lending rate of the Senior Loan, the terms and conditions of the
   Senior Loan and any related agreements, and the position of the Senior Loan
   in the Borrower's debt structure; (ii) the nature, adequacy and value of the
   collateral, including the Trust's rights, remedies and interests with respect
   to the collateral; (iii) the creditworthiness of the Borrower, based on an
   evaluation of its financial condition, financial statements and information
   about the Borrower's business, cash flows, capital structure and future
   prospects; (iv) information relating to the market for the Senior Loan
   including price quotations for and trading in the Senior Loan, and interests
   in similar Senior Loans and the market environment and investor attitudes
   towards the Senior Loan and interests in similar Senior Loans; (v) the
   experience, reputation, stability and financial condition of the agent and
   any intermediate participant in the Senior Loan; and (vi) general economic
   and market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan. Non-loan
   portfolio holdings (other than short-term obligations, but including listed
   issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by one or more pricing
   services which determine prices for normal, institutional-size trading units
   of such securities which may use market information, transactions for
   comparable securities and various relationships between securities which are
   generally recognized by institutional traders. In certain circumstances,
   portfolio securities will be valued at the last sale price on the exchange
   that is the primary market for such securities, or the average of the last
   quoted bid price and asked price for those securities for which the
   over-the-counter market is the primary market or for listed securities in
   which there were no sales during the day. Marketable securities listed in the
   NASDAQ National Market System are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
   price. The value of interest rate swaps will be based upon a dealer
   quotation. Short-term obligations which mature in 60 days or less, are valued
   at amortized cost, if their original term to maturity when acquired by the
   Trust was 60 days or less or are valued at amortized cost using their value
   on the 61st day prior to maturity, if their original term to maturity when
   acquired by the Trust was more than 60 days, unless in each case this is
   determined not to represent fair value. OTC options are valued at the mean
   between bid and asked prices provided by dealers. Financial futures contracts
   listed on commodity exchanges and exchange-traded options are valued at
   closing settlement prices. Securities for which there is no such quotation or
   valuation are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by
   or at the direction of the Trustees. Repurchase agreements are valued at cost
   plus accrued interest. Other portfolio securities for which there are no
   quotations or valuations are valued at fair value as determined in good faith
   by or on behalf of the Trustees.

   B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual
   basis at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is
   determined on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of
   premium or accretion of discount. Dividend income is recorded on the
   ex-dividend date for dividends received in cash and/or securities.

   C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any
   net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal
   income or excise tax is necessary.

   D INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS -- Investment transactions are recorded on a trade
   date basis. Realized gains and losses from such transactions are determined
   using the specific identification method. Securities purchased or sold on a
   when-issued or delayed delivery basis may be settled a month or more after
   the transaction

                                       21
<Page>

   date. The securities so purchased are subject to market fluctuations during
   this period. To the extent that when-issued or delayed delivery purchases are
   outstanding, the Trust instructs the custodian to segregate assets in a
   separate account, with a current value at least equal to the amount of its
   purchase commitments.

   E OFFERING COSTS -- Costs incurred by the Trust in connection with the
   offering of the common shares and preferred shares were recorded as a
   reduction of capital paid in excess of par applicable to common shares.

   F EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
   fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
   balance the Trust maintains with IBT. All significant credit balances used to
   reduce the Trust's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses on
   the Statement of Operations.

   G WRITTEN OPTIONS -- Upon the writing of a call or a put option, an amount
   equal to the premium received by the Trust is included in the Statement of
   Assets and Liabilities as a liability. The amount of the liability is
   subsequently marked-to-market to reflect the current value of the option
   written in accordance with the Trust's policies on investment valuations
   discussed above. Premiums received from writing options which expire are
   treated as realized gains. Premiums received from writing options which are
   exercised or are closed are added to or offset against the proceeds or amount
   paid on the transaction to determine the realized gain or loss. If a put
   option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the securities
   purchased by the Trust. The Trust, as writer of an option, may have no
   control over whether the underlying securities may be sold (call) or
   purchased (put) and, as a result, bears the market risk of an unfavorable
   change in the price of the securities underlying the written option.

   H PURCHASED OPTIONS -- Upon the purchase of a call or put option, the premium
   paid by the Trust is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as
   an investment. The amount of the investment is subsequently marked-to-market
   to reflect the current market value of the option purchased, in accordance
   with the Trust's policies on investment valuations discussed above. If an
   option which the Trust has purchased expires on the stipulated expiration
   date, the Trust will realize a loss in the amount of the cost of the option.
   If the Trust enters into a closing sale transaction, the Trust will realize a
   gain or loss, depending on whether the sales proceeds from the closing sale
   transaction are greater or less than the cost of the option. If the Trust
   exercises a put option, it will realize a gain or loss from the sale of the
   underlying security, and the proceeds from such sale will be decreased by the
   premium originally paid. If the Trust exercises a call option, the cost of
   the security which the Trust purchases upon exercise will be increased by the
   premium originally paid.

   I FINANCIAL FUTURES CONTRACTS -- Upon entering into a financial futures
   contract, the Trust is required to deposit an amount (initial margin) either
   in cash or securities equal to a certain percentage of the purchase price
   indicated in the financial futures contract. Subsequent payments are made or
   received by the Trust (margin maintenance) each day, dependent on the daily
   fluctuations in the value of the underlying securities, and are recorded for
   book purposes as unrealized gains or losses by the Trust.

   If the Trust enters into a closing transaction, the Trust will realize, for
   book purposes, a gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of
   the financial futures contract to sell and the financial futures contract to
   buy. The Trust's investment in financial futures contracts is designed only
   to hedge against anticipated future changes in interest rates. Should
   interest rates move unexpectedly, the Trust may not achieve the anticipated
   benefits of the financial futures contracts and may realize a loss.

   J REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS -- The Trust may enter into reverse
   repurchase agreements. Under such an agreement, the Trust temporarily
   transfers possession, but not ownership, of a security to a counterparty, in
   return for cash. At the same time, the Trust agrees to repurchase the
   security at an agreed-upon price and time in the future. The Trust may enter
   into reverse repurchase agreements for temporary purposes, such as to Trust
   withdrawals, or for use as hedging instruments where the underlying security
   is denominated in a foreign currency. As a form of leverage, reverse
   repurchase agreements may increase the risk of fluctuation in the market
   value of the Trust's assets or in its yield. Liabilities to counterparties
   under reverse repurchase agreements are recognized in the Statement of Assets
   and Liabilities at the same time at which cash is received by the Trust. The
   securities underlying such agreements continue to be treated as owned by the
   Trust and remain in the Portfolio of Investments. Interest charged on amounts
   borrowed by the Trust under reverse repurchase agreements is accrued daily.

   K TOTAL RETURN SWAPS -- The Trust may enter into swap agreements to enhance
   return, to hedge against fluctuations in securities prices or interest rates
   or as

                                       22
<Page>

   substitution for the purchase or sale of securities. Pursuant to these
   agreements, the Trust makes monthly payments at a rate equal to a
   predetermined spread to the one-month LIBOR. In exchange, the Trust receives
   payments based on the rate of return of a benchmark industry index. During
   the term of the outstanding swap agreement, changes in the underlying value
   of the swap are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. Payments received or
   made at the end of the measurement period are recorded as realized gains and
   losses. The value of the swap is determined by changes in the relationship
   between the rate of interest and the benchmark industry index. The Trust is
   exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the swap
   counterparty. However, the Trust does not anticipate non-performance by the
   counterparty. Risk may also arise from the unanticipated movements in value
   of interest rates or the index.

   L CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS -- The Trust may enter into credit default swap
   contracts for risk management purposes, including diversification. When the
   Trust is the buyer of a credit default swap contract, the Trust is entitled
   to receive the par (or other agreed-upon) value of a referenced debt
   obligation from the counterparty to the contract in the event of a default by
   a third party, such as a U.S. or foreign corporate issuer, on the debt
   obligation. In return, the Trust would pay the counterparty a periodic stream
   of payments over the term of the contract provided that no event of default
   has occurred. If no default occurs, the Trust would have spent the stream of
   payments and received no benefit from the contract. When the Trust is the
   seller of a credit default swap contract, it receives the stream of payments,
   but is obligated to pay upon default of the referenced debt obligation. As
   the seller, the Trust would effectively add leverage to its portfolio
   because, in addition to its total net assets, the Trust would be subject to
   investment exposure on the notional amount of the swap. The Trust will
   segregate assets in the form of cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal
   to the aggregate market value of the credit default swaps of which it is the
   seller, marked to market on a daily basis. These transactions involve certain
   risks, including the risk that the seller may be unable to fulfill the
   transaction.

   M USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of the financial statements in
   conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
   of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
   the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   N INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Trust's organizational documents, its
   officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and
   expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Trust, and
   shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for obligations of
   the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters
   into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification
   clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as
   this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have
   not yet occurred.

   O OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the
   securities are purchased or sold. Realized gains and losses are computed
   based on the specific identification of securities sold.

   P INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- The interim financial statements relating
   to April 30, 2004 and for the period then ended have not been audited by
   independent certified public accountants, but in the opinion of the Trust's
   management reflect all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring
   adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the financial statements.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES

   The Trust issued 3,940 shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series A,
   3,940 shares of Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series B, 3,940 shares of
   Auction Preferred Shares (APS) Series C, and 3,940 shares of Auction
   Preferred Shares (APS) Series D on January 26, 2004 in a public offering. The
   underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded as a reduction
   of the capital of the common shares. Dividends on the APS, which accrue
   daily, are cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering of the
   APS and have been reset every 28 days thereafter by an auction. Dividend
   rates ranged from 1.10% to 1.125% for Series A shares, 1.109% to 1.125% for
   Series B shares, 1.08% to 1.14% for Series C shares, and 1.09% to 1.149% for
   Series D shares.

   The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, at a redemption price
   equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
   dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if the Trust is in default for an extended period on its asset
   maintenance requirements with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS
   shall remain unpaid in an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the
   holders of the APS as

                                       23
<Page>

   a class have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In
   general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have equal voting
   rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the APS, as a
   separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the Board of
   Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus
   accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required to maintain certain
   asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the Trust's By-Laws and
   the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Trust pays an annual fee equivalent
   to 0.25% of the preferred shares' liquidation value for the remarketing
   efforts associated with the preferred auctions.

3  DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS

   The Trust intends to make monthly distributions of net investment income,
   after payment of any dividends on any outstanding Auction Preferred Shares.
   In addition, at least annually, the Trust intends to distribute net capital
   gain, if any. Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
   Distributions to preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at
   the end of each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction
   Preferred Shares is generally twenty-eight days. The applicable dividend rate
   for the Auction Preferred Shares on April 30, 2004 was 1.11%, 1.12%, 1.14%,
   and 1.149%, for Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Shares,
   respectively. For the period ended April 30, 2004, the Trust paid dividends
   to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting to $292,101, $294,471, $291,758
   and $294,551 for Series A, Series B, Series C, and Series D Shares,
   respectively, representing an average APS dividend rate for such period of
   1.111%, 1.119%, 1.113%, and 1.121%, respectively.

   The Trust distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial
   reporting basis. Accounting principals generally accepted in the United
   States of America require that only distributions in excess of tax basis
   earnings and profits be reported in the financial statements as a return of
   capital. Permanent differences between book and tax accounting relating to
   distributions are reclassified to paid in capital. These differences relate
   primarily to the method for amortizing premiums.

4  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at an annual rate of 0.75% of the
   average daily gross assets of the Trust, was earned by Eaton Vance Management
   (EVM), as compensation for management and investment advisory services
   rendered to the Trust. For the period from the start of business, November
   28, 2003 to, the April 30, 2004, fee was equivalent to 0.75% (annualized) of
   the Trust's average daily gross assets for such period and amounted to
   $2,737,007.

   In addition, the Adviser has contractually agreed to reimburse the Trust for
   fees and other expenses in the amount of 0.20% of the average daily gross
   assets of the Trust for the first five full years of the Trust's operations,
   0.15% of average weekly gross assets in year 6, 0.10% in year 7 and 0.05% in
   year 8. For the period from the start of business, November 28, 2003 to April
   30, 2004 the Investment Adviser waived $724,187 of its advisory fee.

   EVM serves as the administrator of the Trust, but currently receives no
   compensation for providing administrative services to the Trust.

   Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of the above
   organization.

5  PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS

   Purchases and sales of investments, other than short-term obligations and
   incuding paydowns, aggregated $1,395,636,652 and $421,562,173 respectively,
   for the period from the start of business, November 28, 2003 to April 30,
   2004.

6  COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

8  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   The Trust may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in
   the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure
   to various market risks. These financial instruments include written options
   and financial futures contracts and may involve, to a varying degree,
   elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for financial statement
   purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments represent
   the investment the Trust has in particular classes of financial instruments
   and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject to risk.
   The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is meaningful
   only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

   At April 30, 2004, the Trust had entered into Credit Default Swaps with
   Credit Suisse First Boston dated January 9, 2004 and January 27, 2004 whereby
   the Trust will receive 2.45% per year times the notional amounts of
   $7,800,000 and $7,800,000, respectively. The Trust makes payment only upon a
   default event on underlying loan assets (50 in total, each representing 2% of
   the notional value of the swap). At April 30, 2004, The Trust had sufficient
   cash segregated to cover potential obligations arising from open swap
   contracts.

EATON VANCE SENIOR FLOATING-RATE TRUST

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders may elect to have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust. You may elect to
participate in the Plan be completing the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Application
Form. If you do not participate, you will receive all distributions in cash paid
by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc. as dividend paying agent. On the
distribution payment date, if the net asset value per Share is equal to or less
than the market price per Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new
Shares will be issued. The number of Shares shall be determined by the greater
of the net asset value per Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares
generally will be purchased on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions
subject to income tax (if any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC, Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.
