FRANKLIN TEMPLETON INVESTMENTS

Gain From Our Perspective


Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the
specialized expertise of three world-class investment management
groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE
Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying on its
own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines that underlie
its success.

FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a leader in tax-free investing and a
driving force in fixed income investing around the globe. They also bring
expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity investing.

TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing and, in
1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today, with
research offices in over 25 countries, they offer investors the broadest global
reach in the industry.

MUTUAL SERIES. Established in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style
of value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among undervalued
stocks, arbitrage situations and distressed companies.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION
Because our management groups work independently and adhere to distinctly
different investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
typically have a low overlap of securities. That's why our funds can be used to
build truly diversified portfolios covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST
At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the
reliable account services that have helped us become one of the most trusted
names in financial services.

We are pleased to bring you Templeton Global Income Fund's annual report for the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2003.


Performance Overview

For the 12 months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund delivered
cumulative total returns of 15.37% based on market price and 19.68% based on net
asset value, as shown in the Performance Summary on page 6. In comparison, the
J.P. Morgan Global Government Bond Index (JPM GGBI) posted a 3.59% cumulative
total return in local currency terms and a 9.14% cumulative total return in U.S.
dollar terms for the same period. 1


Economic and Market Overview

Global economic conditions supported international fixed income markets during
the Fund's fiscal year. Economic growth in the world's major economies, although
positive, pointed toward a slow global recovery. Heightened geopolitical
uncertainty leading up to the Iraq war accompanied declines in confidence and
production indicators, particularly in the U.S. and Europe.

Slow economic growth, rising unemployment and disinflationary pressures provided
a favorable environment for an accommodative monetary stance at many major
central banks. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve Board lowered the federal funds
target rate 75 basis points to 1.00%. Similarly, policymakers at the European
Central Bank (ECB) reduced its reference rate 125 basis points to 2.00%. Both
the U.S. Treasury yield curve and the euro-zone benchmark curve

shifted downward. Global bond markets responded favorably to the interest rate
declines, with the JPM GGBI increasing in local currency terms over the course
of the reporting period as stated above. 1

A predominant characteristic of global currency markets over the past fiscal
year was U.S. dollar weakness. Although the U.S. dollar strengthened late in the
period, it depreciated 8.23% relative to the nation's major trading partners for
the 12 months ended August 31, 2003. 2 Led by a widening U.S. trade deficit, the
nation's balance of payments position deteriorated, with the current account
balance reaching peak deficit levels. Additionally, with U.S. interest rates
reaching historically low levels, U.S. interest bearing securities were
generally less attractive than those of other developed nation markets with
higher interest rates.

Reduced interest rates in developed economies generally benefit emerging market
borrowers through lower borrowing costs and positive investment flows from
investors seeking higher returns outside developed countries. Emerging bond
markets, as measured by the J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (JPM
EMBIG) returned 26.84% during the 12-month period. 3 Sovereign interest rate
spreads declined from 812 basis points greater than the U.S. Treasury market at
the beginning of the reporting period to 482 basis points by period-end. 3

  What is balance of payments?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Balance of payments is a record of all of a country's exports and imports of
  goods and services, borrowing and lending with the rest of the world during a
  particular time period. It helps a country evaluate its competitive strengths
  and weaknesses and forecast the strength of its currency.


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  What is a current account?
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  A current account is that part of the balance of payments where all of one
  country's international transactions in goods and services are recorded.

Investment Strategy

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
while at the same time monitoring interest rate, exchange rate and credit risks.


Manager's Discussion

Overall, the main contributors to Fund performance were income, developed market
interest rate movements, currency returns and emerging market bonds. During the
period under review, we extended duration and maintained a significant
allocation to spread products, or high yield fixed income securities. The Fund's
positioning reflected anticipated potential, longer-term currency strength in
New Zealand and Australia, the euro and other European currencies, and weakness
in the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. We also positioned for yield curve
compression in Europe relative to U.S. Treasuries.

Templeton Global Income Fund benefited from an overweighted allocation to New
Zealand and Australia, the euro zone and other European countries relative to
the JPM GGBI during the reporting period. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand
reduced its official reference rate 75 basis points to 5.00%, while the Reserve
Bank of Australia left interest rates unchanged at 4.75%. In local currency
terms, New Zealand and Australia returned 7.83% and 6.54%. 4 As stated earlier,
ECB policymakers reduced interest rates, driving euro-zone local currency bond
market returns of 6.94%, as measured by the J.P. Morgan European Monetary Union
(EMU) Government Bond Index. 5 Similarly, Denmark lowered rates from 3.45% to
2.00%, and Sweden reduced its reference rate 150 basis points to 2.75%.
Furthermore, the Fund gained from its underweighted positions relative to the
JPM GGBI in Japan and the U.S., which returned -0.75% and 3.03% in local
currency terms, less than most other global bond markets. 4

The U.S. dollar's depreciation against most major currencies positively impacted
Fund performance during the period. Compared with the U.S. dollar, the New
Zealand dollar appreciated 23.30%, the Australian dollar 17.64%, and the
Canadian dollar 12.41%, contributing to 33.08%, 25.18% and 19.76% bond

market returns in U.S. dollar terms, respectively. The euro appreciated 11.82%
against the U.S. dollar, with EMU bond markets returning 19.82%. The Swedish
krona and Danish krone appreciated 12.32% and 11.90%, resulting in 20.87% and
20.21% bond market returns in U.S. dollar terms. The Fund also benefited from
its underweighted Japanese exposure relative to the JPM GGBI as the yen
appreciated 1.32% versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in only a 0.86% bond market
return in U.S. dollar terms. 4

The Fund also invested in emerging market sovereign debt that is typically
non-investment grade and compensates for greater credit risk by offering higher
income or coupon. During the 12-month period, emerging market returns
contributed to Fund performance as the JPM EMBIG delivered strong returns.
Regionally, Latin American sovereign debt returned 32.71%, eastern Europe 26.84%
and Asia 8.37%. Core emerging market bond positions in the Fund included Russia,
Mexico and the Philippines, which returned 31.64%, 14.24% and 13.05%,
respectively. 3

It is important to note that global investing involves special risks related to
market, currency, economic, social, political and other factors, in addition to
the heightened risks associated with the relatively small size and lesser
liquidity of emerging markets. Investing in any emerging market means accepting
a certain amount of volatility that can arise from such factors as high levels
of inflation, deflation or currency devaluation.

Thank you for your continued participation in Templeton Global Income Fund. We
look forward to serving your future investment needs.

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND, INC.

Notes to Financial Statements



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund, Inc. (the Fund) is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company. The
Fund seeks high current income, with a secondary objective of capital
appreciation. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests primarily in a
portfolio of debt securities of U.S. and foreign issuers including emerging
markets.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

a. Security Valuation

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange or NASDAQ are
valued at the last reported sales price. Over-the-counter securities and listed
securities for which no sale is reported are valued within the range of the
latest quoted bid and asked prices. Securities for which market quotations are
not readily available are valued at fair value as determined by management in
accordance with procedures established by the Board of Directors.

b. Foreign Currency Translation

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities and income items denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the recorded
amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S.
dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
foreign exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates
on foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in
securities held at the end of the reporting period.

c. Foreign Currency Contracts

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included
in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.





                                                              Annual Report | 15




TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND, INC.

Notes to Financial Statements (CONTINUED)



1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

d. Income Taxes

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income.

e. Security Transactions, Investment Income, Expenses and Distributions

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Certain income from foreign securities is recorded as soon as information is
available to the Fund. Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily.
Bond discount and premium is amortized on a yield to maturity basis. Dividend
income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

f. Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

g. Guarantees and Indemnifications

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Funds. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. CAPITAL STOCK

The Board of Directors of the Fund previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
shares of the Fund's common stock in open-market transactions, at the discretion
of management. This authorization remains in effect. Through August 31, 2003,
the Fund had repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares.

At August 31, 2003, there were 200 million shares authorized ($0.01 par value).
During the year ended August 31, 2003, 6,265 shares were issued for $43,136 from
reinvested distributions. During the year ended August 31, 2002, 91,899 shares
were issued for $669,002 from reinvested distributions.

                                                            -------------
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) ..............   $ 40,669,856

                                                            -------------

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended August 31, 2003
and 2002, was as follows:

                                         --------------------------
                                               2003        2002
                                         --------------------------
Distributions paid from:
       Ordinary Income ................  $64,756,384   $37,684,878

       Return of Capital ..............           --    21,310,810
                                         --------------------------
                                         $64,756,384   $58,995,688
                                         --------------------------

Net investment income and net realized capital gains differ for financial
statement and tax purposes primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales,
losses realized subsequent to October 31 on the sale of securities, and bond
discounts and premiums.





                                                              Annual Report | 17

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND, INC.

Independent Auditors' Report


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Templeton Global Income Fund, Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Templeton Global Income Fund,
Inc. (the "Fund") at August 31, 2003, the results of its operations for the year
then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the
period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements and financial
highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at August
31, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

Tax Designation (unaudited)


At August 31, 2003, more than 50% of the Fund's total assets were invested in
securities of foreign issuers. In most instances, foreign taxes were withheld
from dividends paid to the Fund on these investments. As shown in the table
below, the Fund hereby designates to shareholders the foreign source income and
foreign taxes paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the Internal Revenue Code. This
designation will allow shareholders of record on October 17, 2003, to treat
their proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by the Fund as having been paid
directly by them. The shareholder shall consider these amounts as foreign taxes
paid in the tax year in which they receive the Fund distribution.

The following table provides a breakdown by country of foreign source income and
foreign taxes paid, as designated by the Fund to shareholders.

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND, INC.

Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan


The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan; Stock
dividends and capital gains distributions will be reinvested automatically;
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, will
provide additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to Mellon Bank,
N.A. (the "Plan Agent"), in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of
$5,000 per month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These
payments shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A."
and sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA
15250-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund, Inc. The Plan Agent shall
apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of
trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Agent sent to Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box
3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Agent; or, if the participant wishes, the Plan
Agent will sell the participant's shares and send the proceeds, less a service
charge of $5.00 and less trading fees.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

political and other factors. The Fund and its investors are not protected from
such losses by the Investment Manager. Therefore, investors who cannot accept
this risk should not invest in shares of the Fund.

To ensure the highest quality of service, telephone calls to or from our service

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager,
Franklin Advisers, Inc., in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. Although ISS'
analyses are thoroughly reviewed and considered in making a final voting
decision, the manager does not consider recommendations from ISS or any other
third party to be determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager
votes proxies solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a
matter of policy, the officers, directors and employees of the Fund, the manager
and the Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests
conflict with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. All conflicts are
resolved in the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the
manager perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's Board of Directors; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's Board of Directors, ISS or those of another independent third party
provider of proxy services; or take such other action in good faith (in
consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and its
shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S  PROXY VOTING  POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive  list of all the  issues  that  may  arise  and  the  manager  cannot
anticipate all future  situations.  In all cases,  each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration factors such
as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and performance.

MANAGEMENT & DIRECTOR COMPENSATION A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case  basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden  parachutes" that  are
considered to be excessive.  The manager will normally support proposals  that
require a  percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as they align their interests with those of shareholders. The manager
will review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies
on expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against
any proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject
to careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every vote it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Shareholders may view the complete Policies on-line at
www.franklintempleton.com. Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the
Policies free of charge by calling the Proxy Group collect at 1-954/847-2268 or
by sending a written request to: Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC, 500 East
Broward Boulevard, Suite 1500, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, Attention: Proxy
Group. Copies of the Fund's proxy voting records will also be made available
on-line at www.franklintempleton.com and posted on the SEC website at
www.sec.gov no later than August 31, 2004 and will reflect the twelve-month
period beginning July 1, 2003, and ending June 30, 2004

ITEM 9. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS AND PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This code of ethics (the "Code")/1/ is for the investment  companies within
the complex  registered with the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission
("SEC") (collectively, "FT Funds") applies to each FT Fund's Principal Executive
Officers, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

   o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
     apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
     relationships;

   o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
     documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in other
     public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

   o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

   o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
     person or persons identified in the Code; and

   o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II. COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
    INTEREST OVERVIEW.

     A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered  Officer's  private interest
interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the FT Funds. For example,
a conflict of  interest  would  arise if a Covered  Officer, or a member of his
family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with the
FT Funds.

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships  between
Covered Officers  and the FT Funds and  already are subject  to conflict  of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund  administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three),  be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers may also be officers or employees of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code,  but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed  improperly before the
interest of the FT Funds. Each Covered Officer must:

   o Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
     influence  investment decisions or financial  reporting  by the FT Funds
     whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
     the FT Funds;

   o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
     individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
     the FT Funds;

   o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
     Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
     are made in good faith;

   o Report at least annually the following affiliations or  other
     relationships:/2/

   o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
     required to file reports with the SEC;

   o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
     directors;

   o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public
     accounting firm; and

   o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund that
     will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from the advisory,
     sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with  affiliates  of
     Franklin Resources).

   There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include/3/:

  o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

  o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;

  o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT
    Funds has current or prospective business dealings unless such
    entertainment is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
    time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
    impropriety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must
    obtain prior approval for any entertainment with a value in excess of
    $1000.

  o Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
    with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
    adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
    thereof;

  o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
    charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
    transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
    arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
    equity ownership.

    FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

   o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
     requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

   o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others
     to  misrepresent,  facts  about the FT Funds to others,  whether  within or
     outside the FT Funds,  including to the FT Funds'  directors  and auditors,
     and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

   o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
     responsibility,  consult with other officers and employees of the FT Funds,
     the adviser and the  administrator  with the goal of promoting full,  fair,
     accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents
     the FT  Funds  file  with,  or  submit  to,  the  SEC and in  other  public
     communications made by the FT Funds; and

   o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote  compliance
     with the standards and  restrictions  imposed by applicable laws, rules and
     regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

   Each Covered Officer must:

   o Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as  applicable, upon becoming a
     Covered  Officer), affirm in writing to the Board  that he has  received,
     read, and understands the Code (see  Exhibit  B);

   o Annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied  with the
     requirements of the Code; and

   o Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he
     knows of any violation of this Code.  Failure  to do so is  itself  is a
     violation of this Code.

     FT's  General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation./4/
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers5 sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

   o FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
     action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;

   o If, after such investigation, FT's General Counsel or Deputy  General
     Counsel  believes that no violation has occurred,  FT's General  Counsel is
     not required to take any further action;

   o Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes
     is a  violation  will be reported to the Independent Directors  of the
     appropriate FT Fund;

   o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred,  it
     will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the  appropriate
     Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may include review of,
     and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
     notification to appropriate  personnel of the investment adviser or its
     board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

   o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
     appropriate; and

   o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
     disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted  by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies there under. Insofar as other
policies or procedures  of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code.  The FT Code of Ethics and Policy  Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-l under the  Investment  Company Act and more
detailed policies and procedures set forth in FT's Employee Handbook are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority  vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.




- ---------------------

1. Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered  management  investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted  such a code of ethics,  it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant  must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet  website and
disclose,  in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet  website;  or (3)  undertake in
its most recent  report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person  without  charge,
upon  request,  a copy of the code and explain the manner in which such  request
may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or waivers (including
implicit  waivers)  from,  a provision  of the code in the  registrant's  annual
report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant intends to satisfy the
requirement to disclose  amendments  and waivers by posting such  information on
its  website,  it will be  required to disclose  its  Internet  address and this
intention.

2. Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships may be made separately
by completing  the Directors  and Officers  Questionnaire  and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel.

3. Any  activity or  relationship  that would  present a conflict  for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member
of the Covered  Officer's  immediate  family  engages in such an activity or has
such a  relationship.  The Cover Person should also obtain  written  approval by
FT's General Counsel in such situations.

4. FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult, as
appropriate,  with members of the Audit  Committee,  counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent  Directors,  and are encouraged to do so. 5 Item 2 of
Form N-CSR  defines  "waiver" as "the  approval by the  registrant of a material
departure  from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit  waiver," which
must also be  disclosed,  as "the  registrant's  failure to take action within a
reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the
code of  ethics  that  has  been  made  known to an  executive  officer"  of the
registrant.
