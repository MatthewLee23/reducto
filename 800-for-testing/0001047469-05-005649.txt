LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

                                                                February 2, 2005

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

For the year ended December 31, 2004, The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") had an
increase in its net asset value ("NAV"), assuming the reinvestment of dividends
and distributions, of 25.43% vs. an increase of 28.0% (with net dividends) for
the Morgan Stanley Capital International Chile Index*. Based on market price,
the Fund's shares rose 14.93% during the year ended December 31, 2004. As a
result, the Fund's discount to its NAV stood at 10.78% on December 31, 2004,
compared with a discount of 2.62% at the beginning of the year. Over the year,
the Fund's average discount to NAV was 10.37%.

In terms of noteworthy performance attribution, our position in Cencosud S.A.
(5.0% of the Fund's net assets as of December 31, 2004), a retailer, added
significantly to returns, and our avoidance of Distribucion y Servicio D&S S.A.
in the same sector was also positive. In the food and beverages sector, our
overweight position in wine maker Vina Concha y Toro S.A. (4.7% of the Fund's
net assets as of December 31, 2004) contributed to returns. In the
transportation sector, our positions in Lan Chile S.A. and Compania SudAmericana
de Vapores S.A. (0.0% and 4.8% of the Fund's net assets, respectively, as of
December 31, 2004) also contributed positively to performance. On the negative
side, almost all the relative underperformance is attributable to the absence of
steel company, CAP S.A., in the portfolio, which had a strong gain. Our
underweights in department stores Almacenes Paris S.A. and S.A.C.I. Falabella,
S.A. (0.0% and 3.4% of the Fund's net assets, respectively, as of December 31,
2004) also hurt performance, as did our underweight in electricity generator
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A. (10.1% of the Fund's net assets as of
December 31, 2004).

THE STOCK MARKET IN CHILE: INVESTOR SENTIMENT TURNS POSITIVE.

The global environment was broadly favorable for emerging markets. Ample
liquidity conditions as a result of low global interest rates, robust global
growth and high investor appetite for higher-return and higher-risk assets drove
outperformance versus developed markets for the year as a whole, notwithstanding
a mid-period downturn. Chile's stock market had a good showing in absolute and
relative terms for the 12 months, reflecting a strong second half of the year as
investors took note of the country's improving macroeconomic backdrop. In
addition to benefiting from high commodity prices and export revenues (for
copper in particular), domestic demand strengthened during the course of the
year.

Chile's Gross Domestic Product grew 5.7% in 2004, about a full percentage point
higher than what was generally expected as the year began. Although inflation is
still at historically low levels and below the Central Bank's 3% target rate,
this growth resulted in a building of inflationary pressures, prompting the
country's Central Bank to raise short-term interest rates in the latter part of
the year, ending a four year easing cycle. Higher rates, coupled with strong
export revenues, contributed to a rise in Chile's currency vs. the U.S. dollar.
The Chilean peso appreciated by 5.7% during 2004, averaging CLP609.55 to the
U.S. dollar. Sovereign debt yields also reflected the strengthening of Chile's
economy. The spread between Chile's sovereign debt and U.S. Treasuries narrowed
from 110 basis points in May to a low of 61 basis points in December 2004.

THE PORTFOLIO: STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT

The Fund paid a distribution of U.S. $1.87 per share, on January 7, 2005,
equivalent to 11.4% of the NAV at the time of the announcement, of which $1.47
per share was comprised of long-term capital gains. The majority of this
long-term capital gain distribution was related to the realization of a gain on
the sale of Compania de Telecomunicaciones de Chile S.A. (NYSE: CTC, 6.9% of the
Fund's net assets as of December 31, 2004), Chile's leading telecommunications
company. Earlier in 2004, CTC announced that it would sell its wireless division
to Telefonica de Espana and distribute the cash to CTC's shareholders. We opted
not to receive the cash, as it would have been taxed at a higher rate than the
prevailing capital gains tax in Chile. Instead, we sold the stock pre-dividend,
realizing a significant long-term gain, and purchased it back after the
ex-dividend date.

Our portfolio activity in the latter part of the period was mainly limited to
taking profits on stocks which have performed well, in order to raise cash for
the dividend distribution. For example, we reduced our exposure to Compania
SudAmericana de Vapores S.A., a shipping stock that had performed well, after we
purchased it in early 2004. A noteworthy recent purchase was adding to Enersis
S.A. (8.1% of the Fund's net assets as of December 31, 2004), an electricity
generation and distribution company with interests principally in Argentina,
Brazil and Chile that we think might benefit from both rising domestic demand as
well as demand in Brazil and Argentina.

Liquidity conditions have improved, with average daily traded volumes doubling
in the year. The market has also been active with respect to issuance, including
IPOs and issuance from existing companies. We purchased a significant stake in
retailer Cencosud S.A. early in the year as well as adding to our position in
Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A. (4.9% of the Fund's net assets as of December
31, 2004) as part of a large block trade later in the year.

Looking ahead, our outlook on Chile and its stock market remains generally
positive. The economy made significant progress in 2004, and we think it could
generate similar growth in 2005, driven primarily by expanding domestic
consumption; we believe that commodity prices are likely to remain firm in 2005
which could underpin key macroeconomic variables, including the current account
balance and the currency. Market liquidity, which was so supportive for most of
2004, may become a headwind in 2005 as interest rates rise to head off
inflation. The pension funds are unlikely to be as a significant source of
demand as they were in 2004.

Valuations, as has been the case in Chile for many years now, are stretched
relative to most emerging market countries, and are now at the top end of the
range relative to Chile's own trading range. However, as long as Chile can
maintain good economic performance, we believe that stocks in the country could
continue to enjoy premium valuations.

For our part, we will continue to look for reasonably valued companies we think
can deliver consistent earnings growth. From a sector perspective, we are
overweight in consumer areas such as beverages and specific retail stocks, as we
think the consumer will be a key driver of Chile's economy over the next several
years. We are also overweight in utilities, where we see good growth prospects
at reasonable valuations.

We continue to see the main risks as external: notably an upward spike in U.S.
interest rates or a hard landing in China. Both of these risks of course are
common to most emerging markets and Chile. Thanks to Chile's robust internal
capital markets and diversified trading patterns, it may be less exposed than
most. Our basic view is benign: that U.S.

                                        2
<Page>

rates rise only modestly as 2005 progresses and China's growth remains robust.
Domestic risks include the Presidential elections in November 2005. However, the
market has largely discounted a continuation of the ruling coalition government,
and we do not foresee major surprises. One negative development which we expect
to reemerge in the next government is the possibility of a new royalty tax on
mining; while we see such an event as a negative for mining companies, we think
it would have limited impact on investor sentiment toward Chile as a whole.

Respectfully,

/s/ Matthew J.K. Hickman

THE CHILE FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on January 30,
1989 and commenced investment operations on September 27, 1989. The Fund is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company.

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value of the Fund is determined daily as of
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"Exchange") on each day the Exchange is open for business. The Fund's equity
investments are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the
closing price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily
traded at the time of valuation (the "Valuation Time"). If no sales are
reported, equity investments are generally valued at the most recent bid
quotation as of the Valuation Time or at the lowest ask quotation in the case of
a short sale of securities. Debt securities with a remaining maturity greater
than 60 days are valued in accordance with the price supplied by a pricing
service, which may use a matrix, formula or other objective method that takes
into consideration market indices, yield curves and other specific adjustments.
Debt obligations that will mature in 60 days or less are valued on the basis of
amortized cost, which approximates market value, unless it is determined that
this method would not represent fair value.

Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available, or whose values have been materially affected by events occurring
before the Fund's Valuation Time, but after the close of the securities' primary
market, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the
direction of, the Board of Directors under procedures established by the Board
of Directors. The Fund may utilize a service provided by an independent third
party which has been approved by the Board of Directors to fair value certain
securities. At December 31, 2004, the Fund held 1.91% of its net assets in a
security valued at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures
established by the Board of Directors with an aggregate cost of $4,296,118 and
fair value of $3,044,513. The Fund's estimate of fair value assumes a willing
buyer and a willing seller neither acting under a compulsion to buy or sell.
Although this security may be resold in privately negotiated transactions, the
prices realized on such sales could differ from the price originally paid by the
Fund or the current carrying value, and the difference could be material.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT: The Fund sweeps available cash into a short-term deposit
issued by Bank of America N.A. The short-term time deposit is a variable rate
account classified as a short-term investment.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment transactions are
accounted for on a trade date basis. The cost of investments sold is determined
by use of the specific identification method for both financial reporting and
U.S. income tax purposes. Interest income is accrued as earned; dividend income
is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

TAXES: No provision is made for U.S. income or excise taxes as it is the Fund's
intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and to make
the requisite distributions to its shareholders sufficient to

                                       12
<Page>

relieve it from all or substantially all U.S. income and excise taxes.

The Fund accrues foreign taxes on realized gains and repatriation taxes in an
amount equal to what the Fund would owe if the securities were sold and the
proceeds repatriated on the valuation date as a liability and reduction of
realized/unrealized gains. Taxes on foreign income are recorded when the related
income is recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the Fund incurred
$335,617 of such expense.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS: The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

      (I) market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
          valuation date rate of exchange; and

     (II) purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at
          the relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of
          such transactions.

The Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses on investments in
equity securities which is due to changes in the foreign exchange rates from
that which is due to changes in market prices of equity securities. Accordingly,
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such
securities are included in the reported net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on investment transactions balances.

The Fund reports certain foreign currency related transactions and foreign taxes
withheld on security transactions as components of realized gains for financial
reporting purposes, whereas such foreign currency related transactions are
treated as ordinary income for U.S. income tax purposes.

Net unrealized currency gains or losses from valuing foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are reflected as
a component of net unrealized appreciation/depreciation in value of investments,
and translation of other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies.

Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses represent foreign exchange gains
and losses from transactions in foreign currencies and forward foreign currency
contracts, exchange gains or losses realized between the trade date and
settlement date on security transactions, and the difference between the amounts
of interest and dividends recorded on the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME AND GAINS: The Fund distributes at least annually to
shareholders substantially all of its net investment income and net realized
short-term capital gains, if any. The Fund determines annually whether to
distribute any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized
short-term capital losses, including capital loss carryovers, if any. An
additional distribution may be made to the extent necessary to avoid the payment
of a 4% U.S. federal excise tax. Dividends and distributions to shareholders are
recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.

The character of distributions made during the year from net investment income
or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for U.S.
income tax purposes due to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles/tax
differences in the character of income and expense recognition.

OTHER: The Fund may invest in securities of foreign countries and governments
which involve certain risks in addition to those inherent in domestic
investments. Such risks generally include, among others, currency risks
(fluctuations in currency exchange rates),

                                       13
<Page>

information risk (key information may be inaccurate or unavailable) and
political risk (expropriation, nationalization or the imposition of capital or
currency controls or punitive taxes). Other risks of investing in foreign
securities include liquidity and valuation risks.

Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

The Chilean securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more
volatile than the major securities markets in the United States. Consequently,
acquisition and disposition of securities by the Fund may be inhibited. A
significant proportion of the aggregate market value of equity securities listed
on the Santiago Exchange are held by a small number of investors and are not
publicly traded. This may limit the number of shares available for acquisition
or disposition by the Fund.

Investments in Chile may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated with investments in the United States, including the possibility of
future political and economic developments and the level of Chilean governmental
supervision and regulation of its securities markets.

The Fund, subject to local investment limitations, may invest up to 20% of its
assets (at the time of commitment) in illiquid equity securities, including
securities of private equity funds (whether in corporate or partnership form)
that invest primarily in the emerging markets. When investing through another
investment fund, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses
incurred by that fund, including management fees. Such securities are expected
to be illiquid, which may involve a high degree of business and financial risk
and may result in substantial losses. Because of the current absence of any
liquid trading market for these investments, the Fund may take longer to
liquidate these positions than would be the case for publicly traded securities.
Although these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions,
the prices realized on such sales could be substantially less than those
originally paid by the Fund or the current carrying values and these difference
could be material. Further, companies whose securities are not publicly traded
may not be subject to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements
applicable to companies whose securities are publicly traded.

Company as operations agent for temporary or emergency purposes. Under the terms
of the Credit Facility, the Participating Funds pay an aggregate commitment fee
at a rate of 0.10% per annum on the average unused amount of the Credit
Facility, which is allocated among the Participating Funds in such manner as is
determined by the governing Boards of the Participating Funds. In addition, the
Participating Funds pay interest on borrowings at the Federal Funds rate plus
0.50%. The maximum amount outstanding under the Credit Facility for the Fund was
$2,700,000 with an average daily balance of $22,449 and an average daily
interest rate of 1.50% during the year ended December 31, 2004. The Fund had no
borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2004.

NOTE F. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions and
losses deferred due to wash sales.

                                       15

The tax character of dividends and distributions paid during the years ended
December 31, for the Fund were as follows:

At December 31, 2004, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis,
for the Fund were as follows:

<Table>
<S>                                        <C>
Undistributed ordinary income              $  1,474,158
Accumulated net realized gain                11,277,994
Unrealized appreciation                      65,182,772
                                           ------------
Total distributable earnings               $ 77,934,924
                                           ============
</Table>

At December 31, 2004, the identified cost for federal income tax purposes, as
well as the gross unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost, gross unrealized depreciation from
investments for those securities having an excess of cost over value and the net
unrealized appreciation from investments were $104,491,149, $66,454,356,
$(1,279,865) and $65,174,491, respectively.

At December 31, 2004, the Fund reclassified from accumulated net realized gain
on investments and foreign currency related transactions of $11,725 to
undistributed net investment income. Net assets were not affected by this
reclassification.

NOTE G. CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Fund may provide general indemnifications
pursuant to certain contracts and organizational documents. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is dependent on future claims that may be made
against the Fund and, therefore, cannot be estimated; however, based on
experience, the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of The Chile Fund, Inc.:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations, of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
at December 31, 2004, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,
and the financial highlights for each of the ten years in the period then ended,
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at
December 31, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and issuers, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

                                       18

TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

The Fund is required by Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, to advise its shareholders within 60 days of the Fund's year end
(December 31, 2004) as to the U.S. federal tax status of dividends and
distributions received by the Fund's shareholders in respect of such year. Of
the $2.23 per share distribution paid in respect of such year, $0.47 per share
was derived from net investment income and $1.76 per share was derived from net
realized long-term capital gains. The Fund has met the requirements to pass
through all ordinary income as qualified dividends as noted on Box 1B on Form
1099-DIV. Please note that to utilize the lower tax rate for qualifying dividend
income, shareholders must have held their shares in the Fund for at least 61
days during the 121 day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date.
There were no distributions which qualified for the dividend received deduction
available to corporate shareholders.

The Fund does not intend to make an election under Section 853 to pass through
foreign taxes paid by the Fund to its shareholders. This information is given to
meet certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
Shareholders should refer to their Form1099-DIV to determine the amount
includable on their respective tax returns for 2004.

Notification for calendar year 2004 was mailed in January 2005. The notification
along with Form 1099-DIV reflects the amount to be used by calendar year
taxpayers on their U.S. federal income tax returns.

Foreign shareholders will generally be subject to U.S. withholding tax on the
amount of the actual ordinary dividends paid by the Fund. They will generally
not be entitled to foreign tax credit or deduction for the withholding taxes
paid by the Fund.

In general, distributions received by tax-exempt recipients (e.g., IRAs and
Keoghs) need not be reported as taxable income for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. However, some retirement trusts (e.g., corporate, Keogh and 403(b)(7)
plans) may need this information for their annual information reporting.

Shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the
tax consequences of their investment in the Fund.

DESCRIPTION OF INVESTLINK(SM) PROGRAM (UNAUDITED)

The InvestLink(SM) Program is sponsored and administered by EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A., with EquiServe, Inc. acting as service agent to the
aforementioned and, not by The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"). EquiServe Trust
Company, N.A., will act as program administrator (the "Program Administrator")
of the InvestLink(SM) Program (the "Program"). The purpose of the Program is to
provide existing shareholders with a simple and convenient way to invest
additional funds and reinvest dividends in shares of the Fund's common stock
("Shares") at prevailing prices, with reduced brokerage commissions and fees.

In order to participate in the Program, you must be a registered holder of at
least one Share of stock of the Fund. Purchases of Shares with funds from a
participant's cash payment or automatic account deduction will begin on the next
day on which funds are invested. All cash payments must be drawn on a U.S. bank
and payable in U.S. dollars. Checks must be made payable to EquiServe. If a
participant selects the dividend reinvestment option, automatic investment of
dividends generally will begin with the next dividend payable after the Program
Administrator receives his enrollment form. Once in the Program, a person will
remain a participant until he terminates his participation or sells all Shares
held in his Program account, or his account is terminated by the Program
Administrator. A participant may change his investment options at any time by
requesting a new enrollment form and returning it to the Program Administrator.

A participant will be assessed certain charges in connection with his
participation in the Program. All optional cash deposit investments will be
subject to a service charge. Sales processed through the Program will have a
service fee deducted from the net proceeds, after brokerage commissions. In
addition to the transaction charges outlined above, participants will be
assessed per share processing fees (which include brokerage commissions.)
Participants will not be charged any fee for reinvesting dividends. The number
of Shares to be purchased for a participant depends on the amount of his
dividends, cash payments or bank account or payroll deductions, less applicable
fees and commissions, and the purchase price of the Shares. The investment date
for cash payments is the 25th day of each month (or the next trading day if the
25th is not a trading day). The investment date for dividend reinvestment is the
dividend payment date. The Program Administrator uses dividends and funds of
participants to purchase Shares of the Fund in the open market. Such purchases
will be made by participating brokers as agent for the participants using normal
cash settlement practices. All Shares purchased through the Program will be
allocated to participants as of the settlement date, which is usually three
business days from the purchase date. In all cases, transaction processing will
occur within 30 days of the receipt of funds, except where temporary curtailment
or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with applicable provisions of
the Federal Securities laws or when unusual market conditions make prudent
investment impracticable. In the event the Program Administrator is unable to
purchase Shares within 30 days of the receipt of funds, such funds will be
returned to the participants.

The average price of all Shares purchased by the Program Administrator with all
funds received during the time period from two business days preceding any
investment date up to the second business day preceding the next investment date
shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in connection with the
Shares purchased for his account with his funds or dividends received by the
Program Administrator during such time period. The average price of all Shares
sold by the Program Administrator pursuant to sell orders received during such
time period shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in
connection with the Shares sold for his account pursuant to his sell orders
received by the Program Administrator during such time period. All sale requests
having an

                                       20
<Page>

anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are expected to be submitted in
written form. In addition, all sale requests received by the Program
Administrator within thirty (30) days of an address change are expected to be
submitted in written form.

EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., as Program Administrator, administers the Program
for participants, keeps records, sends statements of account to participants and
performs other duties relating to the Program. Each participant in the Program
will receive a statement of his account following each purchase of Shares. The
statements will also show the amount of dividends credited to such participant's
account (if applicable), as well as the fees paid by the participant. In
addition, each participant will receive copies of the Fund's annual and
semi-annual reports to shareholders, proxy statements and, if applicable,
dividend income information for tax reporting purposes.

If the Fund is paying dividends on the Shares, a participant will receive
dividends through the Program for all Shares held on the dividend record date on
the basis of full and fractional Shares held in his account, and for all other
Shares of the Fund registered in his name. The Program Administrator will send
checks to the participants for the amounts of their dividends that are not to be
automatically reinvested at no cost to the participants.

Shares of the Fund purchased under the Program will be registered in the name of
the accounts of the respective participants. Unless requested, the Fund will not
issue to participants certificates for Shares of the Fund purchased under the
Program. The Program Administrator will hold the Shares in book-entry form until
a Program participant chooses to withdraw his Shares or terminate his
participation in the Program. The number of Shares purchased for a participant's
account under the Program will be shown on his statement of account. This
feature protects against loss, theft or destruction of stock certificates.

A participant may withdraw all or a portion of the Shares from his Program
account by notifying the Program Administrator. After receipt of a participant's
request, the Program Administrator will issue to such participant certificates
for the whole Shares of the Fund so withdrawn or, if requested by the
participant, sell the Shares for him and send him the proceeds, less applicable
brokerage commissions, fees, and transfer taxes, if any. If a participant
withdraws all full and fractional Shares in his Program account, his
participation in the Program will be terminated by the Program Administrator. In
no case will certificates for fractional Shares be issued. The Program
Administrator will convert any fractional Shares held by a participant at the
time of his withdrawal to cash.

Participation in any rights offering, dividend distribution or stock split will
be based upon both the Shares of the Fund registered in participants' names and
the Shares (including fractional Shares) credited to participants' Program
accounts. Any stock dividend or Shares resulting from stock splits with respect
to Shares of the Fund, both full and fractional, which participants hold in
their Program accounts and with respect to all Shares registered in their names
will be automatically credited to their accounts.

All Shares of the Fund (including any fractional share) credited to his account
under the Program will be voted as the participant directs. The participants
will be sent the proxy materials for the annual meetings of shareholders. When a
participant returns an executed proxy, all of such Shares will be voted as
indicated. A participant may also elect to vote his Shares in person at the
Shareholders' meeting.

A participant will receive tax information annually for his personal records and
to help him prepare his U.S. federal income tax return. The automatic
reinvestment of dividends does not relieve him of any income tax which may be
payable on dividends. For further

                                       21
<Page>

information as to tax consequences of participation in the Program, participants
should consult with their own tax advisors.

The Program Administrator in administering the Program will not be liable for
any act done in good faith or for any good faith omission to act. However, the
Program Administrator will be liable for loss or damage due to error caused by
its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Shares held in custody by the
Program Administrator are not subject to protection under the Securities
Investors Protection Act of 1970.

The participant should recognize that neither the Fund nor the Program
Administrator can provide any assurance of a profit or protection against loss
on any Shares purchased under the Program. A participant's investment in Shares
held in his Program account is no different than his investment in directly held
Shares in this regard. The participant bears the risk of loss and the benefits
of gain from market price changes with respect to all of his Shares. Neither the
Fund nor the Program Administrator can guarantee that Shares purchased under the
Program will, at any particular time, be worth more or less than their purchase
price. Each participant must make an independent investment decision based on
his own judgment and research.

While the Program Administrator hopes to continue the Program indefinitely, the
Program Administrator reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Program at
any time. It also reserves the right to make modifications to the Program.
Participants will be notified of any such suspension, termination or
modification in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Program. The
Program Administrator also reserves the right to terminate any participant's
participation in the Program at any time. Any question of interpretation arising
under the Program will be determined in good faith by the Program Administrator
and any such good faith determination will be final.

Any interested shareholder may participate in the Program. All other cash
payments or bank account deductions must be at least $100.00, up to a maximum of
$100,000.00 annually. An interested shareholder may join the Program by reading
the Program description, completing and signing the enrollment form and
returning it to the Program Administrator. The enrollment form and information
relating to the Program (including the terms and conditions) may be obtained by
calling the Program Administrator at one of the following telephone numbers:

                       CREDIT SUISSE ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC

                               CREDIT SUISSE FUNDS

                        CREDIT SUISSE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS

                              CSAM CLOSED-END FUNDS

                       PROXY VOTING POLICY AND PROCEDURES

Introduction

     Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("CSAM") is a fiduciary that owes each
     of its clients duties of care and loyalty with respect to proxy voting. The
     duty of care requires CSAM to monitor corporate events and to vote proxies.
     To satisfy its duty of loyalty, CSAM must cast proxy votes in the best
     interests of each of its clients.

     The Credit Suisse Funds, Credit Suisse Institutional Funds, and CSAM
     Closed-End Funds (the "Funds"), which have engaged Credit Suisse Asset
     Management, LLC as their investment adviser, are of the belief that the
     proxy voting process is a means of addressing corporate governance issues
     and encouraging corporate actions both of which can enhance shareholder
     value.

Policy

     The Proxy Voting Policy (the "Policy") set forth below is designed to
     ensure that proxies are voted in the best interests of CSAM's clients. The
     Policy addresses particular issues and gives a general indication of how
     CSAM will vote proxies. The Policy is not exhaustive and does not include
     all potential issues.

Proxy Voting Committee

     The Proxy Voting Committee will consist of a member of the Portfolio
     Management Department, a member of the Legal and Compliance Department, and
     a member of the Operations Department (or their designees). The purpose of
     the Proxy Voting Committee is to administer the voting of all clients'
     proxies in accordance with the Policy. The Proxy Voting Committee will
     review the Policy annually to ensure that it is designed to promote the
     best interests of CSAM's clients.

     For the reasons disclosed below under "Conflicts," the Proxy Voting
     Committee has engaged the services of an independent third party
     (initially, Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS")) to assist in issue
     analysis and vote recommendation for proxy proposals. Proxy proposals
     addressed by the Policy will be voted in accordance with the Policy. Proxy
     proposals addressed by the Policy that require a case-by-case analysis will
     be voted in accordance with the vote

                                        5
<Page>

     recommendation of ISS. Proxy proposals not addressed by the Policy will
     also be voted in accordance with the vote recommendation of ISS. To the
     extent that the Proxy Voting Committee proposes to deviate from the Policy
     or the ISS vote recommendation, the Committee shall obtain client consent
     as described below.

     CSAM investment professionals may submit a written recommendation to the
     Proxy Voting Committee to vote in a manner inconsistent with the Policy
     and/or the recommendation of ISS. Such recommendation will set forth its
     basis and rationale. In addition, the investment professional must confirm
     in writing that he/she is not aware of any conflicts of interest concerning
     the proxy matter or provide a full and complete description of the
     conflict.

Conflicts

     CSAM is the institutional and mutual fund asset management arm of Credit
     Suisse First Boston, which is part of Credit Suisse Group, one of the
     world's largest financial organizations. As part of a global, full service
     investment-bank, broker-dealer, and asset-management organization, CSAM and
     its affiliates and personnel may have multiple advisory, transactional,
     financial, and other interests in securities, instruments, and companies
     that may be purchased or sold by CSAM for its clients' accounts. The
     interests of CSAM and/or its affiliates and personnel may conflict with the
     interests of CSAM's clients in connection with any proxy issue. In
     addition, CSAM may not be able to identify all of the conflicts of interest
     relating to any proxy matter.

Consent

     In each and every instance in which the Proxy Voting Committee favors
     voting in a manner that is inconsistent with the Policy or the vote
     recommendation of ISS (including proxy proposals addressed and not
     addressed by the Policy), it shall disclose to the client conflicts of
     interest information and obtain client consent to vote. Where the client is
     a Fund, disclosure shall be made to any one director who is not an
     "interested person," as that term is defined under the Investment Company
     Act of 1940, as amended, of the Fund.

Recordkeeping

CSAM is required to maintain in an easily accessible place for five years all
records relating to proxy voting.

     These records include the following:

     -    a copy of the Policy;

     -    a copy of each proxy statement received on behalf of CSAM clients;

                                        6
<Page>

     -    a record of each vote cast on behalf of CSAM clients;

     -    a copy of all documents created by CSAM personnel that were material
          to making a decision on a vote or that memorializes the basis for the
          decision; and

     -    a copy of each written request by a client for information on how CSAM

EXHIBIT 12(a)(1)

CODE OF ETHICS

                               CREDIT SUISSE FUNDS

                        CREDIT SUISSE INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS

                         CREDIT SUISSE CLOSED-END FUNDS

                       CODE OF ETHICS FOR SENIOR OFFICERS

PREAMBLE

          Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 directs that rules be
adopted disclosing whether a company has a code of ethics for senior financial
officers. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has adopted rules
requiring annual disclosure of an investment company's code of ethics applicable
to the company's principal executive as well as principal financial officers, if
such a code has been adopted. In response, the above Funds (each a "Fund", and
together the "Funds") have adopted this Code of Ethics.

STATEMENT OF POLICY

          It is the obligation of the senior officers of the Funds to provide
full, fair, timely and comprehensible disclosure--financial and otherwise--to
Fund shareholders, regulatory authorities and the general public. In fulfilling
that obligation, senior officers must act ethically, honestly and diligently.
This Code is intended to enunciate guidelines to be followed by persons who
serve the Funds in senior officerships. No Code can address every situation that
a senior officer might face; however, as a guiding principle, senior officers
should strive to implement the spirit as well as the

                                        1
<Page>

letter of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and to provide the type of
clear and complete disclosure and information Fund shareholders have a right to
expect.

          The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to promote high standards of
ethical conduct by Covered Persons (as defined below) in their capacities as
officers of the Funds, to instruct them as to what is considered to be
inappropriate and unacceptable conduct or activities for officers and to
prohibit such conduct or activities. This Code supplements other policies that
the Funds and their adviser have adopted or may adopt in the future with which
Fund officers are also required to comply (e.g., code of ethics relating to
personal trading and conduct).

COVERED PERSONS

          This Code of Ethics applies to those persons appointed by the Fund's
Board of Directors as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, or persons performing similar functions.
It is recognized that each of such persons currently is a full-time employee of
Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC ("CSAM"), each Fund's investment adviser.

PROMOTION OF HONEST AND ETHICAL CONDUCT

          In serving as an officer of the Funds, each Covered Person must
maintain high standards of honesty and ethical conduct and must encourage his
colleagues who provide services to the Funds, whether directly or indirectly, to
do the same.

          Each Covered Person understands that as an officer of a Fund, he has a
duty to act in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. The
interests of other CSAM clients or CSAM itself or the Covered Person's personal
interests should not be allowed to compromise the Covered

                                        2
<Page>

Person's fulfilling his duties as an officer of the Fund. The governing Boards
of the Funds recognize that the Covered Persons are also officers or employees
of CSAM. Furthermore, the governing Boards of the Funds recognize that, subject
to the Covered Person's fiduciary duties to the Funds, the Covered Persons will
in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the Funds or for
CSAM, or for both) be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on CSAM and the Funds. The governing
Boards of the Funds recognize that the participation of the Covered Persons in
such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between the Funds
and CSAM and/or its affiliates, and is consistent with the expectation of the
governing Boards of the performance by the Covered Persons of their duties as
officers of the Funds.

          If a Covered Person believes that his responsibilities as an officer
or employee of CSAM are likely to materially compromise his objectivity or his
ability to perform the duties of his role as an officer of the Funds, he should
consult with CSAM's general counsel, the Funds' chief legal officer or outside
counsel, or counsel to the independent Directors/Trustees of the relevant Fund
or Funds. Under appropriate circumstances, a Covered Person should also consider
whether to present the matter to the Directors/Trustees of the relevant Fund or
Funds or a committee thereof.

          No Covered Person shall suggest that any person providing, or
soliciting to be retained to provide, services to a Fund give a gift or an
economic benefit of any kind to him in connection with the person's retention or
the provision of services.

PROMOTION OF FULL, FAIR, ACCURATE, TIMELY AND UNDERSTANDABLE DISCLOSURE

          No Covered Person shall create or further the creation of false or
misleading information in any SEC filing or report to Fund shareholders. No
Covered Person shall conceal or fail

                                        3
<Page>

to disclose information within the Covered Person's possession legally required
to be disclosed or necessary to make the disclosure made not misleading. If a
Covered Person shall become aware that information filed with the SEC or made
available to the public contains any false or misleading information or omits to
disclose necessary information, he shall promptly report it to CSAM's general
counsel or Fund counsel, who shall advise such Covered Person whether corrective
action is necessary or appropriate.

          Each Covered Person, consistent with his responsibilities, shall
exercise appropriate supervision over, and shall assist, relevant Fund service
providers in developing financial information and other disclosure that complies
with relevant law and presents information in a clear, comprehensible and
complete manner. Each Covered Person shall use his best efforts within his area
of expertise to assure that Fund reports reveal, rather than conceal, the
relevant Fund's financial condition.

          Each Covered Person shall seek to obtain additional resources if he
believes that available resources are inadequate to enable the Funds to provide
full, fair and accurate financial information and other disclosure to regulators
and Fund shareholders.

          Each Covered Person shall inquire of other Fund officers and service
providers, as appropriate, to assure that information provided is accurate and
complete and presented in an understandable format using comprehensible
language.

          Each Covered Person shall diligently perform his services to the
Funds, so that information can be gathered and assessed early enough to
facilitate timely filings and issuance of reports and required certifications.

                                        4
<Page>

PROMOTION OF COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE GOVERNMENT LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

          Each Covered Person shall become and remain knowledgeable concerning
the laws and regulations relating to the Funds and their operations and shall
act with competence and due care in serving as an officer of the Funds. Each
Covered Person with specific responsibility for financial statement disclosure
will become and remain knowledgeable concerning relevant auditing standards,
generally accepted accounting principles, FASB pronouncements and other
accounting and tax literature and developments.

          Each Covered Person shall devote sufficient time to fulfilling his
responsibilities to the Funds, recognizing that he will devote substantial time
to providing services to other CSAM clients and will perform other activities as
an employee of CSAM.

          Each Covered Person shall cooperate with a Fund's independent
auditors, regulatory agencies and internal auditors in their review or
inspection of the Fund and its operations.

          No Covered Person shall knowingly violate any law or regulation
relating to the Funds or their operations or seek to illegally circumvent any
such law or regulation.

          No Covered Person shall engage in any conduct involving dishonesty,
fraud, deceit or misrepresentation involving the Funds or their operations.

PROMOTING PROMPT INTERNAL REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS

          Each Covered Person shall promptly report his own violations of this
Code and violations by other Covered Persons of which he is aware to the
Chairman of the relevant Fund's Audit Committee.

                                        5
<Page>

          Any requests for a waiver from or an amendment to this Code shall be
made to the Chairman of the relevant Fund's Audit Committee. All waivers and
amendments shall be disclosed as required by law.

SANCTIONS

          Failure to comply with this Code will subject the violator to
appropriate sanctions, which will vary based on the nature and severity of the
violation. Such sanctions may include censure, suspension or termination of
position as an officer of the Fund. Sanctions shall be imposed by the relevant
Fund's Audit Committee, subject to review by the entire Board of
Directors/Trustees of the Fund.

          Each Covered Person shall be required to certify annually whether he
has complied with this Code.

NO RIGHTS CREATED

          This Code of Ethics is a statement of certain fundamental principles,
policies and procedures that govern the Funds' senior officers in the conduct of
the Funds' business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights in any
employee, investor, supplier, competitor, shareholder or any other person or
entity.

RECORDKEEPING

          The Funds will maintain and preserve for a period of not less than six
(6) years from the date such action is taken, the first two (2) years in an
easily accessible place, a copy of the information or materials supplied to the
Board (1) that provided the basis for any amendment or

                                        6
<Page>

waiver to this Code and (2) relating to any violation of the Code and sanctions
imposed for such violation, together with a written record of the approval or
action taken by the relevant Board.

AMENDMENTS

          The Directors/Trustees will make and approve such changes to this Code
of Ethics as they deem necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of
this Code.
