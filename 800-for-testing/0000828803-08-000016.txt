                          GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                                 Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                                 structure combines the specialized expertise of
                                 three world-class investment management
                                 groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE            Each of our portfolio management groups
                                 operates autonomously, relying on its own
                                 research and staying true to the unique
                                 investment disciplines that underlie its
                                 success.

                                 FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                                 recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                                 also brings expertise in growth- and
                                 value-style U.S. equity investing.

                                 TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                                 international investing and, in 1954, launched
                                 what has become the industry's oldest global
                                 fund. Today, with offices in over 25 countries,
                                 Templeton offers investors a truly global
                                 perspective.

                                 MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series
                                 is dedicated to a unique style of value
                                 investing, searching aggressively for
                                 opportunity among what it believes are
                                 undervalued stocks, as well as arbitrage
                                 situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION             Because our management groups work
                                 independently and adhere to different
                                 investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and
                                 Mutual Series funds typically have distinct
                                 portfolios. That's why our funds can be used to
                                 build truly diversified allocation plans
                                 covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST        At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                                 consistently provide investors with exceptional
                                 risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as
                                 well as the reliable, accurate and personal
                                 service that has helped us become one of the
                                 most trusted names in financial services.

A Message from Gregory E. Johnson,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Franklin Resources, Inc.

                                                                October 12, 2008

Dear Shareholder:

The enclosed annual report for Templeton Global Income Fund covers the 12 months
ended August 31, 2008, but I would like to add some comments on market events
that occurred in September and early October. Recent market volatility has been
jarring to everyone, including those of us who have worked in financial markets
for many years. Bank lending around the world has seized up, and the fallout has
impacted venerable firms alongside broader stock and bond indexes.

This environment is bound to provoke great concern, but it's equally important
to put the latest market developments in perspective. That's why I'd like to
offer a few thoughts on these events, our company's approach to investing and
the strong health of our organization.

A key point to recognize is that global financial turmoil is being addressed by
global action. Central banks around the world have coordinated their efforts to
cut interest rates and supply liquidity to frozen funding markets. A number of
governments have also intervened to rescue major financial institutions or find
an orderly way for them to be acquired. Here in the U.S., the Federal Reserve
and Treasury Department have moved rapidly to establish new programs for easing
money-market pressures and handling troubled financial assets. The outcome of
all of these efforts may take a while to be realized, but I believe that the
latest actions here and abroad mark a significant turning point.

It's also important to remember that as daunting as current market conditions
may be, we have navigated through other periods of market volatility. U.S. stock
markets recorded three bear markets during the 1960s as the nation grappled with
the Vietnam War and a turbulent economy.(1) The quintupling of oil prices in
1973 led to a deep U.S. recession and a stock market plunge of 45.1% from
January 1973 through December 1974.(1) And the "Black Monday" stock market crash
of 1987 remains the largest single day percentage decline in the history of the
Dow Jones Industrial Average.(2)


Advice applicable throughout these upheavals remains true today. The late Sir
John Templeton, writing 15 years ago, ended a list of his core investment
principles with these thoughts: "Do not be fearful or negative too often. . . .
For 100 years optimists have carried the day in U.S. stocks. Even in the dark
'70s, many professional money managers -- and many individual investors too --
made money in stocks . . . . In this century or the next it's still 'Buy low,
sell high.'"(3)

Sir John knew that these simple concepts were difficult to execute in the face
of pessimism. Nonetheless, that is precisely how our Franklin, Templeton and
Mutual Series portfolio managers are contending with today's challenging
environment. They are using their expertise to sort through investment
opportunities, avoiding those firms that have become merely cheap and
identifying those firms best positioned to be eventual winners. This kind of
rigorous, bottom-up, security-by-security analysis is the fundamental investment
discipline practiced across our global platform.

These asset management strengths are also the core of our business. Unlike
financial firms that have dominated recent headlines, Franklin Templeton derives
its revenue primarily from investment management, not investment banking or
securities brokerage. Additionally, our assets under management are diversified
by fund objective, investment clientele, management brand and geographic region.
Diversified positioning helps our firm maintain healthy operating margins even
when volatile markets reduce assets under management. It is also important to
note that maintaining a strong balance sheet has been a pillar of our management
strategy. We have a substantial pool of cash and investments and low levels of
debt, and we are in the enviable position of

not having to depend on credit to meet our operating needs. In fact, our strong
franchise, sound capitalization and minimal leverage led Standard & Poor's to
recently raise its credit ratings on Franklin Resources, Inc. (BEN) to the
highest level currently applied to a publicly traded asset manager.(4)

Franklin Templeton's six-decade growth into a premier global asset manager has
given us the conviction that although conditions on the ground remain
challenging, there are ample reasons to be optimistic about eventual market
stabilization and recovery. Being able to take advantage of markets shaken by
maximum pessimism has helped our firm develop into an organization that
stretches across 29 countries and manages assets for more than 20 million
shareholder accounts.

In the enclosed annual report for Templeton Global Income Fund, the portfolio
manager discusses market conditions, investment decisions and Fund performance
during the 12 months ended August 31, 2008. The report contains additional
performance data and financial information. Our website, FRANKLINTEMPLETON.COM,

advisor, who can review your overall portfolio, reassess your goals and help you

markets fluctuate, as do fund share prices.

We are grateful for the trust you have placed in Franklin Templeton and remain
focused on serving your investment needs.

Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to bring you Templeton Global Income Fund's annual report for the
fiscal year ended August 31, 2008.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the 12 months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund posted cumulative
total returns of +12.25% based on market price and +10.68% based on net asset
value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond Index
(GGBI), which posted cumulative total returns of +4.87% in local currency terms
and +1.10% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period.(1) You can find the Fund's
long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 10.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

During the Fund's fiscal year, the global economy faced several economic shocks
including a U.S. housing market correction that spread globally, a commodity
price upsurge and a credit crunch. Given the diverse nature of these shocks,
global bond and currency markets experienced considerable volatility over the
12-month period. With multiple headwinds to growth, the global economy began to
slow, led by the U.S. and later followed by Europe and other industrialized
countries. Global inflation rates rose sharply as food and energy prices soared
but began to moderate toward period-end as commodity prices softened and global
growth waned.

U.S. economic growth remained sluggish due to continued weakness in the housing
market and lower confidence among households and businesses. In second quarter
2008, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth registered 2.1% compared with
second quarter 2007 (year-over-year). Continued demand weakness helped
moderately reduce the U.S.'s large current account deficit. Additionally, the
U.S. dollar's more than 30% decline versus major trading partners from 2001
through 2007 increased the competitiveness of U.S. producers, leading to a
recovery in exports.(2) However, rising U.S. mortgage delinquencies triggered a
period of significant risk reduction in the banking sector and financial
markets. Deterioration in asset quality and capital positions of major U.S.
financial institutions led to further distress in credit markets, which prompted
U.S. policy makers to provide liquidity measures to avert a system-wide
meltdown. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board (Fed) also reduced interest rates a
cumulative 325 basis points (bps) from 5.25% to 2.00% during the reporting
period.

European economic growth came under increased pressure and eurozone second
quarter 2008 GDP growth slowed to 1.4% year-over-year.(3) However, the European
Central Bank (ECB) increased interest rates 25 bps to 4.25% in July due to
concerns that the significant commodity price-based inflation increase would
influence households' expectations of future price developments and wage
demands. Consumer price inflation surged to 3.8%, or nearly twice the rate the
ECB defines as consistent with price stability.(3) While European labor markets
remained stable, consumer confidence dropped sharply because of higher inflation
and a less favorable economic outlook. Headwinds to growth continued to build,
including pockets of housing market weakness, the effects of past interest rate
tightening, the impact to European exporters of slowing global growth, and the
euro's rapid strengthening throughout most of the reporting period. Non-euro
European countries, excluding the U.K., continued to tighten interest rates as
these nations' inflation rates deviated from their central banks' targets. For
example, Poland hiked interest rates 125 bps and Norway and Sweden raised them
100 bps.

Asia's economic growth also moderated, but not to the extent seen in the U.S. or
Europe. China's second quarter GDP registered 10.1% year-over-year growth,
although that was below 2007's 12.0% average quarterly rate.(4)

country's international transactions in goods and services are recorded.

WHAT IS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?

Balance of payments is a record of all of a country's exports and imports of
goods and services, borrowing and lending with the rest of the world during a
particular time period. It helps a country evaluate its competitive strengths
and weaknesses and forecast the strength of its currency.

Outside of China, economic growth was more modest. In second quarter 2008,
Indonesia's economy grew 6.4%, Malaysia's 6.3%, South Korea's 4.8% and Japan's
0.7%.(5) Asia also experienced rising inflation as food and energy prices
surged. With oil reaching a peak price level of $145 per barrel, some Asian
governments reduced the amount of their energy subsidies. However, Asian
interest rates generally did not tighten as significantly as in Europe or Latin
America. During the 12-month period, Indonesia hiked interest rates 75 bps,
China 45 bps and South Korea 25 bps. By period-end, however, China began
relaxing restrictions on lending and discussed strategies for supporting
investment growth through government spending. Asia broadly continued to
generate trade and current account surpluses, with the exception of South Korea.
Singapore registered a current account surplus of 18.7% of GDP, Malaysia 16.5%,
China 11.0% and Indonesia 2.3%.(4, 6) South Korea, on the other hand,
experienced a 0.8% deficit.(7)

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency
exchange rates and credit risks.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

The Fund's positioning during the year under review reflected our analysis that
given trade and financial linkages, global economic growth could slow due to
weak U.S. demand and continued financial and credit market stresses. Although
global inflation rates generally increased during the reporting period, we
increased our exposure to bond markets where we identified certain
characteristics. These included countries with inflation resulting from a supply
shock from commodity prices rather than driven by domestic demand, central banks
that demonstrated credibility and, in our view, prospects for weaker economic
growth. We believed market volatility could present attractive buying
opportunities because these markets' central banks would be well positioned to
reduce interest rates if the supply shock fades.

Compared with the JPM GGBI, our interest rate positioning detracted from
relative performance. Developed markets' long-term bond yields fell at the onset
of the credit crisis a year ago. For example, significant monetary easing and
flight to quality benefited U.S. long-term Treasury yields, which fell 71 bps
during the 12-month period to 3.83% on August 31, 2008. As a result, our
underweighted positioning in developed markets, including the U.S., worked
against the Fund's relative performance. On the other hand, emerging bond market
yields rose due mostly to risk aversion. Thus, the Fund's key duration positions
including Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea negatively impacted relative
performance. Nevertheless, we saw value in these markets whose yields were
attractive relative to U.S. Treasuries and have lagged the U.S.'s rally. For
example, Mexico's long-term bond yields rose 64 bps to 8.44% at period-end.(8
)Mexico's central bank fought to keep rising food prices from boosting inflation
expectations by hiking interest rates 100 bps during the period. However,
Mexico's economic growth faced increased uncertainty given that the nation has
strong economic links to the weakening U.S. economy.

CURRENCY STRATEGY

Sluggish domestic economic growth, concerns over spreading financial sector
weakness, and Fed interest rate cuts led to the U.S. dollar's decline during the
12-month period. The dollar fell 7.40% against the euro and 6.38% against the
Japanese yen.(9) Countries with strong balance of payment fundamentals and large
commodity exports also benefited. For instance, the Brazilian real gained 20.05%
versus the U.S. dollar, which boosted Fund performance.(9)

During the reporting period, we favored exposure to the Japanese yen and Swiss
franc, which we believed could benefit from global deleveraging. Additionally,
given their positive correlation to increasing risk aversion, we believed these
currencies may help minimize Fund volatility. The Fund's relative performance
gained from exposure to the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen during the period.

We increasingly positioned the Fund during the period under review toward Asia,
where we perceived greater relative value than in Europe. This was largely based
on our outlook for a more moderate economic growth slowdown in Asia compared
with Europe and the U.S., and our assessment that the euro was significantly
overvalued and Asian currencies broadly undervalued. Additionally, we remained
cautious with regard to the U.S. dollar versus Asian

WHAT IS DURATION?

Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes. In
general, a portfolio of securities with a lower duration can be expected to be
less sensitive to interest rate changes than a portfolio with a higher duration.

currencies given the U.S.'s large bilateral trade deficit with Asia, which at
$352 billion is more than three times the deficit the U.S. has with Europe.(5)
Over the past seven years, the euro appreciated 62% against the U.S. dollar
while the Chinese yuan appreciated 21%.(9) In addition to our Japanese yen
allocation, we continued to hold exposure to a basket of Asian currencies
including the Singapore dollar and Malaysian ringgit. The Fund benefited from
the 7.75% and 3.18% appreciation of the Singapore dollar and Malaysian ringgit
against the U.S. dollar during the 12-month period.(9)

Reflecting our cautious view of the euro and the high correlation of many
non-euro European currencies to the euro, we hedged out this implicit euro risk
from our portfolio. Additionally, we added exposure to Asian currencies versus
the euro to reflect our medium-term view of their relative value. Although the
euro's strength provided an opportunity to build positions at what we deemed
attractive valuations, it also worked against the Fund's relative performance.
Additionally, our non-euro European currency holdings generated mixed
performance. For example, the Polish zloty and Swiss franc appreciated 14.91%
and 1.87% against the euro, benefiting Fund performance.(9) Conversely, the
Swedish krona fell 0.69% against the euro and detracted from relative
performance.(9)

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT STRATEGY

The Fund also has the ability to invest in investment-grade and
subinvest-ment-grade sovereign debt. As an asset class, these investments
typically compensate for greater credit risk by offering higher yields relative
to U.S. and European benchmark treasury yield curves. U.S. dollar-denominated
emerging market debt generated a 12-month total return of +6.80% as measured by
the JPM Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (EMBIG).(10)Sovereign interest rate
spreads rose from 235 bps at the beginning of the reporting period to 323 bps by
period-end, as emerging market credit yields rose and U.S. Treasury yields
fell.(10) The Fund had limited exposure to U.S. dollar-denominated emerging
market debt given valuations, but we noted that credit fundamentals have
improved over the past few years, as shown by reserve accumulation, more
supportive economic policies and improved debt ratios.

Important Notice to Shareholders

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

For the purposes of hedging currency exchange rates, efficient portfolio
management and/or purposes of total returns, the Fund may also, from time to
time, enter into forward contracts including currency forwards, cross currency
forwards (which may result in net short currency exposure), options on
currencies or financial and index futures contracts, including interest rate
swaps. Such transactions could be effected with respect to hedges on non-U.S.
dollar denominated securities owned by the Fund or sold by the Fund but not yet
delivered, or committed or anticipated to be purchased by the Fund. The
successful use of these transactions will usually depend on the manager's
ability to accurately forecast currency exchange rate movements. Should exchange
rates move in an unexpected manner, the Fund may not achieve the anticipated
benefits of the transaction, or it may realize losses. In addition, these
techniques could result in a loss if the counterparty to the transaction does
not perform as promised. Moreover, investors should bear in mind that the Fund
is not obligated to actively engage in these transactions.

The Board of Trustees of the Fund has approved the removal of the Fund's
previous policy of limiting investments in derivative securities to 5% of the
Fund's assets.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

The Fund's Board previously authorized management to implement an open-market
share repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase Fund shares,
from time to time, in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management.
This authorization remains in effect.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (Fund) is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a non-diversified, closed-end investment
company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities and government securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
gains or losses on the contracts, as measured by the difference between the
contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at the
reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

D. INTEREST RATE SWAPS

The Fund may enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the risk of
changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps are agreements between two
parties to exchange cash flows based on a notional principal amount. The net
interest receivable or payable is recorded as unrealized appreciation or
depreciation. Payments received or made are recorded as realized gain or loss on
the Statement of Operations. Interest rate swaps are marked to market daily
based upon quotations from the market makers and the change, if any, is recorded
as an unrealized gain or loss in the Statement of Operations. When the swap
contract is terminated early, the fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the current realized value and the expected cash flows.
The risks of interest rate swaps include changes in the market conditions and
the possible inability of the counterparty to fulfill its obligations under the
agreement.

E. OPTIONS

The Fund may purchase or write options. Options are contracts entitling the
holder to purchase or sell securities, currencies, or other financial
instruments at a specified price or exchange rate, or, in the case of index
options, to receive or pay the difference between the index value and the strike
price of the index option. Options purchased are recorded as investments;
options written (sold) are recorded as liabilities. Upon closing of an option
which results in a cash settlement, the difference between the premium (original
option value) and the settlement proceeds is realized as a gain or loss. When
securities are acquired or delivered upon exercise of an option, the acquisition
cost or sale proceeds are adjusted by the amount of the premium. When an option
expires, the premium is realized as a gain for options written or as a loss for
options purchased. The risks include the possibility there may be an illiquid
options market or the inability of the counterparties to fulfill their
obligations under the contract. Writing options involves, to varying degrees,
elements of market risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.

F. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years and as of August 31, 2008, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

G. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These differences
may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among
capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no
impact on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

Inflation-indexed bonds provide an inflation hedge through periodic increases or
decreases in the security's interest accruals and principal redemption value, by
amounts corresponding to the current rate of inflation. Any such adjustments,
including adjustments to principal redemption value, are recorded as interest
income.

H. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

I. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, interest rate

primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, and bond discounts and premiums.

10. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 10.42% of its portfolio invested in high yield, senior secured
floating rate notes, or other securities rated below investment grade. These
securities may be more sensitive to economic conditions causing greater price
volatility and are potentially subject to a greater risk of loss due to default
than higher rated securities.

11. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

12. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157), which defines fair
value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures
about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Fund
believes the adoption of SFAS 157 will have no material impact on its financial
statements.

In March 2008, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133"
(SFAS 161), which expands disclosures about derivative investments and hedging
activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after November 15, 2008. The Fund is currently evaluating the impact, if any, of
applying the various provisions of SFAS 161.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Global Income Fund (the
"Fund") at August 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at August
31, 2008 by correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

Templeton Global Income Fund

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

Under Section 871(k)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund
designates the maximum amount allowable but no less than $1,255,909 as interest
related dividends for purposes of the tax imposed under Section 871(a)(1)(A) of
the Code for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2008.

At August 31, 2008, more than 50% of the Templeton Global Income Fund's total
assets were invested in securities of foreign issuers. In most instances,
foreign taxes were withheld from income paid to the Fund on these investments.
As shown in the table below, the Fund designates to shareholders the foreign
source income and foreign taxes paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the Code. This
designation will allow shareholders of record on August 18, 2008, to treat their
proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by the Fund as having been paid
directly by them. The shareholder shall consider these amounts as foreign taxes
paid in the tax year in which they receive the Fund distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis of foreign tax paid, foreign
source income and foreign qualified dividends as designated by the Fund to Class
A shareholders of record.

</TABLE>

Foreign Tax Paid Per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a minimum of 16
days during the 31-day period beginning 15 days before the ex-dividend date of
the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate), or, as a tax
deduction.

Foreign Source Income Per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends that have not been adjusted for the
rate differential applicable to such dividend income.(1)

Foreign Qualified Dividends Per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund.(1)

Templeton Global Income Fund

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

In January 2009, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2008. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been adjusted for the rate differential on foreign source qualified dividend
income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2008 individual income
tax returns.

(1)  Qualified dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (5% for those in the
     10% and 15% income tax bracket). In determining the amount of foreign tax
     credit that may be applied against the U.S. tax liability of individuals
     receiving foreign source qualified dividends, adjustments may be required
     to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation to reflect the rate
     differential applicable to such dividend income. The rules however permit
     certain individuals to elect not to apply the rate differential adjustments
     for capital gains and/or dividends for any taxable year. Please consult
     your tax advisor and the instructions to Form 1116 for more information.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan. If you decide
to use this service, share dividends and capital gains distributions will be
reinvested automatically in shares of the Fund for your account. BNY Mellon
Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8035, will provide
additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "BNY Mellon" and sent to BNY
Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8009,
Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The Plan Administrator will apply such
payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees)
to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fee for a sale of shares through the Plan is $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

A participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written
notice to the Plan Administrator sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P. O.
Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8035. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds to the
participant, less a service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per
share.

DIRECT DEPOSIT SERVICE FOR REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS

Cash distributions can now be electronically credited to a checking or savings
account at any financial institution that participates in the Automated Clearing
House ("ACH") system. The Direct Deposit service is provided for registered
shareholders at no charge. To enroll in the service, access your account online
by going to http://vault.bnymellon.com/isd or dial 1-800-416-5585 (toll free)
and follow the instructions. Direct Deposit will begin with the next scheduled
distribution payment date following enrollment in the service.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held May 20, 2008, the Board of Trustees (Board), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for the Fund. In reaching this decision, the
Board took into account information furnished throughout the year at regular
Board meetings, as well as information prepared specifically in connection with
the annual renewal review process. Information furnished and discussed
throughout the year included investment performance reports and related
financial information for the Fund, as well as periodic reports on shareholder
services, legal, compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and
other services provided by the Investment Manager (Manager) and its affiliates.
Information furnished specifically in connection with the renewal process
included a report for the Fund prepared by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper), an independent
organization, as well as a Fund profitability analysis report prepared by
management. The Lipper report compared the Fund's investment performance and
expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable to the Fund as selected by
Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report discussed the profitability to
Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall U.S. fund operations, as well as
on an individual fund-by-fund basis. Included with such profitability analysis
report was information on a fund-by-fund basis listing portfolio managers and
other accounts they manage, as well as information on management fees charged by
the Manager and its affiliates including management's explanation of differences
where relevant and a three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any
increase in expense ratios. Additional material accompanying such report was a
memorandum prepared by management describing project initiatives and capital
investments relating to the services provided to the Fund by the Franklin
Templeton Investments organization, as well as a memorandum relating to
economies of scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished them showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. Favorable consideration was given to management's continuous
efforts and expenditures in establishing back-up systems and recovery procedures
to function in the event of a natural disaster, it being noted that such systems
and procedures had

functioned smoothly during the Florida hurricanes and blackouts experienced in
recent years. Consideration was also given to the experience of the Fund's
portfolio management team, the number of accounts managed and general method of
compensation. In this latter respect, the Board noted that a primary factor in
management's determination of a portfolio manager's bonus compensation was the
relative investment performance of the funds he or she managed and that a
portion of such bonus was required to be invested in a predesignated list of
funds within such person's fund management area so as to be aligned with the
interests of Fund shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the agreement renewal.
The Lipper report for the Fund showed its investment performance for the
one-year period ended February 29, 2008, as well as the previous 10 years ended
that date in respect to a performance universe selected by Lipper. Such
performance universe consisted of the Fund and all other closed-end nonleveraged
global income funds and amounted to a total of five funds for the one-year
period, three funds for the previous three-year period and two funds for the
previous five- and 10-year periods. Such report considered both the Fund's
income return and total return on a net asset value basis without regard to
market discounts or premiums to accurately reflect investment performance. The
Lipper report showed that the Fund's income return for the one-year period was
the highest in such universe, and on an annualized basis was also the highest in
such universe for the previous three-year period, but was lower than the only
other fund existing in such universe for the previous five- and 10-year periods.
The Lipper report showed the Fund's total return to be the highest in such
universe for the one-year period, and on an annualized basis, was the highest in
such universe for each of the previous three-, five- and 10-year periods as
well. The Board was satisfied with such comparative performance.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with a Lipper
selected expense group consisting of the Fund and the four other closed-end
funds comprising the closed-end fund group referred to in the discussion of
investment performance. Prior to making such comparison, the Board relied upon a
survey showing that the scope of management advisory services covered under the
Fund's investment management agreement was similar to those provided by fund
managers to other fund groups. In reviewing comparative costs, emphasis was
given to the Fund's contractual investment management fee in comparison with the
contractual investment management fee that would have been charged by the other
funds within the Lipper expense group assuming they were similar in size to the
Fund, as well as the actual total expenses of the Fund in comparison with those
of the other funds. The Lipper contractual investment management fee analysis
considers administrative fees to be part of management fees and the results of
such expense comparison showed both the Fund's contractual investment management
fee rate and total actual expense rate to be the lowest in its Lipper expense
group. The Board was satisfied with the Fund's comparative management fee and
expenses.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
the Fund. Specific attention was given to the methodology followed in allocating
costs to the Fund, it being recognized that allocation methodologies are
inherently subjective and various allocation methodologies may each be
reasonable while producing different results. In this respect, the Board noted
that, while being continuously refined and reflecting changes in the Manager's
own cost accounting, the allocation methodology was consistent with that
followed in profitability report presentations for the Fund made in prior years
and that the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm had been
engaged by the Manager to perform certain procedures on a biennial basis,
specified and approved by the Manager and the Fund's Board solely for their
purposes and use in reference to the profitability analysis. In reviewing and
discussing such analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief that
costs incurred in establishing the infrastructure necessary for the type of fund
operations conducted by the Manager and its affiliates may not be fully
reflected in the expenses allocated to the Fund in determining its
profitability, as well as the fact that the level of profits, to a certain
extent, reflected operational cost savings and efficiencies initiated by
management. The Board also took into account management's expenditures in
improving shareholder services provided the Fund, as well as the need to meet
additional regulatory and compliance requirements resulting from the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and recent SEC and other regulatory requirements. In
addition, the Board considered a third-party study comparing the profitability
of the Manager's parent on an overall basis as compared to other publicly held
managers broken down to show profitability from management operations exclusive
of distribution expenses, as well as profitability including distribution
expenses. The Board also considered the extent to which the Manager and its
affiliates might derive ancillary benefits from fund operations. Based upon its
consideration of all these factors, the Board determined that the level of
profits realized by the Manager and its affiliates from providing services to
the Fund was not excessive in view of the nature, quality and extent of services
provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares, and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders. In this respect, the Board
noted the Fund is charged a management advisory fee and administrative fee at
the combined rate of 0.70% on its first $200 million of net assets;

0.635% on the next $500 million of net assets; 0.60% on the next $300 million of
net assets; and 0.58% on the next $4 billion of net assets with decreasing
breakpoints continuing through the $20 billion net asset level. The Fund's asset
size was approximately $1.2 billion on December 31, 2007, and the Board believed
such fee schedule provides a sharing of benefits with the Fund and its
shareholders.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.  N/A

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors/trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve
all conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client, broker
and vendor lists, information periodically gathered from directors and officers,
and information derived from other sources, including public filings. In
situations where a material conflict of interest is identified, the Proxy Group
will refer the matter, along with the recommended course of action by the
manager to an interdepartmental Proxy Review Committee (which may include
portfolio managers and/or research analysts employed by the manager), for
evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy Review Committee may defer to the
voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another
independent third party provider of proxy services; or send the proxy directly
to the Fund with a recommendation regarding the vote for approval. Where the
Proxy Review Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the
instructions of a representative of the Fund, such as the board of trustees or a
committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on Section 12(d)(1) of the 1940 Act, or pursuant to
an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests uninvested cash in affiliated
money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive order ("cash sweep
arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's governing documents
or applicable law. Echo voting means that the investment manager will vote the
shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the other holders of the
Fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. In light of several high
profile accounting scandals, the manager will closely scrutinize the role and
performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the manager will examine
proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit fees. The manager
will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and
will vote against the ratification of auditors when there is clear and
compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

1. The various pooled investment vehicles and accounts listed are managed by a
team of investment professionals. Accordingly, the individual managers listed
would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures help to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. As noted above, the separate management of the trade
execution and valuation functions from the portfolio management process also
helps to reduce potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected
for funds or accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected
for the Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         Franklin Resources stock (17.5% to 25%) and mutual fund shares (17.5%
         to 25%). The deferred equity-based compensation is intended to build a
         vested interest of the portfolio manager in the financial performance
         of both Franklin Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The
         bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus
         compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving
         consistently strong investment performance, which aligns the financial
         incentives of the portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief
         Investment Officer of the manager and/or other officers of the manager,
         with responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of
         annual bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin
         Templeton guidelines. The following factors are generally used in
         determining bonuses under the plan:

         |X|  INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Primary consideration is given to the
              historic investment performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding
              years of all accounts managed by the portfolio manager. The
              pre-tax performance of each fund managed is measured relative to a
              relevant peer group and/or applicable benchmark as appropriate.

         |X|  NON-INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The more qualitative contributions of
              a portfolio manager to the manager's business and the investment
              management team, including professional knowledge, productivity,
              responsiveness to client needs and communication, are evaluated in
              determining the amount of any bonus award.

         |X|  RESPONSIBILITIES. The characteristics and complexity of funds
              managed by the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's
              appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of Franklin Resources stock
         or restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds, and options
         to purchase common shares of Franklin Resources stock. Awards of such
         deferred equity-based compensation typically vest over time, so as to
         create incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager (such amounts may change from time to time):


                                        Dollar Range of Fund
                                         Shares Beneficially
          Portfolio Manager                     Owned

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised March 06, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.


II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.


III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

TO: Franklin Resources General Counsel, Legal Department

I hereby acknowledge receipt of a copy of Franklin Templeton Fund's code of
ethics for Principal Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers (the

1. Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2. Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

3. Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4. Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.

5. See Part X.

operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process,
summarize, and report financial information; and
