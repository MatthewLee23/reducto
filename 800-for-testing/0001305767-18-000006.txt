President's Letter

While 2017 delivered strong positive performance, 2018, thus far, has
introduced market volatility. Equity and fixed-income markets pulled back in
the first quarter of this year, as the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and the
Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index both finished in negative
territory, returning -0.76% and -1.46%, respectively, for the three-month
period ended March 31, 2018. Concerns about the sustainability of the pace of
economic growth, extended equity valuations, and rising interest rates drove a
significant stock market sell-off beginning in late January, approaching
correction levels. The market did recover from its initial slump, but this
year's significant fluctuations have served to remind investors that even the
strongest "bulls" cannot run forever. Within fixed income, rising interest
rates helped drive down returns of most asset classes in the first quarter,
though floating-rate sectors such as bank loans fared well in the rising-rate
environment.

Our view is that the first-quarter pause in the market's near-continuous upward
momentum over the previous 15 months, dating back to the final quarter of 2016,
presents an opportunity for investors to enter the market at healthier
valuation levels. We believe fundamentals are still quite positive, yet also
believe that caution is warranted given that the market remains vulnerable to
corrections. Some areas, such as growth stocks, appear expensive, but we do see
opportunity in value stocks, with prices supported by better corporate earnings
due to the recent tax reforms in the U.S. as well as robust, nominal gross
domestic product (GDP) growth. In fact, GDP growth in the U.S. rose to close to
or better than 3% over the final three quarters of 2017, and GDP growth in the
first quarter of 2018 registered at 2.3%.

In the fixed-income markets, we believe investors should consider positioning
their portfolios to defend against rising interest rates, with underweight
positions in U.S. Treasuries. We see more attractive valuations within
structured investment vehicles, such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in
both the agency and non-agency residential MBS sectors, as fundamentals within
the U.S. housing market remain positive. We believe that agency MBS, in
particular, offer investors reasonable value.

Since 1928, the foundation of Amundi Pioneer's investment approach has been
active management, which is especially important during periods of market
volatility. We believe investors can benefit from the experience and tenure of
our investment teams who make active and informed decisions across our funds.
In fact, the Pioneer Fund, the third-oldest mutual fund in the U.S., recently
celebrated its 90th birthday. We believe the Fund serves as an important
ambassador of our time-tested value style of investing and our early focus on
understanding the potential benefits of investing in companies with

sustainable business models. Over its nine decades of existence -- a time
period that included a Great Depression, a devastating World War, a long Cold
War, and enormous technological as well as societal changes -- the Fund has
been well-served by this investment approach.

As always, and particularly during times of market uncertainty, we encourage
you to work with your financial advisor to develop an overall investment plan
that addresses both your short- and long-term goals, and to implement such a
plan in a disciplined manner.

We greatly appreciate the trust you have placed in us and look forward to
continuing to serve you in the future.

Portfolio Management Discussion | 5/31/18

In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that
influenced the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during the six-month
period ended May 31, 2018. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice president and a portfolio
manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc., is responsible for the
day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q     How did the Trust perform during the six-month period ended May 31, 2018?

A     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 2.66% at net asset value (NAV) and
      2.44% at market price during the six-month period ended May 31, 2018,
      while the Trust's benchmark, the Standard & Poor's/Loan Syndications &
      Trading Association Leveraged Loan Index (the S&P/LSTA Index), returned
      2.44%. Unlike the Trust, the S&P/LSTA Index does not use leverage. While
      the use of leverage increases investment opportunity, it also increases
      investment risk.

      During the same six-month period, the average return (at market price) of
      the 41 closed end funds in Morningstar's Bank Loan Closed End Funds
      category (which may or may not be leveraged), was 4.91%, and the average
      return (at NAV) of the 41 closed end funds in the same Morningstar
      category was 2.97%.

      The shares of the Trust were selling at a 7.9% discount to NAV on May 31,
      2018. Comparatively, the shares of the Trust were selling at a 7.7%
      discount to NAV on November 30, 2018.

      The Trust's standardized, 30-day SEC yield was 4.75% on May 31, 2018*.

Q     How would you describe the investment environment for investing in bank
      loans during the six-month period ended May 31, 2018?

A     Entering the six-month period, credit-sensitive areas of the market,
      including bank loans, continued to be supported by positive economic data.
      The U.S. economy posted gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the 3%
      range over the last three quarters of 2017, against a backdrop of robust
      corporate earnings and arguably full employment. Credit-market sentiment
      received an additional boost as 2017 drew to a close with the passage of a
      U.S. tax reform package that included a lowering of the corporate tax
      rate, a one-time opportunity for companies to repatriate cash held
      overseas on favorable terms, and a window during which companies can
      accelerate the expensing of capital investments.**

*     The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized formula that is based on the
      hypothetical annualized earning power (investment income only) of the
      Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

**    Credit-sensitive investments, such as high-yield corporate bonds and bank
      loans, are more vulnerable to credit risk, or sensitivity to default by
      the issuer, and/or the chance that a portion of the principal and interest
      will not be paid back to investors.

<PAGE>

      In addition to a strong fundamental backdrop for credit, bank loans remain
      attractive as an asset class due to a rising-interest-rate environment.
      During the period, the U.S. Federal Reserve System (the Fed) implemented
      increases in the target range for its overnight lending rate in December
      2017 and March 2018, thus putting upward pressure on the LIBOR reference
      rates used to set the baseline for yields on most bank loans (LIBOR refers
      to London Interbank Offered Rate). The impact of the Fed's rate hikes on
      loan yields was somewhat muted, however, as many borrowers have recently
      elected to tie payments to one-month LIBOR in lieu of the traditional
      three-month LIBOR. Increases in the one-month LIBOR rate have been
      temporarily suppressed to a degree in recent months by reduced demand for
      shorter-term investments, given the prospect of U.S. companies
      repatriating cash post-tax reform. The upward movement in loan yields was
      also constrained by spread-tightening and a favorable refinancing
      environment, as loan sentiment has been supported by a low default rate.
      (Loan spreads are the interest rates over and above the LIBOR rate charged
      to borrowers by banks.)

      April 2018 saw U.S. Treasury yields embark on another upward leg in the
      wake of the release of the Fed's March meeting minutes, which pointed
      toward a consensus among committee members that U.S. inflation was safely
      headed toward its target and that there was, perhaps, room to raise the
      federal funds rate more rapidly than previously expected. As April drew to
      a close, first-quarter 2018 GDP growth was reported at 2.3%. While the
      readout represented a drop off from the prior three quarters, the slowing
      was widely attributed to seasonal factors.

      Supply-and-demand factors were generally favorable for bank loans over
      most of the six-month period ended May 31, 2018. For much of the period,
      new issuance was below levels from a year ago. Loan performance also
      benefited from strong institutional demand for yield, as reflected in
      robust collateralized loan obligation (CLO) formation. In addition, retail
      flows into loan mutual funds moved from negative in late 2017 to
      consistently positive as 2018 progressed.

      As the period drew to a close, however, secondary loan prices retreated
      due to a significant increase in net supply, which was driven by an uptick
      in new issuance and, to a lesser degree, slowing loan repayments. May of
      2018 saw the highest level of primary loan supply in the market since
      January 2017. For the full six-month period, loan prices were essentially
      flat, as positive price performance in December 2017 and January 2018 was
      offset by price softening over the last four months.

                     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18 5

<PAGE>

      Against a strong fundamental backdrop for credit-sensitive investments,
      lower-quality loans rated in the "CCC" and lower "B" ranges generally
      outperformed higher-quality loans for the six months.

Q     What factors had the biggest effects on the Trust's performance relative
      to the benchmark S&P/LSTA Index during the six-month period ended May 31,
      2018?

A     Loan selection results made the biggest positive contribution to the
      Trust's benchmark-relative performance during the period. Selection
      results were especially strong within health care and electronics, while
      the portfolio's holdings within home furnishings and the metals & mining
      industries lagged.

      In terms of individual loan names, a position in Commercial Barge Line
      contributed positively to the Trust's performance, as asset sales by the
      inland marine shipping company led to improved market sentiment towards
      the loan. The Trust's exposure to printer cartridge and mobile phone
      remanufacturer 4L Technologies also contributed positively to
      benchmark-relative returns, as the company's sales and profitability
      trends showed signs of improving. A position in wireline telecommunication
      firm Frontier was another positive contributor to the Trust's performance,
      as the loan price benefited from the company's efforts to refinance its
      debt and improve cash flow.

      On the negative side within loan selection, the biggest detractors from
      the Trust's performance during the period included the loans of
      oilfield-services company Dixie Electric, mattress company Serta Simmons
      Bedding, health supplement company Nature's Bounty, and in-store marketing
      and promotion company Catalina.

      The Trust's allocations across several industries made a positive
      contribution to performance, with a modest underweight to the insurance
      industry and a modest overweight to surface transportation aiding results,
      along with significant underweights to both the business equipment &
      services and electronics segments of the loan market.

      Conversely, a moderate underweight to retail, and a modest underweight to
      the food & drug sector detracted from the Trust's performance, along with
      a moderate overweight to the automotive segment.

      From a quality perspective, the Trust's positioning in the various loan
      rating categories was essentially neutral to benchmark-relative
      performance.

      Finally, small out-of-benchmark portfolio positions in high-yield
      corporate bonds and event-linked securities, which are issued by insurers
      to mitigate the impact of claims in the wake of a natural disaster,
      contributed slightly to the Trust's benchmark-relative performance.

<PAGE>

Q     How did the level of leverage in the Trust change over the six-month
      period ended May 31, 2018?

A     The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility.

      At the end of the six-month period on May 31, 2018, 31.9% of the Trust's
      total managed assets were financed by leverage (or borrowed funds),
      compared with 31.8% of the Trust's total managed assets financed by
      leverage at the start of the period on December 1, 2017. The absolute
      amount of funds borrowed by the Trust did not change during the period.
      The increase in the percentage of leveraged funds was the result of
      depreciation in the values of the Trust's holdings.

Q     Did the Trust invest in any derivative securities during the six-month
      period ended May 31, 2018? If so, did the derivatives have a notable
      effect on the Trust's performance?

A     We invested in high-yield bond credit-default swap indices during the
      period, principally to maintain liquidity in the Trust's portfolio. The
      derivatives had no material impact on the Trust's performance.

Q     Did the Trust's distributions to shareholders change during the six-month
      period ended May 31, 2018?

A     No, the Trust's distributions remained stable during the period. However,
      the Trust has drawn on accumulated net investment income in paying the
      Trust's distributions in recent periods, and these reserves may be
      depleted over time.

Q     What is your investment outlook?

A     The default rate on loans for the 12-month period ended May 31, 2018, was
      2.12% by loan volume, below the historical average of slightly over 3%.
      The default rate by number of issuers was 1.72%, also below the long-term
      average. We view loan fundamentals as positive and expect defaults to
      remain manageable. That said, areas of the loan market, such as retail and
      media, remain under pressure, and that defaults in those sectors could
      edge higher from current levels.

      With regard to the Trust's current allocations, we have modestly reduced
      the portfolio's benchmark-relative underweight to retailers, because even
      though the sector is under stress from ever-increasing online competition,
      defaults, so far, have not risen as much as we thought they would, while
      valuations have become quite compelling. The Trust is also underweight
      business equipment & services, electronics, and hotels & casinos. With the
      current U.S. economic recovery headed into its 10th year, we have been
      trimming the Trust's overweight to the cyclical automotive segment. Other
      current portfolio overweights are in the food products, air
      transportation, and aerospace & defense market segments.

      We believe bank loans have demonstrated their value in a rising-rate
      environment, as they have outperformed both high-yield and
      investment-grade corporate bonds in the past few months. The loan market
      has recently seen an uptick in the amount of leverage utilized in buyout
      activity, and we have refrained from having the Trust participate in a
      number of the more-levered deals. We are instead emphasizing the debt of
      borrowers with strong cash flows, which may help ensure that they can pay
      their obligations should interest rates rise meaningfully from here, or if
      there is a downturn in economic conditions.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 13-45 for a full listing
of Trust securities.

All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal.
In the past several years, financial markets have experienced increased
volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity, and heightened
uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen, or spread.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency
exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to
attempt to increase the Trust's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be
considered speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. Using
derivatives can increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when
the market prices, interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves
behave in a way not anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can
increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in floating-rate senior loans and other securities which may be less liquid or
illiquid. Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of
their value at times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the
market price of illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of
more liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and
investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the
Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage
creates significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or
capital appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage
will not be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely
affect the return for shareowners.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage

employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment portfolio or
take other actions at what might be inopportune times in the market. Such
actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners over time,
which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the Trust's
shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Any information in this shareowner report regarding market or economic trends
or the factors influencing the Trust's historical or future performance are
statements of opinion as of the date of this report. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit www.amundipioneer.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously
offered. There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of
closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock
exchange and frequently trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per share is
total assets less total liabilities, which include preferred shares, or
borrowings, as applicable, divided by the number of shares outstanding.
When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends
are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained through open-market purchases
under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and,
unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. The
indices do not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The
investment objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income
and the Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital
to the extent consistent with its investment objective of high current income.

On July 3, 2017, Amundi acquired Pioneer Investments, a group of asset
management companies located throughout the world. Amundi, one of the world's
largest asset managers, is headquartered in Paris, France. As a result of the
transaction, Pioneer Investment Management, Inc., the Trust's investment
adviser, became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Amundi and Amundi's
wholly owned subsidiary, Amundi USA, Inc. Prior to July 3, 2017, Pioneer
Investments was owned by Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A., a wholly owned
subsidiary of UniCredit S.p.A.

In connection with the transaction, the names of the Trust's investment adviser
and principal underwriter changed. Effective July 3, 2017, the name of Pioneer
Investment Management, Inc. changed to Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc.
(the "Adviser") and the name of Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc. changed to
Amundi Pioneer Distributor, Inc. (the "Distributor").

In October 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") released its
Final Rule on Investment Company Reporting Modernization. In addition to
introducing two new regulatory reporting forms (Form N-PORT and Form N-CEN),
the Final Rule amends Regulation S-X, which impacts financial statement
presentation, particularly related to the presentation of derivative
investments. The Trust's financial statements were prepared in compliance with
the amendments to Regulation S-X.

The Trust's financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") that require the
management of the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of income, expenses and gain or loss on investments during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

52 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18


<PAGE>

The Trust is an investment company and follows investment company accounting
and reporting guidance under U.S. GAAP. The following is a summary of
significant accounting policies followed by the Trust in the preparation of its
financial statements:

A.    Security Valuation

      The net asset value of the Trust is computed once daily, on each day the
      New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is open, as of the close of regular
      trading on the NYSE.

      Fixed income securities are valued by using prices supplied by independent
      pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices, market
      events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
      maturities and ratings, or may use a pricing matrix or other fair value
      methods or techniques to provide an estimated value of the security or
      instrument. A pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on the
      basis of current market prices for other debt securities, historical
      trading patterns in the market for fixed income securities and/or other
      factors. Non-U.S. debt securities that are listed on an exchange will be
      valued at the bid price obtained from an independent third party pricing
      service. When independent third party pricing services are unable to
      supply prices, or when prices or market quotations are considered to be
      unreliable, the value of that security may be determined using quotations
      from one or more broker-dealers.

      Loan interests are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the
      Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked
      prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing
      Corporation, an independent third party pricing service. If price
      information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation, or if the
      price information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be
      obtained from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable
      price quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing
      service, broker quotes will be solicited.

      Event-linked bonds or catastrophe bonds are valued at the bid price
      obtained from an independent third party pricing service. Other insurance
      linked securities (including sidecars, collateralized reinsurance and
      industry loss warranties) may be valued at the bid price obtained from an
      independent pricing service, or through a third party using a pricing
      matrix, insurance industry valuation models, or other fair value methods
      or techniques to provide an estimated value of the instrument.

      Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are valued by using the
      last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Equity
      securities that have not traded on the date of valuation, or securities
      for which sale

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18 53

<PAGE>

      prices are not available, generally are valued using the mean between the
      last bid and asked prices or, if both last bid and asked prices are not
      available, at the last quoted bid price. Last sale and bid and asked
      prices are provided by independent third party pricing services. In the
      case of equity securities not traded on an exchange, prices are typically
      determined by independent third party pricing services using a variety of
      techniques and methods.

      The value of foreign securities is translated in U.S. dollars based on
      foreign currency exchange rate quotations supplied by a third party
      pricing source. Trading in non-U.S. equity securities is substantially
      completed each day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The
      values of such securities used in computing the net asset value of the
      Trust's shares are determined as of such times. The Trust may use a fair
      value model developed by an independent pricing service to value non-U.S.
      equity securities.

      Swap contracts, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors (other than
      centrally cleared swap contracts) are valued at the dealer quotations
      obtained from reputable International Swap Dealers Association members.
      Centrally cleared swaps are valued at the daily settlement price provided
      by the central clearing counterparty.

      Shares of open-end registered investment companies (including money market
      mutual funds) are valued at such funds' net asset value. Repurchase
      agreements are valued at par. Cash may include overnight time deposits at
      approved financial institutions.

      Securities or loan interests for which independent pricing services or
      broker-dealers are unable to supply prices or for which market prices
      and/or quotations are not readily available or are considered to be
      unreliable are valued by a fair valuation team comprised of certain
      personnel of the Adviser pursuant to procedures adopted by the Trust's
      Board of Trustees. The Adviser's fair valuation team uses fair value
      methods approved by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees. The
      Adviser's fair valuation team is responsible for monitoring developments
      that may impact fair valued securities and for discussing and assessing
      fair values on an ongoing basis, and at least quarterly, with the
      Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees.

      Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may
      include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
      market conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value
      methods if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after
      the close of the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior
      to the determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a
      significant event might include political or economic news, corporate
      restructurings, natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts.
      Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may differ significantly
      from exchange prices and such differences could be material.

54 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18


<PAGE>

      At May 31, 2018, five securities were valued using fair value methods (in
      addition to securities valued using prices supplied by independent pricing
      services, broker-dealers or using a third party insurance pricing model)
      representing 1.1% of net assets. The value of these fair valued securities
      are $3,305,296.

B.    Investment Income and Transactions

      Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
      dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
      passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
      data in the exercise of reasonable diligence. Interest income, including
      interest on income bearing cash accounts, is recorded on an accrual basis,
      net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at the applicable country
      rates and net of income accrued on defaulted securities.

      Discounts and premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are accreted
      or amortized, respectively, daily, into interest income on an effective
      yield to maturity basis with a corresponding increase or decrease in the
      cost basis of the security. Premiums and discounts related to certain
      mortgage-backed securities are amortized or accreted in proportion to the
      monthly paydowns. Interest and dividend income payable by delivery of
      additional shares is reclassified as PIK (payment-in-kind) income upon
      receipt and is included in interest and divided income, respectively.

      Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Gains and losses on
      sales of investments are calculated on the identified cost method for both
      financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.    Foreign Currency Translation

      The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
      denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
      current exchange rates.

      Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
      represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on
      foreign currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the
      difference between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars
      actually received. Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency
      exchange rates on investments are not segregated on the Statement of
      Operations from the effects of changes in the market prices of those
      securities, but are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or
      loss on investments.

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18 55

<PAGE>

D.    Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

      The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts (contracts)
      for the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price
      on a future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the
      applicable exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or
      depreciation is recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust
      records realized gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by
      entry into a closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the
      currency. Risks may arise upon entering into these contracts from the
      potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contract
      and from unanticipated movements in the value of foreign currencies
      relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 4).

      During the six months ended May 31, 2018, the Trust had entered into
      various forward foreign currency contracts that obligated the Trust to
      deliver or take delivery of currencies at specified future maturity dates.
      Alternatively, prior to the settlement date of a forward foreign currency
      contract, the Trust may close out such contract by entering into an
      offsetting contract. The average market value of forward foreign currency
      contracts open during the six months ended May 31, 2018 was $316,899.

      At May 31, 2018, the Trust had no open forward foreign currency contracts.

E.    Federal Income Taxes

      It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
      Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
      distribute all of its net taxable income and net realized capital gains,
      if any, to its shareowners. Therefore, no provision for federal Income
      taxes is required. As of November 30, 2017, the Trust did not accrue any
      interest or penalties with respect to uncertain tax positions, which, if
      applicable, would be recorded as an income tax expense on the Statement of
      Operations. Tax returns filed within the prior three years remain subject
      to examination by federal and state tax authorities.

      The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
      shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
      which may differ from U.S. GAAP. Distributions in excess of net investment
      income or net realized gains are temporary overdistributions for financial
      statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition or
      reclassification of income or distributions for financial statement and
      tax purposes. Capital accounts within the financial statements are
      adjusted for permanent book/tax differences to reflect tax character, but
      are not adjusted for temporary differences.

<PAGE>

      The tax character of current year distributions payable to shareowners
      will be determined at the end of the current taxable year. The tax
      character of distributions paid during the year ended November 30, 2017
      was as follows:

F.    Insurance-Linked Securities ("ILS")

      The Trust invests in event-linked bonds. Event-linked bonds are floating
      rate debt obligations for which the return of principal and the payment of
      interest are contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger"
      event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. The
      trigger event's magnitude may be based on losses to a company or industry,
      industry indexes or readings of scientific instruments, or may be based on
      specified actual losses. If a trigger event occurs, as defined within the
      terms of an event-linked bond, the Trust may lose a portion or all of its
      accrued interest and/or principal invested in such event-linked bond. The
      Trust is entitled to receive principal and interest payments so long as no
      trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude specified by the
      instrument. In addition to the specified trigger events, event-linked
      bonds may expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to
      issuer (credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional
      interpretations and adverse tax consequences.

      The Trust's investments in ILS may include special purpose vehicles
      ("SPVs") or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a
      reinsurer's catastrophe-oriented business, known as quota share
      instruments (sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars), or to provide
      reinsurance relating to

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18 57

<PAGE>

      specific risks to insurance or reinsurance companies through a
      collateralized instrument, known as collateralized reinsurance. Structured
      reinsurance investments also may include industry loss warranties
      ("ILWs"). A traditional ILW takes the form of a bilateral reinsurance
      contract, but there are also products that take the form of derivatives,
      collateralized structures, or exchange traded instruments.

      Structured reinsurance investments, including quota share instruments,
      collateralized reinsurance investments and ILWs, generally are subject to
      the same risks as event-linked bonds. In addition, where the instruments
      are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance contracts, the
      Trust has limited transparency into the individual underlying contracts,
      and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and sound underwriting
      practices of the issuer. Accordingly, it may be more difficult for the
      Adviser to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of the Trust's
      structured reinsurance investments, and therefore the Trust's assets are
      placed at greater risk of loss than if the Adviser had more complete
      information. Structured reinsurance instruments generally will be
      considered illiquid securities by the Trust. These securities may be
      difficult to purchase, sell or unwind. Illiquid securities also may be
      difficult to value. If the Trust is forced to sell an illiquid asset, the
      Trust may be forced to sell at a loss.

      Additionally, the Trust may invest in ILS by investing in a closed end
      interval fund, Pioneer ILS Interval Fund, an affiliate of the Adviser. At
      May 31, 2018, the Trust had no investment in Pioneer ILS Interval Fund.

G.    Risks

      At times, the Trust's investments may represent industries or industry
      sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more
      susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or
      other risks affecting those industries and sectors.

      The value of securities held by the Trust may go up or down, sometimes
      rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real
      or perceived adverse economic, political or regulatory conditions,
      inflation, changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond
      markets or adverse investor sentiment. In the past several years,
      financial markets have experienced increased volatility, depressed
      valuations, decreased liquidity and heightened uncertainty. These
      conditions may continue, recur, worsen or spread.

      The Trust invests in below investment grade (high yield) debt securities,
      floating rate loans and insurance-linked securities. The Trust may invest
      in securities and other obligations of any credit quality, including those
      that are rated below investment grade, or are unrated but are determined
      by the Adviser to be of equivalent credit quality. Below investment grade
      securities

58 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18

<PAGE>

      are commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are considered speculative
      with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal.
      Below investment grade securities, including floating rate loans, involve
      greater risk of loss, are subject to greater price volatility, and may be
      less liquid and more difficult to value, especially during periods of
      economic uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt securities. Certain
      securities in which the Trust invests, including floating rate loans, once
      sold, may not settle for an extended period (for example, several weeks or
      even longer). The Trust will not receive its sale proceeds until that
      time, which may constrain the Trust's ability to meet its obligations. The
      Trust may invest in securities of issuers that are in default or that are
      in bankruptcy. The value of collateral, if any, securing a floating rate
      loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations
      or may be difficult to liquidate. No active trading market may exist for
      many floating rate loans, and many loans are subject to restrictions on
      resale. Any secondary market may be subject to irregular trading activity
      and extended settlement periods. The Trust's investments in certain
      foreign markets or countries with limited developing markets may subject
      the Trust to a greater degree of risk than in a developed market. These
      risks include disruptive political or economic conditions and the possible
      imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency exchange restrictions.

      Interest rates in the U.S. recently have been historically low, so the
      Trust faces a heightened risk that interest rates may rise. A general rise
      in interest rates could adversely affect the price and liquidity of fixed
      income securities.

      With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct
      business, the Trust is susceptible to operational, information security
      and related risks. While the Trust's Adviser has established business
      continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent,
      limit or mitigate, such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in
      such plans and systems including the possibility that certain risks have
      not been identified. Furthermore, the Trust cannot control the
      cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the
      Trust such as Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Trust's custodian and
      accounting agent, and American Stock Transfer & Trust Company ("AST"), the
      Trust's transfer agent. In addition, many beneficial owners of Trust
      shares hold them through accounts at broker-dealers, retirement platforms
      and other financial market participants over which neither the Trust nor
      Amundi Pioneer exercises control. Each of these may in turn rely on
      service providers to them, which are also subject to the risk of
      cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity failures or breaches at Amundi Pioneer or the
      Trust's service providers or intermediaries have the ability to cause
      disruptions and impact business operations potentially resulting in
      financial losses, interference with the Trust's ability to calculate its
      net asset value, impediments to trading, the inability of Trust
      shareowners to

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18 59

<PAGE>

      effect share purchases or receive distributions, loss of or unauthorized
      access to private shareowner information and violations of applicable
      privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage,
      or additional compliance costs. Such costs and losses may not be covered
      under any insurance. In addition, maintaining vigilance against
      cyber-attacks may involve substantial costs over time, and system
      enhancements may themselves be subject to cyber-attacks.

H.    Repurchase Agreements

      Repurchase agreements are arrangements under which the Trust purchases
      securities from a broker-dealer or a bank, called the counterparty, upon
      the agreement of the counterparty to repurchase the securities from the
      Trust at a later date, and at a specific price, which is typically higher
      than the purchase price paid by the Trust. The securities purchased serve
      as the Trust's collateral for the obligation of the counterparty to
      repurchase the securities. The value of the collateral, including accrued
      interest, is required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price.
      The collateral for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the
      customer-only account of the Trust's custodian or a subcustodian of the
      Trust. The Adviser is responsible for determining that the value of the
      collateral remains at least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of
      a default by the counterparty, the Trust is entitled to sell the
      securities, but the Trust may not be able to sell them for the price at
      which they were purchased, thus causing a loss to the Trust. Additionally,
      if the counterparty becomes insolvent, there is some risk that the Trust
      will not have a right to the securities, or the immediate right to sell
      the securities. At May 31, 2018, the Trust had no open repurchase
      agreements.

I.    Credit Default Swap Contracts

      A credit default swap is a contract between a buyer of protection and a
      seller of protection against a pre-defined credit event on an underlying
      reference obligation, which may be a single security or a basket or index
      of securities. The Trust may buy or sell credit default swap contracts to
      seek to increase the Trust's income, or to attempt to hedge the risk of
      default on portfolio securities. A credit default swap index is used to
      hedge risk or take a position on a basket of credit entities or indices.

60 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18

<PAGE>

      As a seller of protection, the Trust would be required to pay the notional
      (or other agreed-upon) value of the referenced debt obligation to the
      counterparty in the event of a default by a U.S. or foreign corporate
      issuer of a debt obligation, which would likely result in a loss to the
      Trust. In return, the Trust would receive from the counterparty a periodic
      stream of payments during the term of the contract provided that no event
      of default occurred. The maximum exposure of loss to the seller would be
      the notional value of the credit default swaps outstanding. If no default
      occurs, the Trust would keep the stream of payments and would have no
      payment obligation. The Trust may also buy credit default swap contracts
      in order to hedge against the risk of default of debt securities, in which
      case the Trust would function as the counterparty referenced above.

      As a buyer of protection, the Trust makes an upfront or periodic payment
      to the protection seller in exchange for the right to receive a contingent
      payment. An upfront payment made by the Trust, as the protection buyer, is
      recorded as a component of "Swap contracts, at value" on the Statement of
      Assets and Liabilities. Periodic payments received or paid by the Trust
      are recorded as realized gains or losses on the Statement of Operations.

      Credit default swap contracts are marked-to-market daily using valuations
      supplied by independent sources and the change in value, if any, is
      recorded within the "Swap contracts, at value" line item on the Statement
      of Assets and Liabilities. Payments received or made as a result of a
      credit event or upon termination of the contract are recognized, net of
      the appropriate amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses
      on the Statement of Operations.

      Credit default swap contracts involving the sale of protection may involve
      greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the referenced debt
      instrument directly. Credit default swap contracts are subject to general
      market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the
      Trust is a protection buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its
      investment. If the Trust is a protection seller and a credit event occurs,
      the value of the referenced debt instrument received by the Trust,
      together with the periodic payments received, may be less than the amount
      the Trust pays to the protection buyer, resulting in a loss to the Trust.

      Certain swap contracts that are cleared through a central clearinghouse
      are referred to as centrally cleared swaps. All payments made or received
      by the Trust are pursuant to a centrally cleared swap contracts with the
      central clearing party rather than the original counterparty. Upon
      entering into a centrally cleared swap contract, the Trust is required to
      make an initial

                    Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18 61

<PAGE>

      margin deposit, either in cash or in securities. The daily change in value
      on open centrally cleared swap contracts is recorded as variation margin
      on centrally cleared swaps on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

      Cash received from or paid to the broker related to previous margin
      movement is held in a segregated account at the broker and is recorded as
      either "Due from broker from swaps" or "Due to broker from swaps" on the
      Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

      The amount of cash deposited with the broker as collateral at May 31, 2018
      is recorded as "Swaps collateral" on the Statement of Assets and
      Liabilities.

      Open credit default swap contracts at May 31, 2018 are listed on the
      Schedule of Investments. The average market value of credit default swap
      contracts open during the six months ended May 31, 2018 was $134,314.

J.    Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

      All shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
      automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
      "Plan"), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
      distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional shares of
      the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
      Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
      capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is
      completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without
      penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent
      for shareowners in administering the Plan (the "Plan Agent"), in writing
      prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or
      resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared
      dividend or other distribution.

      If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
      other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate
      in the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not
      offer the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of
      record. A firm or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in
      shares of the Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

      Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on shares payable in cash,
      participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares acquired by
      the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
      authorized shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares
      on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for
      any dividend, the net asset value per share is equal to or less than the
      market price per share plus estimated brokerage trading fees (market
      premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
      shares. The number of newly

62 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Semiannual Report | 5/31/18

<PAGE>

      issued shares to be credited to each account will be determined by
      dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the net asset value per
      share on the date the shares are issued, provided that the maximum
      discount from the then current market price per share on the date of
      issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any dividend, the
      net asset value per share is greater than the market value (market
      discount), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in shares
      acquired in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges with
      respect to newly issued shares. However, each participant will pay a pro
      rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan
      Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan does not relieve
      shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which may be due on
      dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan shares in a
      brokerage account may be able to transfer the shares to another broker and
      continue to participate in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

The Adviser manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the
Trust's Advisory Agreement with the Adviser are calculated daily at the annual
rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets"
means (a) the total assets of the Trust, including any form of investment
leverage, minus (b) all accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of
operations, which shall not include any liabilities or obligations attributable
to investment leverage obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type
(including, without limitation, borrowing through a credit facility or the
issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred stock or other
similar preference securities, and/or (iii) any other means. For the six months
ended May 31, 2018 the net management fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average
daily managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.03% (annualized) of the Trust's
average daily net assets.

In addition, under the Adviser's management and administration agreements,
certain other services and costs are paid by the Adviser and reimbursed by the
Trust. At May 31, 2018 $43,847 was payable to the Adviser related to management
costs, administrative costs and certain other services is included in "Due to
affiliates" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

3. Transfer Agent

American Stock & Trust Company (AST) serves as the transfer agent with respect
to the Trust's shares. The Trust pays AST an annual fee, as is agreed to from
time to time by the Trust and AST, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimbursed the transfer agent for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the transfer agent related to shareowner communications activities
such as proxy and statement mailings and outgoing calls.

4. Additional Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Trust's use of derivatives may enhance or mitigate the Trust's exposure to
the following risks:

Interest rate risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of interest-bearing
securities due to changes in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.

Credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer of a financial instrument to
make further principal or interest payments on an obligation or commitment that
it has to the Trust.

Foreign exchange rate risk relates to fluctuations in the value of an asset or
liability due to changes in currency exchange rates.

Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments
as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest
rate risk or foreign exchange risk), whether caused by factors specific to an
individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all instruments
traded in a market or market segment.

Commodity risk relates to the risk that the value of a commodity or commodity
index will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in the commodities market
and factors specific to a particular industry or commodity.

5. Unfunded Loan Commitments

The Trust may enter into unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded loan commitments
may be partially or wholly unfunded. During the contractual period, the Trust
is obligated to provide funding to the borrower upon demand. A fee is earned by
the Trust on the unfunded commitment and is recorded as interest income on the
Statement of Operations.

As of May 31, 2018, the Trust had the following unfunded loan commitments
outstanding:

7. Credit Agreement

Effective November 26, 2013, the Trust entered into a Revolving Credit Facility
(the "Credit Agreement") with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of
$160,000,000. The Credit Agreement was established in conjunction with the
redemption of all the Trust's auction market preferred shares. Effective
November 23, 2016, the Trust extended the maturity of the Credit Agreement to
November 22, 2019.

At May 31, 2018, the Trust had a borrowing outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaling $143,450,000. The interest rate charged at May 31, 2018 was
2.95%. During the six months ended May 31, 2018, the average daily balance was
$143,450,000 at an average interest rate of 2.64%. Interest expense of
$1,891,325 in connection with the Credit Agreement is included on the Statement
of Operations.

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Asset coverage is calculated by
subtracting the Trust's total liabilities not including any bank loans and
senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such amount by
the principal amount of the borrowing outstanding.

8. Subsequent Events

A monthly dividend was declared on July 3, 2018 from undistributed and
accumulated net investment income of $0.0600 per share payable July 31, 2018,
to shareowners of record on July 17, 2018.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

During the period, there have been no material changes in the Trust's
investment objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which has not been
approved by the shareowners. During the period, there have been no changes in
the principal risk factors associated with investment in the Trust. There were
no changes in the persons who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Trust's portfolio.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its shares
in the open market.

Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Prior to July 3, 2017 Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. (the "Adviser"), the
Trust's investment adviser, was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
UniCredit S.p.A. ("UniCredit"). On that date, UniCredit completed the sale of
its Pioneer Investments business, which includes the Adviser, to Amundi (the
"Transaction"). As a result of the Transaction, the Adviser became an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of Amundi. Amundi is controlled by Credit Agricole S.A.
Amundi is headquartered in Paris, France, and, as of September 30, 2016, had
more than $1.1 trillion in assets under management worldwide. Deloitte & Touche
LLP ("D&T"), the Trust's previous independent registered public accounting
firm, informed the Audit Committee and the Board that it would no longer be
independent with respect to the Trust upon the completion of the Transaction as
a result of certain services being provided to Amundi and Credit Agricole, and,
accordingly, that it intended to resign as the Trust's independent registered
public accounting firm upon the completion of the Transaction. D&T's
resignation was effective on July 3, 2017, when the Transaction was completed.

During the periods as to which D&T has served as the Trust's independent
registered public accounting firm, including the Trust's two most recent fiscal
years, D&T's reports on the Trust's financial statements have not contained an
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and have not been qualified or
modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. Further,
there have been no disagreements with D&T on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of D&T, would have caused
D&T to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection
with its report on the financial statements. In addition, there have been no
reportable events of the kind described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

<PAGE>

Effective immediately following the completion of the Transaction on July 3,
2017, the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, engaged
a new independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"),
for the Trust's fiscal year ended November 30, 2017.

Prior to its engagement, EY had advised the Trust's Audit Committee that EY had
identified the following matters, in each case relating to services rendered by
other member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, all of which are located
outside the United States, to UniCredit and certain of its subsidiaries during
the period commencing July 1, 2016, that it determined to be inconsistent with
the auditor independence rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"): (a) project management support services to UniCredit in the
Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Serbia and Slovenia in relation to twenty-two
projects, that were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(vi) of
Regulation S-X (management functions); (b) two engagements for UniCredit in
Italy where fees were contingent/success based and that were determined to be
inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(5) of Regulation S-X (contingent fees); (c) four
engagements where legal and expert services were provided to UniCredit in the
Czech Republic and Germany, and twenty engagements where the legal advisory
services were provided to UniCredit in Austria, Czech Republic, Italy and
Poland, that were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(ix) and
(x) of Regulation S-X (legal and expert services); and (d) two engagements for
UniCredit in Italy involving assistance in the sale of certain assets, that
were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(viii) of Regulation S-X
(broker-dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services). None of the
foregoing services involved the Trust, any of the other Trusts in the Pioneer
Family of Trusts or any other Pioneer entity sold by UniCredit in the
Transaction.

EY advised the Audit Committee that it had considered the matters described
above and had concluded that such matters would not impair EY's ability to
exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the
financial statements of the Trust under the SEC and Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board independence rules, and that a reasonable investor with
knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same
conclusion. Management and the Audit Committee considered these matters and
discussed the matters with EY and, based upon EY's description of the matters
and statements made by EY, Management and the Audit Committee believe that EY
will be capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in connection
with the audits of the financial statements of the Trust, and Management
further believes that a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant
facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Amudi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc, the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

                                CODE OF ETHICS

                                      FOR

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

   Fund Distributor, Inc. overlap or conflict with the provisions of the this
   Code, they are superseded by this Code.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

   A Senior Officer's responsibilities under this Code are limited to Fund
   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,
   matters in which the Senior Officer routinely participates, and matters with
   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
   Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
