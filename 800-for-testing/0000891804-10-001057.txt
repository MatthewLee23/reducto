MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund

Dear SHAREHOLDER |

We thank you for your investment in the Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity
Strategy Fund (the "Fund"). This report covers the Fund's performance for the
12 months ended December 31, 2009.

The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide a high level of current
income and current gains, with a secondary objective of long-term capital
appreciation. The Fund pursues its investment objectives by investing in a
portfolio consisting primarily of high-quality, large-capitalization common
stocks that are, in the view of the Fund's investment manager, selling at a
reasonable price in relation to their long-term earnings growth rates. On an
ongoing and consistent basis, the Fund sells covered call options to seek to
generate a reasonably steady return from option premiums. There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.

Under normal market conditions, the Fund allocates at least 80% of its total
assets to an integrated investment strategy pursuant to which the Fund invests
in a portfolio of equity securities and writes (sells) covered call options on
a portion of the equity securities held in the Fund's portfolio; pending
investment in equity securities or as covered call options, the assets of the
Fund allocated to its integrated investment strategy are held in cash or cash
equivalents. The Fund invests, under normal market conditions, at least 65% of
its investments in equity securities in common stocks of large capitalization
issuers that meet the Fund's selection criteria.

All Fund returns cited--whether based on net asset value ("NAV") or market
price--assume the reinvestment of all distributions. For the 12 months ended
December 31, 2009, the Fund provided a total return based on market price of
61.01% and a total return based on NAV of 39.00%. As of December 31, 2009, the
Fund's market price of $8.89 per share represented a discount of 7.59% to its
NAV of $9.62 per share. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The
market price of the Fund's shares fluctuates from time to time, and it may be
higher or lower than the Fund's NAV.

The Fund paid quarterly dividends of $0.2400 on February 27, 2009, $0.1800 on
May 29 and August 31, 2009; and $0.1962 on November 30, 2009. The most recent
dividend included a supplemental distribution component of $0.0162 per share in
order for the Fund to meet its distribution requirements. The regular quarterly
component of this distribution, which was $0.18 per share, represents an
annualized distribution rate of 8.10% based on the Fund's closing market price
of $8.89 on December 31, 2009. However, there is no guarantee that this level
of income will be maintained.

Claymore Advisors, LLC (the "Adviser") is the investment adviser to the Fund.
Claymore entities provided supervision, management or servicing on
approximately $15.2 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009. Madison Asset
Management, LLC, ("MAM"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Madison Investment
Advisors, Inc., (collectively "Madison") is the Fund's investment manager (the
"Investment Manager"). Founded in 1974, Madison is an independently owned firm
that, with its affiliates, manages approximately $15 billion in individual,
corporate, pension, insurance, endowment, and mutual fund assets as of December
31, 2009.

On July 17, 2009, Claymore Group Inc., the parent of the Adviser, entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger between and among Claymore Group Inc., Claymore
Holdings, LLC and GuggClay Acquisition, Inc. (with the latter two entities
being wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of Guggenheim Partners, LLC
("Guggenheim")). The transaction closed on October 14, 2009 (the "Effective
Date"), whereby GuggClay Acquisition, Inc. merged into Claymore Group Inc., the
surviving entity. The transaction resulted in a change-of-control whereby
Claymore Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the Adviser, became
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Guggenheim. The transaction has not
affected the daily operations of the Fund or the investment management
activities of the Adviser.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "1940 Act"), the
consummation of this transaction resulted in the automatic termination of the
Advisory & Investment Management Agreements. Accordingly, on September 23,
2009, the Board of Trustees approved an interim investment advisory agreement
between the Fund and the Adviser (the "Interim Advisory Agreement") and an
interim investment management agreement among the Fund, the Adviser and MAM
(the "Interim Investment Management Agreement" and together with the Interim
Advisory Agreement, the "Interim Agreements"). The terms and conditions of the
Interim Agreements are substantively identical to those of the original
Advisory Agreement and Investment Management Agreement.

On September 23, 2009, the Board of Trustees approved a new investment advisory
agreement between the Fund and the Adviser (the "New Advisory Agreement") and a
new investment

continued

management agreement among the Fund, the Adviser and MAM (the "New Investment
Management Agreement" and together with the New Advisory Agreement, the "New
Agreements") and recommended that the New Agreements be submitted to the
shareholders of the Fund for their approval. The New Agreements, which were
approved by shareholders on February 2, 2010, have an initial term of one year.
Thereafter, the New Agreements will continue in effect only if their
continuance is annually approved by the Board of Trustees. Other than effective
dates, there are no material differences between the terms of the New
Agreements and those of the original Advisory Agreement and Investment
Management Agreement.

On July 22, 2009, the Fund's Board of Trustees approved an open market share
repurchase plan (the "Plan") and the Fund added an additional portfolio
manager. Under the terms of the Plan, the Fund is authorized to purchase up to
5% of its outstanding common shares in the open market on a quarterly basis,
subject to applicable regulatory and legal restrictions and in consideration of
certain operational and market factors, including the size of the market price
discount to net asset value of the Fund. The amount and timing of repurchases
will be at the discretion of the Investment Manager, and subject to market
conditions and investment considerations. The Fund intends to conduct the Plan
in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Plan is intended to enhance shareholder value. The Fund's Board of Trustees
has authorized the share repurchase program in the belief that share
repurchases may at times represent attractive investment opportunities for the
Fund. There is no assurance that the Fund will purchase shares at any
particular discount levels or in any particular amounts. There is also no
assurance that the market price of the Fund's shares, either absolutely or
relative to net asset value, will increase as a result of any share
repurchases.

Ray Di Bernardo, CFA, has joined Frank Burgess in the day-to-day portfolio
management responsibilities for the Fund. Mr. Di Bernardo, who has been with
the Madison organization since 2003, was previously an equity analyst at
Concord Trust in Chicago, and before that, an equity analyst and co-manager of
international and emerging market mutual funds at a Toronto-based international
equity firm. Mr. Di Bernardo holds a BA from the University of Western Ontario
and is a CFA charterholder.

We encourage shareholders to consider the opportunity to reinvest their
distributions from the Fund through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan ("DRIP"),
which is described in detail on page 27 of the Fund's annual report. When
shares trade at a discount to NAV, the DRIP takes advantage of the discount by
reinvesting the quarterly dividend distribution in common shares of the Fund
purchased in the market at a price less than NAV. Conversely, when the market
price of the Fund's common shares is at a premium above NAV, the DRIP reinvests
participants' dividends in newly-issued common shares at NAV, subject to an IRS
limitation that the purchase price cannot be more than 5% below the market
price per share. The DRIP provides a cost-effective means to accumulate
additional shares and enjoy the benefits of compounding returns over time.
Since the Fund endeavors to maintain a steady monthly distribution rate, the
DRIP plan effectively provides an income averaging technique, which causes
shareholders to accumulate a larger number of Fund shares when the market price
is depressed than when the price is higher.

To learn more about the Fund's performance and investment strategy, we
encourage you to read the Questions & Answers section of the report, which
begins on page 5. You will find information about Madison's investment
philosophy and discipline, its views on the market environment and how it
structured the Fund's portfolio based on its views.

We appreciate your investment and look forward to serving your investment needs
in the future. For the most up-to-date information on your investment, please

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS |

Madison Asset Management, LLC ("MAM") is pleased to address the progress of the
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the "Fund" or "MCN") for
the year ended December 31, 2009.

Introduced in July of 2004, the Fund continues to pursue its objectives by
investing in high-quality, large-capitalization common stocks that are, in the
opinion of the MAM investment professionals, selling at a reasonable price with
respect to their long-term earnings growth rates. The Fund's option-writing
strategy seeks to provide a consistent income from option premiums which are
expected to help achieve the goal of providing a high level of current income
and current gains with a secondary objective of long-term capital
appreciation.

Madison Asset Management, LLC, a subsidiary of Madison Investment Advisors,
Inc., together with its affiliates, manages approximately $15 billion in
individual, corporate, pension, insurance, endowment, and mutual fund assets as
of December 31, 2009.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MARKET DURING 2009?

With a sense of relief, U.S. equity markets ended the year in much better form
than when they began the year. In the first months of 2009 the U.S. economy was
in a very deep recession, which some were characterizing as the start of a new
depression. Housing was in disarray, the auto market had serious problems,
unemployment was rising and the credit markets were deteriorating. There was
widespread fear that the major banks would be nationalized and by early March
these factors had driven the S&P 500 down by approximately 25%. Since then
we've experienced a sizable recovery, a record rally in a very short time.
Massive government stimulus has unfrozen credit markets, economic recovery is
underway and market psychology has shifted from fear to optimism, some might
say hyper-optimism. As a result, the S&P 500 managed a very strong 26.5% return
in 2009 with a 6.0% boost coming in the fourth quarter.

Although defensive sectors led the way in the early portion of the year as the
market continued to swoon, once the recovery gathered steam, cyclical sectors
began to assert leadership. The Technology, Consumer Discretionary and Materials
sectors were the ultimate leaders over the full year as expectations grew for a
global economic recovery. The Financial sector, which had been decimated in late
2008 and early 2009, rebounded sharply in the second and third quarter as a
semblance of stability returned to the banking system. Despite its defensive
nature and the specter of dramatic reform, the Health Care sector also rebounded
strongly, particularly late in the year as reform efforts seemed to lose
momentum.

Given the dire environment as the year began, investor fear was very high and
as a result, market volatility was near the all-time highs reached in late
2008. The CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) traded in the range of 40 to 50
early in the year but trended lower as the stock market recovered and fear
subsided, ending the year just above 20.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW DID THE FUND PERFORM GIVEN THE MARKETPLACE CONDITIONS DURING 2009?

We are very pleased to report that MCN had a tremendous year, outperforming
through the market declines in the first quarter and the rally that followed.
For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Fund provided a market price total
return of 61.01%. This compared highly favorably to the S&P 500 Index which
returned 26.46% and the CBOE S&P BuyWrite Index (BXM) which posted a 25.91%
return over the same period. Closed-end funds in general, and MCN specifically,
were pushed to deep discounts by the fear-inspired selling environment of 2008
and early 2009. A significant portion of the Fund's market price total return
for this annual period was a reduction of the market price discount to net
asset value ("NAV"), as the underlying NAV showed a robust return of 39.00%.
About a third of the market price total return in 2009 was due to a reduction
of this discount. The Fund's strong performance during the period was powered
by a combination of very favorable underlying stock performance coupled with an
option strategy that allowed the Fund to participate in the market rally.

Much transpired throughout the year from a portfolio strategy standpoint. Early
in the year, the portfolio was

MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund | QUESTIONS &
ANSWERS continued

structured to provide the most protection possible by taking advantage of the
extremely high option premiums that resulted from the excessively high level of
market volatility. As the market bottomed, call options were written
meaningfully out-of-the-money in order for the portfolio to participate in the
market rebound. This strategy worked extremely well and allowed the Fund's NAV
to recover as the market advanced. Through mid-year, as the market continued
its recovery, the Fund shifted to a more defensive posture as concerns grew
that the market may have moved too far ahead of actual underlying economic and
corporate fundamentals. Call options were written closer-to-the-money and on a
larger portion of the portfolio holdings, and proceeds from option assignments
were used to steadily reduce the Fund's leverage, which began the year at
approximately 14% of total assets and was ultimately eliminated in October.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIBE THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO EQUITY AND OPTION STRUCTURE:

As of December 31, 2009, the Fund held 51 equity securities and unexpired
covered call options had been written against 77.7% of the Fund's stock
holdings. During 2009, the Fund generated premiums of $18.3 million from its
covered call writing activities. It is the strategy of the Fund to write
out-of-the-money call options; as of December 31, 49.1% of the Fund's call
options (55 of 112 different options) remained out-of-the-money.
(Out-of-the-money means the stock price is below the strike price at which the
shares could be called away by the option holder.) The number of
out-of-the-money options has declined from the beginning of the year as the
strength of the market rally has moved many share prices above their
corresponding option strike prices. The Fund's managers have also begun writing
options "closer-to-the-money" in order to capture higher premium income and
provide the Fund added protection from a reversal in the market's upward
surge.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHICH SECTORS ARE PREVALENT IN THE FUND?

From a sector perspective, MCN's largest exposure as of December 31, 2009 was to
the Health Care and Technology (and technology related) sectors, followed by
Consumer Discretionary, Financials and Energy sectors. The Fund was not invested
in the Materials, Consumer Staples, Telecommunication Services and Utilities
sectors as of year-end.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCUSS THE FUND'S SECURITY AND OPTION SELECTION PROCESS:

The Fund is managed by two teams of investment professionals. MAM considers
these teams as a "right hand" and "left hand" meaning they work together to
make common stock and option decisions. Fundamental analysis is used to select
solid companies with good growth prospects and attractive valuations. Then MAM
seeks attractive call options to write on those stocks. It is the belief that
this partnership of active management between the equity and option teams
provides investors with an innovative, risk-moderated approach to equity
investing. The Fund's portfolio managers seek to invest in a portfolio of
common stocks that have favorable "PEG" ratios (Price-Earnings ratio to Growth
rate) as well as financial strength and industry leadership. As bottom-up
investors, the focus of MAM is on the fundamental businesses of its companies.
The stock selection philosophy strays away from the "beat the street"
mentality, as they seek companies that have sustainable competitive advantages,
predictable cash flows, solid balance sheets and high-quality management teams.
By concentrating on long-term prospects and circumventing the "instant
gratification" school of thought, the MAM investment professionals bring
elements of consistency, stability and predictability to shareholders.

Once attractive and solid names have been selected for the Fund, the call
writing strategy is employed. This procedure entails selling calls that are
primarily out-of the-money, so the Fund can participate in some stock
appreciation. By receiving option premiums, the Fund receives a high level of
investment income and adds an element of downside protection. Call options may
be written over a number of time periods and at differing strike prices in an
effort to maximize the protective value to the strategy and spread income
evenly throughout the year.

WHAT IS THE MANAGEMENT'S OUTLOOK FOR THE MARKET AND FUND IN 2010?

With 2009 providing a turning point in the stock market and economy,
management's outlook for 2010 is optimistic, although tempered by the fact that
the market has already enjoyed such a strong recovery. The MAM investment
professionals expect the economy to improve in 2010, especially
internationally. Corporate profitability should continue to expand behind solid
margins, productivity gains and improving revenue growth. Even though interest
rates may move upward, they should remain at a relatively low level, which is
positive for valuations. It is also possible that substantial assets still in
cash and lower yielding bonds which could come back into the stock market will
provide support. Although deep recessions, such as the one recently
experienced, are historically followed by steep recoveries, MAM believes that
the current recovery will likely be slower than history might suggest due to
some lingering headwinds. High unemployment, stagnant wage growth and the
prospect of higher taxes are causing consumers to save more and spend less,
crimping a key economic driver. Additionally, the financial system, while
recovering, remains wounded, as does the housing market. In general, economic
growth is expected to be moderately positive but below the long-term trend line
of 3-4%.

The explosive rally from the March 2009 lows was focused on lower quality and
economically sensitive areas with the expectation that the economy would bounce
back. This is characteristic of the first leg of a recovery. As the recovery
moves to the next leg, the market will take its direction from actual signs of
improving economic and company fundamentals which should bring the spotlight to
higher quality, blue chip companies which remain the focus within MCN's
portfolio.

Over the near term, MAM expects the stock market to consolidate its significant
gains from the market lows with increasing risk relating to the possibility that
lofty expectations of economic growth are proven to be overly optimistic. During
the wait for economic and corporate reality to catch up with expectations, the
MAM investment philosophy remains relatively defensively postured.

INDEX DEFINITIONS
Indices are unmanaged, reflect no expenses and it is not possible to invest
directly in an index.

The S&P 500 is an unmanaged, capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks. The
index is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through
changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major
industries.

The VIX-CBOE Volatility Index is widely known as the VIX Index. VIX is the
ticker symbol for the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index,
which shows the market's expectation of 30-day volatility. It is constructed
using the implied volatilities of a wide range of S&P 500 index options. This
volatility is meant to be forward looking and is calculated from both calls and
puts. The VIX is a widely used measure of market risk and is often referred to
as the "investor fear gauge."

The CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index (BXM) is a benchmark index designed to show the
hypothetical performance of a portfolio that purchases all the constituents of
the S&P 500 Index and then sells at-the-money (meaning same as purchase price)
calls of one-month duration against those positions.

MCN RISKS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
The views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only
through the report period as stated on the cover. These views are subject to
change at any time, based on market and other conditions and should not be
construed as a recommendation of any kind. The material may also include
forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty, and there is no
guarantee that any predictions will come to pass.

There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives.
The value of the Fund will fluctuate with the value of the underlying
securities. Historically, closed-end funds often trade at a discount to their
net asset value.

EQUITY RISK: The value of the securities held by the Fund will fall due to
general market and economic conditions, perceptions regarding the industries in
which the issuers of securities held by the Fund participate, or factors
relating to specific companies in which the Fund invests.

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OPTIONS ON SECURITIES: There are several risks associated
with transactions in options on securities. For example, there are significant
differences between the securities and options markets that could result in an
imperfect correlation between these markets, causing a given transaction not to
achieve its objectives. A decision as to whether, when and how to use options
involves the exercise of skill and judgment, and even a well-conceived
transaction may be unsuccessful to some degree because of market behavior or
unexpected events. As the writer of a covered call option, the Fund forgoes,
during the option's life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the
market value of the security covering the call option above the sum of the
premium and the strike price of the call, but has retained the risk of loss
should the price of the underlying security decline. The writer of an option
has no control over the time when it may be required to fulfill its obligation
as a writer of the option. Once an option writer has received an exercise
notice, it cannot effect a closing purchase transaction in order to terminate
its obligation under the option and must deliver the underlying security at the
exercise price.

FOREIGN INVESTMENT RISK: Investing in non-U.S. issuers may involve unique risks
such as currency, political, and economic risk, as well as less market
liquidity, generally greater market volatility and less complete financial
information than for U.S. issuers.

RISKS OF MID-CAP COMPANIES: Mid-cap companies often are newer or less
established companies than larger companies. Investments in mid-cap companies
carry additional risks because earnings of these companies tend to be less
predictable; they often have limited product lines, markets, distribution
channels or financial resources; and the management of such companies may be
dependent upon one or a few key people. The market movements of equity
securities of mid-cap companies may be more abrupt or erratic than the market
movements of equity securities of larger, more established companies or the
stock market in general.

INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION RISK: To the extent that the Fund makes substantial
investments in a single industry, the Fund will be more susceptible to adverse
economic or regulatory occurrences affecting those sectors.

FUND DISTRIBUTION RISK: In order to make regular quarterly distributions on its
common shares, the Fund may have to sell a portion of its investment portfolio
at a time when independent investment judgment may not dictate such action. In
addition, the Fund's ability to make distributions more frequently than
annually from any net realized capital gains by the Fund is subject to the Fund
obtaining exemptive relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which
cannot be assured. To the extent the total quarterly distributions for a year
exceed the Fund's net investment company income and net realized capital gain
for that year, the excess will generally constitute a return of the Fund's
capital to its common shareholders. Such return of capital distributions
generally are tax-free up to the amount of a common shareholder's tax basis in
the common shares (generally, the amount paid for the common shares).In
addition, such excess distributions will decrease the Fund's total assets and
may increase the Fund's expense ratio.

FINANCIAL LEVERAGE: The Fund is authorized to utilize leverage through the
issuance of preferred shares and/or the Fund may borrow or issue debt
securities for financial leveraging purposes and for temporary purposes such as
settlement of transactions. Although the use of any financial leverage by the
Fund may create an opportunity for increased net income, gains and capital
appreciation for the Common Shares, it also results in additional risks and can
magnify the effect of any losses. If the income and gains earned on securities
purchased with financial leverage proceeds are greater than the cost of
financial leverage, the Fund's return will be greater than if financial
leverage had not been used. Conversely, if the income or gain from the
securities purchased with such proceeds does not cover the cost of financial
leverage, the return to the Fund will be less than if financial leverage had
not been used. Financial leverage also increases the likelihood of greater
volatility of net asset value and market price of and dividends on the Common
Shares than a comparable portfolio without leverage.

An investment in the Fund includes, but is not limited to, risks and
considerations such as: Investment Risk, Not a Complete Investment Program,
Equity Risk, Risks Associated with Options on Securities, Limitation on Option
Writing Risk, Risks of Mid-Cap Companies, Income Risk, Foreign Securities Risk,
Industry Concentration Risk, Derivatives Risk, Illiquid Securities Risk, Fund
Distribution Risk, Market Discount Risk, Other Investment Companies, Financial
Leverage Risk, Management Risk, Risks Related to Preferred Securities, Interest
Rate Risk, Inflation Risk, Current Developments Risk and Anti-Takeover
Provisions. Please see www.claymore.com/mcn for a more detailed discussion
about Fund risks and considerations.

Notes to FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | DECEMBER 31, 2009

Note 1 -- ORGANIZATION:
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the "Fund") was organized
as a Delaware statutory trust on May 6, 2004. The Fund is registered as a
diversified, closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940.

The Fund's primary investment objective is to provide a high level of current
income and current gains, with a secondary objective of long-term capital
appreciation. The Fund will, under normal market conditions, pursue its primary
investment objective by allocating at least 80% of total assets to an
integrated investment strategy pursuant to which the Fund invests in a
portfolio of equity securities consisting primarily of high quality, large
capitalization common stocks that are, in the view of the Fund's investment
manager, selling at a reasonable price in relation to their long-term earnings
growth rates and writes (sells) covered call options against a portion of the
equity securities held; pending investment in equity securities or covered call
options, assets of the Fund allocated to its integrated investment strategy
will be held in cash or cash equivalents. The Fund seeks to produce a high
level of current income and gains through premiums received from writing
options and, to a lesser extent, from dividends. There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The Fund's investment
objectives are considered fundamental and may not be changed without
shareholder approval.

Note 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") established the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification(TM) ("ASC") as the single source of
authoritative accounting principles reorganized by the FASB in preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The ASC superseded existing
non-grandfathered, non-U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
accounting and reporting standards. The ASC did not change GAAP but rather
organized it into a hierarchy where all guidance with the ASC carried an equal
level of authority. The ASC became effective for financial statements issued
for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The
implementation of ASC did not have a material effect of the Fund's financial
statements

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund.

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Readily marketable portfolio securities listed on an exchange or traded in the
over-the-counter market are generally valued at their last reported sale price.
If no sales are reported, the securities are valued at the mean of the closing
bid and asked prices on such day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such
day, then the security is valued by such method as the Fund's Board of Trustees
shall determine in good faith to reflect its fair value. Securities traded on
NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. Portfolio securities
traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price
at the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such
securities. Debt securities are valued at the last available bid price for such
securities or, if such prices are not available, at the mean between the last
bid and asked price. Exchange-traded options are valued at the mean of the best
bid and best asked prices across all option exchanges. Short-term debt
securities having a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at
amortized cost, which approximates market value.

For those securities whose bid or asked prices are not available, the
valuations are determined in accordance with procedures established in good
faith by the Board of Trustees. Valuations in accordance with these procedures
are intended to reflect each security's (or asset's) "fair value". Such "fair
value" is the amount that the Fund might reasonably expect to receive for the
security (or asset) upon its current sale. Each such determination should be
based on a consideration of all relevant factors, which are likely to vary from
one pricing context to another. Examples of such factors may include, but are
not limited to: (i) the type of security, (ii) the initial cost of the
security, (iii) the existence of any contractual restrictions on the security's
disposition, (iv) the price and extent of public trading in similar securities
of the issuer or of comparable companies, (v) quotations or evaluated prices
from broker-dealers and/or pricing services, (vi) information obtained from the
issuer, analysts, and/or the appropriate stock exchange (for exchange traded
securities), (vii) an analysis of the company's financial statements, and
(viii) an evaluation of the forces that influence the issuer and the market(s)
in which the security is purchased and sold (e.g. the existence of pending
merger activity, public offerings or tender offers that might affect the value
of the security).

The Fund adopted ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820")
(formerly known as the Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS") No.
157). In accordance with ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that the
Fund would receive to sell an investment or pay to transfer a liability in an
orderly transaction with an independent buyer in the principal market, or in
the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market for the
investment or liability. ASC 820 establishes three different categories for
valuations. Level 1 valuations are those based upon quoted prices in active
markets. Level 2 valuations are those based upon quoted prices in inactive
markets or based upon significant observable inputs (e.g. yield curves;
benchmark interest rates; indices). Level 3 valuations are those based upon
unobservable

inputs (e.g. discounted cash flow analysis; non-market based methods used to
determine fair valuation). The following table represents the Fund's
investments carried on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities by caption and
by level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2009:

=======================================================================

(b) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income is recorded net of applicable withholding taxes on the ex-dividend date
and interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts or premiums on
debt securities purchased are accreted or amortized to interest income over the
lives of the respective securities using the effective interest method.

To earn greater income on otherwise uninvested cash temporarily held by the
Fund, such as income earned from stock sold or called away, stock dividends and
covered call writing premiums, the Fund may invest such cash in repurchase
agreements. Repurchase agreements are short-term investments in which the Fund
acquires ownership of a debt security and the seller agrees to repurchase the
security at a future time and specified price. Repurchase agreements are fully
collateralized by the underlying debt security. The Fund will make payment for
such securities only upon physical delivery or evidence of book entry transfer
to the account of the custodian bank. The seller is required to maintain the
value of the underlying security at not less than the repurchase proceeds due
the Fund.

(c) OPTIONS
The Fund will pursue its primary objective by employing an option strategy of
writing (selling) covered call options on common stocks. The Fund seeks to
generate current gains from option premiums as a means to enhance distributions
payable to the Fund's common shareholders.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability and is subsequently marked to market to reflect the current
market value of the option written. These liabilities are reflected as options
written in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Premiums received from
writing options which expire unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as
a realized gain. The difference between the premium received and the amount
paid on effecting a closing purchase transaction, including brokerage
commissions, is also treated as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than
the amount paid for the closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a
call option is exercised; the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of
the underlying security in determining whether there has been a realized gain
or loss.

(d) DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
The Fund declares and pays quarterly dividends to common shareholders.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount
and timing of distributions are determined in accordance with federal income
tax regulations, which may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. These dividends consist of investment company taxable income, which
generally includes qualified dividend income, ordinary income and short-term
capital gains, including premiums received on written options. Realized
short-term capital gains are considered ordinary income for tax purposes and
will be reclassified at the Fund's fiscal year end on the Fund's Statement of
Assets and Liabilities from accumulated net realized gains to distributions in
excess of net investment income. Any net realized long-term capital gains are
distributed annually to common shareholders.

(e) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Fund has adopted ASC 855, Subsequent Events ("ASC 855") (formerly known as
SFAS No. 165). ASC 855 requires an entity to recognize in the financial
statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional
evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the statement of assets
and liabilities. ASC 855 is intended to establish general standards of
accounting and for disclosure of events that occur after the statement of
assets and liabilities date but before the financial statements are issued or
are available to be issued. The Fund has performed an evaluation of subsequent
events through February 24 2010, which is the date the financial statements
were issued.

Note 3 -- INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND
OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES:
Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") between
the Fund and Claymore Advisors, LLC (the "Adviser"), the Adviser furnishes
offices, necessary facilities and equipment; provides certain administrative
services; oversees the activities of Madison Asset Management LLC (the
"Investment Manager"); and provides personnel, including certain officers
required for the Fund's administrative management and compensates all officers
and trustees of the Fund who are its affiliates. As compensation for these
services, the Fund pays the Adviser a fee, payable monthly, in an amount equal
to 0.50% of the Fund's average daily managed assets. Managed assets equal the
net assets of the Fund plus any assets attributable to financial leverage.

Pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement between the Fund and the
Investment Manager, the Investment Manager, under the supervision of the Fund's
Board of Trustees and the Adviser, provides a continuous investment program for
the Fund's portfolio; provides investment research and makes and executes
recommendations for the purchase and sale of securities; and provides certain
facilities and personnel, including officers required for the Fund's
administrative management and compensation of all officers and trustees of the
Fund who are its affiliates. As compensation for these services, the Fund pays
the Investment Manager a fee, payable monthly, in an amount equal to 0.50% of
the Fund's average daily managed assets.

On July 17, 2009, Claymore Group Inc., the parent of the Adviser, entered into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger between and among Claymore Group Inc., Claymore
Holdings, LLC and GuggClay Acquisition, Inc., (with the latter two entities
being wholly-owned, indirect subsidiaries of Guggenheim Partners, LLC
("Guggenheim")) whereby GuggClay Acquisition, Inc. merged into Claymore Group
Inc. which is the surviving entity. This transaction was completed on October
14, 2009 (the "Effective Date") and resulted in a change-of-control whereby
Claymore Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, including the Adviser, became
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of Guggenheim. The transaction is not
expected to affect the daily operations of the Fund or the investment
management activities of the Adviser.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (the "1940 Act"), the
consummation of this transaction resulted in the automatic termination of the
Advisory & Investment Management Agreements. Accordingly, on September 23,
2009, the Board of Trustees approved an interim investment advisory agreement
between the Fund and the Adviser (the "Interim Advisory Agreement") and an
interim investment management agreement among the Fund, the Adviser and Madison
Asset Management, LLC (the "Interim Investment Management Agreement" and
together with the Interim Advisory Agreement, the "Interim Agreements"). The
Interim Agreements took effect as of the Effective Date.

On September 23, 2009, the Board of Trustees approved a new investment advisory
agreement between the Fund and the Adviser (the "New Advisory Agreement") and a
new investment management agreement among the Fund, the Adviser and the
Investment Manager (the "New Investment Management Agreement" and together with
the New Advisory Agreement, the "New Agreements") and recommended that the New
Agreements be submitted to the shareholders of the Fund for their approval. On
February 2, 2010, shareholders approved the New Agreements and therefore the
Interim Agreements terminated. The New Agreements will have an initial term of
one year. Thereafter, the New Agreements will continue in effect only if their
continuance is approved annually by the Board of Trustees. Other than effective
dates, there are no material differences between the terms of the New
Agreements and those of the original Advisory Agreement and Investment
Management Agreement.

Under separate Fund Administration and Fund Accounting agreements, the Adviser
provides fund administration services and the Investment Manager provides fund
accounting services to the Fund. The Adviser receives a fund administration fee
payable monthly at the annual rate set forth below as a percentage of the
average daily managed assets of the Fund:

MANAGED ASSETS                RATE
==================================
First $200,000,000         0.0275%
Next $300,000,000          0.0175%
Next $500,000,000          0.0125%
Over $1,000,000,000        0.0100%

The Investment Manager receives a fund accounting fee based on the net assets
of the Fund and the Madison Strategic Sector Premium Fund, a closed-end
investment company sponsored by the Investment Manager. The fund accounting fee
is allocated on a prorated basis of the net assets of each fund. This fee is
payable monthly at the annual rate set forth below as a percentage of the
average daily net assets of the two funds:

NET ASSETS                    RATE
==================================
First $200,000,000         0.0275%
Next $300,000,000          0.0200%
Next $500,000,000          0.0150%
Over $1,000,000,000        0.0100%

The Bank of New York Mellon ("BNY") acts as the Fund's custodian and transfer
agent. As custodian, BNY is responsible for the custody of the Fund's assets.
As transfer agent, BNY is responsible for performing transfer agency services
for the Fund.

STATEMENTS continued

Certain officers and trustees of the Fund are also officers and directors of
Claymore Advisors, LLC or Madison Asset Management LLC. The Fund does not
compensate its officers or trustees who are officers or interested persons of
the two aforementioned firms.

Note 4 -- FEDERAL INCOME TAXES:
The Fund intends to comply with the requirements of Subchapter M of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, applicable to regulated investment
companies. Accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal income taxes is required.
In addition, by distributing substantially all of its ordinary income and
long-term capital gains, if any, during each calendar year, the Fund intends
not to be subject to U.S. federal excise tax.

Due to inherent differences in the recognition of income, expenses, and
realized gains/losses under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and
federal income tax purposes, permanent differences between book and tax basis
reporting have been identified and appropriately reclassified on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities. A permanent book and tax difference relating to a
distribution reclass in the amount of $15,340,759 was reclassified from net
investment loss to accumulated net realized gain. Finally, a permanent book and
tax difference relating to net operating losses in the amount of $927,639 was
reclassified from net investment loss to accumulated net realized gain. Net
realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax reporting
primarily as a result of the deferral of losses relating to wash sale and
straddle transactions.

Information on the tax components of investments, excluding written options, as
of December 31, 2009 is as follows:

Capital losses incurred after October 31 ("post-October" losses) within the
taxable year are deemed to arise on the first business day of the Fund's next
taxable year. The Fund incurred and will elect to defer capital losses of
$3,075,359.

At December 31, 2009, for federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital
loss carryforward of $7,813,335 available to offset possible future capital
gains. Of the capital loss carrryforward, $7,813,335 is set to expire on
December 31, 2017.

For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, the tax character of
distributions paid to common shareholders as reflected in the statement of
changes in net assets was as follows:

DISTRIBUTIONS PAID FROM:           2009           2008
======================================================
Ordinary income          $   15,340,759 $   22,736,739

======================================================

For all open tax years and all major jurisdictions, management of the Fund has
concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions that would
require recognition in the financial statements. Open tax years are those that
are open for examination by taxing authorities (i.e. generally the last four
tax year ends and the interim tax period since them). Furthermore, management
of the fund is also not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably
possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
change in the next twelve months.

Note 5 -- INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES:
During the year ended December 31, 2009, the cost of purchases and proceeds
from sales of investments, excluding written options and short-term
investments, were $25,379,164 and $67,184,671, respectively.

Note 6 -- DERIVATIVES:
An option on a security is a contract that gives the holder of the option, in
return for a premium, the right to buy from (in the case of a call) or sell to
(in the case of a put) the writer of the option the security underlying the
option at a specified exercise or "strike" price. The writer of an option on a
security has an obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver the
underlying security upon payment of the exercise price (in the case of a call)
or to pay the exercise price upon delivery of the underlying security (in the
case of a put).

MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund | NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS continued

COVERED CALL OPTIONS
There are several risks associated with transactions in options on securities.
As the writer of a covered call option, the Fund forgoes, during the option's
life, the opportunity to profit from increases in the market value of the
security covering the call option above the sum of the premium and the strike
price of the call but has retained the risk of loss should the price of the
underlying security decline. A writer of a put option is exposed to the risk of
loss if fair value of the underlying securities declines, but profits only to
the extent of the premium received if the underlying security increases in
value. The writer of an option has no control over the time when it may be
required to fill its obligation as writer of the option. Once an option writer
has received an exercise notice, it cannot effect a closing purchase
transaction in order to terminate its obligation under the option and must
deliver the underlying security at the exercise price.

Transactions in written option contracts during the year ended December 31,
2009 were as follows:
                                             NUMBER OF                PREMIUMS

The Fund adopted ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (formerly known as FAS No.
161), effective January 1, 2009. ASC 815 is intended to improve financial
reporting about derivative instruments by requiring enhanced disclosures to
enable investors to better understand: a) how and why a fund uses derivative
instruments, b) how derivatives instruments and related hedge fund items are
accounted for, and c) how derivative instruments and related hedge items affect
a fund's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The following table presents the types of derivatives in the Fund by location as
presented on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2009:

MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund | NOTES TO FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS continued

Note 7 -- CAPITAL:

COMMON SHARES
The Fund has an unlimited amount of common shares, $0.01 par value authorized
and 19,268,423 issued and outstanding.

There were no transactions in common shares during the years ended December 31,
2009 and December 31, 2008.

Note 8 -- BORROWINGS:
On April 30, 2008, the Fund entered into a $50,000,000 Revolving Credit
Agreement with M&I Marshall & Ilsley Bank, which provides for a revolving
credit facility to be used as leverage for the Fund. Effective April 30, 2009,
the $50,000,000 revolving credit agreement was reduced to $30,000,000. The
credit facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund
assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. The Fund may borrow up to
the lesser of the amount of the revolving credit facility or 20% of the Fund's
total assets (including the proceeds of such financial leverage). Interest on
the amount borrowed is based on the 1-month LIBOR plus 2.41% with a minimum
annual rate of 4.00%. An unused commitment fee of 0.10% is charged on the
difference between the $30,000,000 credit agreement and the amount borrowed,
which is included in "Line of credit fees" on the Statement of Operations. As
of December 31, 2009, there was $0 outstanding in connection with the Fund's
credit facility. The average daily amount of the borrowings on the credit
facility during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $11,769,863 with a related
average interest rate of 2.75%. The maximum amount outstanding during the
period was $24,000,000. The maturity date for the Revolving Credit Agreement is
April 30, 2010.

Note 9 -- INDEMNIFICATIONS:
In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that provide
general indemnifications. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements
is dependent upon claims that may be made against the Fund in the future, and,
therefore cannot be estimated; however, the risk of material loss from such
claims is considered remote.

Note 10 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT:
On February 1, 2010, the Board of Trustees declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.18 per common share. The dividend is payable February 26, 2010 to
shareholders of record on February 12, 2010.

Note 11 -- RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
On January 21, 2010, the FASB issued an ASU, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures (Topic 820): Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements
which provides guidance on how investment assets and liabilities are to be
valued and disclosed. Specifically, the amendment requires reporting entities
to disclose i) the input and valuation techniques used to measure fair value
for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements, for Level 2 or
Level 3 positions ii) transfers between all levels (including Level 1 and Level
2) will be required to be disclosed on a gross basis (i.e. transfers out must
be disclosed separately from transfers in) as well as the reason(s) for the
transfer and iii) purchases, sales, issuances and settlements must be shown on
a gross basis in the Level 3 rollforward rather than as one net number. The
effective date of the amendment is for interim and annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2009 however, the requirement to provide the Level 3
activity for purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis will
be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2010.
At this time the Fund is evaluating the implications of the amendment to ASC
820 and the impact to the financial statements.

Report of INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM|

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF
MADISON/CLAYMORE COVERED CALL & EQUITY STRATEGY FUND

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the Fund), including the
portfolio of investments, as of December 31, 2009, and the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial statements
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2009, by correspondence
with the custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures
where replies from brokers were not received. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund at December 31, 2009, and
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net
assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

Dividend Reinvestment PLAN | (unaudited)

Unless the registered owner of common shares elects to receive cash by
contacting the Plan Administrator, all dividends declared on common shares of
the Fund will be automatically reinvested by the Bank of New York Mellon (the
"Plan Administrator"), administrator for shareholders in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), in additional common shares of the Fund.
Participation in the Plan is completely voluntary and may be terminated or
resumed at any time without penalty by notice if received and processed by the
Plan Administrator prior to the dividend record date; otherwise such
termination or resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently
declared dividend or other distribution. Some brokers may automatically elect
to receive cash on your behalf and may re-invest that cash in additional common
shares of the Fund for you. If you wish for all dividends declared on your
common shares of the Fund to be automatically reinvested pursuant to the Plan,
please contact your broker.

The Plan Administrator will open an account for each common shareholder under
the Plan in the same name in which such common shareholder's common shares are
registered. Whenever the Fund declares a dividend or other distribution
(together, a "Dividend") payable in cash, non-participants in the Plan will
receive cash and participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in common
shares. The common shares will be acquired by the Plan Administrator for the
participants' accounts, depending upon the circumstances described below,
either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but authorized common shares
from the Fund ("Newly Issued Common Shares") or (ii) by purchase of outstanding
common shares on the open market ("Open-Market Purchases") on the New York
Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the
closing market price plus estimated brokerage commission per common share is
equal to or greater than the net asset value per common share, the Plan
Administrator will invest the Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares on
behalf of the participants. The number of Newly Issued Common Shares to be
credited to each participant's account will be determined by dividing the
dollar amount of the Dividend by the net asset value per common share on the
payment date; provided that, if the net asset value is less than or equal to
95% of the closing market value on the payment date, the dollar amount of the
Dividend will be divided by 95% of the closing market price per common share on
the payment date. If, on the payment date for any Dividend, the net asset value
per common share is greater than the closing market value plus estimated
brokerage commission, the Plan Administrator will invest the Dividend amount in
common shares acquired on behalf of the participants in Open-Market Purchases.

If, before the Plan Administrator has completed its Open-Market Purchases, the
market price per common share exceeds the net asset value per common share, the
average per common share purchase price paid by the Plan Administrator may
exceed the net asset value of the common shares, resulting in the acquisition
of fewer common shares than if the Dividend had been paid in Newly Issued
Common Shares on the Dividend payment date. Because of the foregoing difficulty
with respect to Open-Market Purchases, the Plan provides that if the Plan
Administrator is unable to invest the full Dividend amount in Open-Market
Purchases during the purchase period or if the market discount shifts to a
market premium during the purchase period, the Plan Administrator may cease
making Open-Market Purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the
Dividend amount in Newly Issued Common Shares at net asset value per common
share at the close of business on the last purchase date provided that, if the
net asset value is less than or equal to 95% of the then current market price
per common share; the dollar amount of the Dividend will be divided by 95% of
the market price on the payment date.

The Plan Administrator maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and
furnishes written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including
information needed by shareholders for tax records. Common shares in the
account of each Plan participant will be held by the Plan Administrator on
behalf of the Plan participant, and each shareholder proxy will include those
shares purchased or received pursuant to the Plan. The Plan Administrator will
forward all proxy solicitation materials to participants and vote proxies for
shares held under the Plan in accordance with the instruction of the
participants.

There will be no brokerage charges with respect to common shares issued
directly by the Fund. However, each participant will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commission incurred in connection with Open-Market Purchases. The
automatic reinvestment of Dividends will not relieve participants of any
Federal, state or local income tax that may be payable (or required to be
withheld) on such Dividends.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan. There is no direct
service charge to participants with regard to purchases in the Plan; however,
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants.

All correspondence or questions concerning the Plan should be directed to the
Plan Administrator, BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, PO Box 358015, Pittsburgh,
PA 15252-8015, Phone Number: (866) 488-3559.

Board Considerations Regarding Contract Approvals of the Interim and New
Investment Advisory Agreements and Interim and New Investment Management
Agreements

On September 23, 2009, the Board of Trustees (the "Board") of the
Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund (the "Fund"), including
those trustees who are not "interested persons" as defined by the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (the "Independent Trustees"), on the recommendation of the
Nominating & Governance Committee (referred to as the "Committee" and
consisting solely of the Independent Trustees) of the Board of the Fund,
approved: (1) an interim ("Interim Advisory Agreement") and new ("New Advisory
Agreement") advisory agreement (together, the "Investment Advisory Agreements")
between the Fund and Claymore Advisors, LLC ("Adviser") and (2) an interim
("Interim Investment Management Agreement") and new ("New Investment Management
Agreement") investment management agreement (together the "Investment
Management Agreements") among the Adviser, the Fund and Madison Asset
Management, LLC ("Investment Manager"). (The Investment Advisory Agreements and
the Investment Management Agreements are together referred to as the "Advisory
Agreements.") As part of its review process, the Committee was represented by
independent legal counsel.

Based upon its review, the Board and the Committee concluded that it was in the
best interest of the Fund to approve each of the Advisory Agreements. In
reaching this conclusion for the Fund, no single factor was determinative in
the Board's analysis, but rather the Board considered a variety of factors.

INTERIM ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND NEW ADVISORY AGREEMENT
The Board reviewed materials received from the Adviser, Guggenheim Partners,
LLC ("Guggenheim") and independent legal counsel. The Board also had previously
received, throughout the year, Board meeting information regarding performance
and operating results of the Fund. Earlier this year, the Adviser informed the
Board that it was in discussions with Guggenheim concerning a strategic
transaction, including a potential sale of a controlling interest in the
Adviser (the "Transaction"). The Adviser provided periodic reports to
representatives of the Board as to the status and nature of such discussions
with Guggenheim and the Adviser's operating and financial results. In the
spring of 2009, the Adviser informed the Board that Guggenheim had arranged up
to $20 million of subordinated loans to Claymore Group as interim financing for
working capital and for inventory purchases in connection with its business of
creating, distributing and supervising unit investment trusts and other
investment products.

Following the execution of a merger agreement between Claymore and Guggenheim
(the "Merger Agreement"), a telephonic meeting was held on July 28, 2009, and
attended by certain members of the Board, the chief executive officer of
Claymore Group and the chief executive officer of Guggenheim. Such executive
officers summarized the principal terms of the Merger Agreement, and described
the Transaction, the business plans for the Adviser following the consummation
of the Transaction and answered such questions as were raised at the meeting.
Representatives of the Board requested additional information regarding the
Transaction, Guggenheim and the impact of the Transaction on the Shareholders
of the Fund.

During the third quarter of 2009, the Committee received reports on the
progress of the Transaction, including the debt financing and additional equity
financing arranged by Guggenheim. As part of its review process, the Committee
was represented by independent legal counsel. The Committee reviewed materials
received from the Adviser, Guggenheim and independent legal counsel. The Adviser
and Guggenheim provided, among other information, information regarding the
terms of the Transaction and potential benefits to the Adviser from the
Transaction. The information provided regarding Guggenheim included (i)
financial information, (ii) information regarding senior executives of the firm,
(iii) information regarding other Guggenheim affiliated investment managers,
(iv) information regarding litigation and regulatory matters and (v) potential
conflicts of interest. The Adviser and Guggenheim also provided information
regarding Guggenheim's and the Adviser's intentions for the business, operations
and personnel of the Adviser following the closing of the Transaction. The
Committee met and discussed the Transaction and the Interim Advisory Agreement
and the New Advisory Agreement in September 2009. Additional supplemental
information regarding the Transaction and Guggenheim was provided by the Adviser
and Guggenheim and reviewed by the Committee.

Subsequent to these meetings, the Board met in person to consider the Interim
Advisory Agreement and the New Advisory Agreement at a meeting held on
September 23, 2009. The Board met with representatives of the Adviser and
Guggenheim to discuss the Transaction. Representatives from the Adviser and
Guggenheim discussed the Transaction with, and answered questions from, the
Board. The Committee met in executive session to discuss the Transaction and
the information provided at the Board meeting. The Committee concluded that it
was in the best interest of the Fund to approve the Interim Advisory Agreement
and New Advisory Agreement and, accordingly, recommended to the Board the
approval of the Interim Advisory Agreement and New Advisory Agreement. The
Board subsequently approved the Interim Advisory Agreement and approved the New
Advisory Agreement for a one-year term. The Board also determined to consider
the continuation of the agreement during the course of the one-year term by
conducting a thorough review of the various information that is part of the
Board's regular annual consideration of the continuation of the Fund's advisory
agreement. In reaching the conclusion to approve the Interim Advisory Agreement
and New Advisory Agreement, no single factor was determinative in the Board's
analysis, but rather the Board considered a variety of factors. Provided below
is an overview of the primary factors the Board considered in connection with
the review of the Interim Advisory Agreement and the New Advisory Agreement.

In connection with the Board's consideration of the Interim Advisory Agreement
and the New Advisory Agreement, the Trustees considered, among other
information, the following factors:

     o    within the last year, the Board had engaged in a thorough review of
          the various factors, including fees and performance, that are part of
          the decision whether to continue an advisory agreement;

     o    Board approval of the Fund's Investment Advisory Agreements was a
          condition to the closing of the Transaction;

     o    Claymore's statement to the Board that the manner in which the Fund's
          assets are managed will not change as a result of the Transaction;

     o    the aggregate advisory fee rate payable by the Fund will not change
          under the Interim Advisory Agreement or New Advisory Agreement;

     o    there are no material differences between the terms of the Interim
          Advisory Agreement and New Advisory Agreement and the terms of the
          Fund's prior advisory agreement, except for those provisions in the
          Interim Advisory Agreement which are necessary to comply with Rule
          15a-4 under the 1940 Act;

     o    the capabilities of the Adviser's personnel who will provide advisory
          (if applicable), management, shareholder servicing and
          administrative services to the Fund are not expected to change, and
          the key personnel who currently provide advisory (if applicable),
          management, shareholder servicing and administrative services to the
          Fund are expected to continue to do so after the Transaction;

     o    the assurance from the Adviser and Guggenheim that following the
          Transaction there will not be any diminution in the nature, quality
          and extent of services provided to the Fund;

     o    the Adviser's current financial condition;


28 | Annual Report | December 31, 2009

<PAGE>
MCN | Madison/Claymore Covered Call & Equity Strategy Fund | BOARD
CONSIDERATIONS continued

     o    the impact of the Transaction on the Adviser's day-to-day operations;

     o    the reputation, capabilities, experience, organizational structure and
          financial resources of Guggenheim;

     o    the long-term business goals of Guggenheim and the Adviser with regard
          to the business and operations of the Adviser;

     o    that Shareholders of the Fund will not bear any costs in connection
          with the Transaction, inasmuch as the Adviser will bear the costs,
          fees and expenses incurred by the Fund in connection with the Fund's
          Proxy Statement and any other costs of the Fund associated with the
          Transaction; and

     o    that the Adviser and relevant acquisition subsidiaries have agreed to
          refrain from imposing or seeking to impose, for a period of two years
          after the Closing, any "unfair burden"(within the meaning of Section
          15(f) of 1940 Act) on the Fund.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided by the Adviser. The Board noted
that key management personnel servicing the Fund are expected to remain with
the Adviser following the Transaction and that the services provided to the
Fund by the Adviser are not expected to change. The Board also considered the
Adviser's and Guggenheim's representations to the Board that Guggenheim intends
for the Adviser to continue to operate following the closing of the Transaction
in much the same manner as it operates today, and that the impact of the
Transaction on the day-to-day operations of the Adviser would be neutral or
positive. The Board also considered Guggenheim's statement that the Adviser's
compliance policies and procedures, disaster recovery plans, information
security controls and insurance program would not change materially following
consummation of the Transaction. Based on this review, the Board concluded that
the range and quality of services provided by the Adviser to the Fund were
expected to continue under the Interim Advisory Agreement and the New Advisory
Agreement at the same or improved levels.

Advisory Fees. The Board also considered the fact that the advisory fee rates
payable to the Adviser would be the same under the Interim Advisory Agreement
and New Advisory Agreement as they are under the Fund's prior advisory
agreement, which had within the last year been determined to be reasonable. The
Board concluded that these factors supported approval of the Interim Advisory
Agreement and New Advisory Agreement.

Performance. With respect to the performance of the Fund, the Board considered
that, the Investment Manager would continue to manage the Fund's portfolio
following the closing of the Transaction, subject to Shareholder approval of
the New Investment Management Agreement. The Board concluded that these factors
supported approval of the Interim Advisory Agreement and New Advisory
Agreement.

Profitability. The Board noted that it was too early to predict how the
Transaction may affect the Adviser's future profitability from its relationship
with the Fund, but concluded that this matter would be given further
consideration on an annual basis going forward. The Board also noted that the
Adviser's fee rates under the Interim Advisory Agreement and New Advisory
Agreement are the same as those assessed under the Fund's prior advisory
agreement.

Economies of Scale. The Board considered any potential economies of scale that
may result from the Transaction. The Board further noted Guggenheim's statement
that such economies of scale could not be predicted in advance of the closing
of the Transaction.

Other Benefits. The Board noted its prior determination that the advisory fees
were reasonable, taking into consideration other benefits to the Adviser
(including the receipt by Claymore of an administrative fee). The Board also
considered other benefits to the Adviser, Guggenheim and their affiliates
expected to be derived from their relationships with the Fund as a result of
the Transaction and noted that no additional benefits were reported by the
Adviser or Guggenheim as a result of the Transaction. Therefore, the Board
concluded that the advisory fees continued to be reasonable, taking into
consideration other benefits.

NEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT AND INTERIM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
AGREEMENT
In conjunction with the consideration of the Transaction and the approval of a
New Advisory Agreement and Interim Advisory Agreement, the Board, including the
Independent Trustees, also considered the Fund's New Investment Management
Agreement and Interim Investment Management Agreement. The Board noted that
while the closing of the Transaction would result in the termination of the
prior investment management agreement pursuant to its terms, the Investment
Manager was not a party to the Transaction and the operations of the Investment
Manager and the services to be provided by the Investment Manager would be
unaffected by the Transaction.

The Board determined that there were no material differences between the terms
of the Interim Investment Management Agreement and the corresponding prior
investment management agreement, except with respect to those provisions
required to comply with Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act, and that there were no
material differences between the terms of the New Investment Management
Agreement and the prior investment management agreement. The Board noted that
the compensation to be received by the Investment Manager under the Interim
Investment Management Agreement and New Investment Management Agreement is not
greater than the compensation the Investment Manager would have received under
the prior investment management agreement. The Board noted that the scope and
quality of services to be provided to the Fund under the Interim Investment
Management Agreement and New Investment Management Agreement would be at least
equivalent to the scope and quality of services provided under the prior
investment management agreement. The Board noted that, within the last year, it
had engaged in a thorough review of the various factors, including fees and
performance, that are part of the evaluation of the renewal or approval of an
investment management agreement.

The Board noted that the factors previously considered with respect to approval
of the prior investment management agreement continued to support the approval
of the New Investment Management Agreement and Interim Investment Management
Agreement. The Board also determined to consider such factors again within one
year of the execution of the New Investment Management Agreement. Based upon
its review, the Board concluded that it was in the best interest of the Fund to
approve the New Investment Management Agreement and Interim Investment
Management Agreement.

OVERALL CONCLUSIONS
Based upon all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board determined that the terms of the Advisory Agreements are fair and
reasonable and that approval of the Advisory Agreements is in the best
interests of the Fund.

About the FUND MANAGER|

MADISON ASSET MANAGEMENT, LLC

Madison Asset Management, LLC, (MAM) a subsidiary of Madison Investment
Advisors, Inc., with its affiliates, manages in excess of $15 billion in
individual, corporate, pension, insurance, endowment and mutual fund assets as
of December 31, 2009.

INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

MAM believes in investing in high-quality growth companies, which deliver
potentially consistent and sustainable earnings growth, yet sell at attractive
valuations. Historically, shareholders of these types of companies have been
rewarded over the long term with above-average returns, and favorable risk
characteristics. Constructing portfolios with positive risk/reward profiles has
historically allowed clients to participate during strong market environments,
while mitigating potential declines.

INVESTMENT PROCESS

The managers employ a fundamental, bottom-up strategy in constructing equity
portfolios. The managers look for companies that they believe are consistently
growing at an above-average pace, yet sell at below-average multiple.

The managers follow a rigorous three-step process when evaluating companies and
then employ an actively-managed option strategy to help enhance income and
mitigate downside risk.

1.   BUSINESS MODEL. The managers look for a sustainable competitive advantage,
     cash flow that is both predictable and growing, as well as a rock-solid
     balance sheet.

2.   MANAGEMENT. When assessing management, the managers look to see how the
     company has allocated capital in the past, their track record for enhancing
     shareholder value and the nature of their accounting practices.

3.   PROPER VALUATION. The final step in the process is assessing the proper
     valuation for the company. The managers strive to purchase securities
     trading at a discount to their intrinsic value as determined by discounted
     cash flows. They corroborate this valuation work with additional valuation
     methodologies.

The covered call investment strategy focuses on stocks in which the managers
have high confidence in their continuing earnings growth rates, but sell at
reasonable Price-Earnings Ratios. By writing the majority of the Fund's calls
out-of-the-money, meaning the strike price is higher than the stock price, the
Fund can participate in some stock appreciation while still receiving income in
the form of option premiums. The covered call strategy also tends to reduce the
risk compared to just owning the stock.

by the report presented in Item 1 hereto.

committee financial expert serving on its audit committee (the "Audit
Committee"), Randall C. Barnes. Mr. Barnes is an "independent" Trustee for
purposes of this Item 3 of Form N-CSR. Mr. Barnes qualifies as an audit
committee financial expert by virtue of his experience obtained as a former
Senior Vice President, Treasurer of PepsiCo, Inc.

(Under applicable securities laws, a person who is determined to be an audit
committee financial expert will not be deemed an "expert" for any purpose,
including without limitation for the purposes of Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, as a result of being designated or identified as an
audit committee financial expert. The designation or identification of a person
as an audit committee financial expert does not impose on such person any
duties, obligations, or liabilities that are greater than the duties,
obligations, and liabilities imposed on such person as a member of the Audit
Committee and Board of Trustees in the absence of such designation or
identification. The designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert does not affect the duties, obligations or liability
of any other member of the Audit Committee or Board of Trustees.)

MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST THAT MAY ARISE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MANAGER'S
MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENTS AND THE INVESTMENTS OF THE OTHER ACCOUNTS:
Note that of the four funds managed, the Madison Institutional Equity Option
Fund, an open-end series of Madison Mosaic Equity Trust ("MADOX"), with
investment strategies similar to the Trust, contains a fulcrum fee that rewards
the adviser to the Trust if MADOX outperforms the BXM Index and penalizes the
adviser for underperforming such index. As of the date of this filing, MADOX
assets were approximately $4 million. The adviser's compliance program includes
procedures to monitor trades by MADOX, the Trust and other funds managed by the
portfolio manager. In addition, potential conflicts of interest may arise
because the adviser engages in portfolio management activities for clients other
than the funds. However, Madison has adopted a variety of portfolio security
aggregation and allocation policies which are designed to provide reasonable
assurance that buy and sell opportunities are allocated fairly among clients.

<PAGE>

(a) (3) Compensation.

The adviser believes investment professionals should receive compensation for
the performance of the firm's client accounts, their individual effort, and the
overall profitability of the firm. As such, investment professionals receive a
base salary, as well as an incentive bonus based on the attainment of certain
goals and objectives in the portfolio management process (described below). The
manager also participates in the overall profitability of the firm directly,
through an ownership interest in the firm, or indirectly, through a
firm-sponsored profit sharing plan. The adviser believes its portfolio managers'
goals are aligned with those of long-term investors, recognizing client goals to
outperform over the long-term, rather than focused on short-term performance
contests.

With regard to incentive compensation, the incentive pools are calculated based
on revenue from each investment strategy. Managers are rewarded for performance
relative to their benchmark(s) over both one and three year periods. Incentive
compensation earned is paid out over a three year period, so that if a portfolio
manager leaves the employ of the Madison organization, he or she forfeits a
percentage of his or her incentive compensation. The purpose of this structured
payout is to aid in the retention of investment personnel. With the exception of
Mr. Burgess, all investment professionals are eligible to participate in the
incentive compensation pool.

The incentive compensation pool shared by the members of the firm's equity
management team (all portfolio managers listed above except Mr. Burgess) is
based on the performance of the firm's various equity composites measured
against the appropriate index benchmarks. All firm equity accounts, including
mutual funds, regardless of whether they are included in such composites, are
managed with the same general investment philosophy, approach and applicable
allocations, quality and other portfolio characteristics.

There is no difference in terms of the way the firm compensates portfolio
managers for managing a mutual fund or a private client account (or any other
type of account for that matter). Instead, compensation is based on the entire

                                 CLAYMORE FUNDS

                                 CODE OF ETHICS
                                       FOR
                  CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

         Each of the registered investment companies listed in Appendix A hereto
(each a "Trust") is committed to conducting business in accordance with
applicable laws, rules and regulations and the highest standards of business
ethics, and to full and accurate financial disclosure in compliance with
applicable law. This Code of Ethics, applicable to the Trust's Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons performing similar
functions) (together, "Senior Officers"), sets forth specific policies to guide
you in the performance of your duties.

         As a Senior Officer, you must comply with applicable law. You also have
a responsibility to conduct yourself in an honest and ethical manner; and you
have leadership responsibilities that include creating a culture of high ethical
standards and commitment to compliance, maintaining a work environment that
encourages employees to raise concerns, and promptly addressing employee
compliance concerns.

         The Code of Ethics of the Trust pursuant to Rule 17j-1(c) under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") (the "1940 Act Code
of Ethics"), which this Code of Ethics is intended to supplement, sets forth the
fundamental principles and key policies and procedures that govern the conduct
of all of us in our business as registered investment companies. You are also
bound by the requirements and standards set forth in this Code of Ethics and
other applicable laws and regulations and other policies and procedures adopted
by the Trust from time to time.

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

         You are required to comply with the laws, rules and regulations that
govern the conduct of our business and to report any suspected violations in
accordance with the section below entitled "Compliance with Code of Ethics."

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         Senior Officers are expected to dedicate their best efforts to
advancing the Trust's interests and to use objective and unbiased standards when
making decisions that affect the Trust, keeping in mind that you are subject to
inherent conflicts of interest because you are an officer of Claymore Advisors,
LLC (the "Adviser") as well as the Trust. Your obligation to conduct the Trust's
business in an honest and ethical manner includes the ethical handling of actual
or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and business relationships. A
conflict of interest for the purpose of this Code of Ethics occurs when your
private interests interfere in any way, or even appear to interfere, with the
interests of the Trust. The 1940 Act Code of Ethics, the Advisers' and the
Trust's allocation procedures and the other policies of the Trust are designed
to ensure the ethical handling of such conflicts. As a result, it is incumbent
on you to be familiar with the 1940 Act Code of Ethics, the Adviser's and
Trust's allocations procedures and other rules and regulations under the 1940
Act as well as the policies of the Trust. When making any investment, accepting
any position or benefits, participating in any transaction or business
arrangement or otherwise acting in a manner that creates or appears to create a
conflict of interest where you are

<PAGE>

receiving a personal benefit, you should act in accordance with the letter and
the spirit of the 1940 Act Code of Ethics and/or the Trust's or the Advisor's
other applicable policies and procedures. If you are in doubt as to the
application or interpretation of any of these, you should make full disclosure
of all facts and circumstances to, and obtain the prior written approval of the
Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust or, in his absence, any Independent
Trustee of the Trust.(1).

DISCLOSURES

         It is the policy of the Trust to make full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations
in all reports and documents that the Trust files with, or submits to, the
Securities and Exchange Commission and in all other public communications made
by the Trust. As a Senior Officer, you are required to promote compliance with
this policy by all employees and to abide by the Trust's standards, policies and
procedures designed to promote compliance with this policy.

COMPLIANCE WITH CODE OF ETHICS

         If you know of or suspect a violation of this Code of Ethics or other
laws, regulations, policies or procedures applicable to the Trust, you must
immediately report that information to the Chairman of the Audit Committee of
the Trust or, in his absence, any Independent Trustee of the Trust. No one will
be subject to retaliation because of a good faith report of a suspected
violation.

         The Trust will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code of Ethics, and in reporting on this Code of Ethics:

         o        the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust will take all
                  appropriate action to investigate any actual or potential
                  violations reported to him;

         o        violations and potential violations will be reported to the
                  Independent Trustees after such investigation;

         o        if the Independent Trustees determine that a violation has
                  occurred, they will take, or shall designate appropriate
                  persons to determine, appropriate action in response to
                  violations of this Code of Ethics; and

         o        appropriate action may include a letter of censure,
                  suspension, dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other
                  serious violations of law, notification of the Securities and
                  Exchange Commission or other appropriate law enforcement
                  authorities.

         Senior Officers must make this Code of Ethics known to persons who
might know of potential conflicts of interest, including any "whistle blower"
policies that the Trust may adopt from time to time.

WAIVERS OF CODE OF ETHICS

         Except as otherwise provided in this Code of Ethics, the Chairman of
the Audit Committee of the Trust is responsible for applying this Code of Ethics
to specific situations in which questions are presented to the Chairman of the
Audit Committee of the Trust and has the authority to

         person" of the Trust within the meaning of the 1940 Act.


<PAGE>

interpret this Code of Ethics in any particular situation. The Chairman of the
Audit Committee of the Trust shall take action he or she considers appropriate
to investigate any actual or potential violations reported under this Code of
Ethics.

         The Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Trust is authorized to
consult, as appropriate, with the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the
Trust, the Independent Trustees or the Board of Trustees and with counsel to the
Trust, Claymore or the Independent Trustees, and is encouraged to do so.

         The Independent Trustees are responsible for granting waivers of this
Code of Ethics, as appropriate. Any changes to or waivers of this Code of Ethics
will, to the extent required, be disclosed on Form N-CSR as provided by
Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

NO RIGHTS CREATED

         This Code of Ethics is a statement of certain fundamental principles,
policies and procedures that govern the Trust's Senior Officers in the conduct
of the Trust's business. It is not intended to and does not create any rights in
any employee, investor, supplier, competitor, shareholder or any other person or
entity.

<DESCRIPTION>PROXY VOTING POLICIES
<TEXT>
<PAGE>


                                                                     EXHIBIT (c)

                              PROXY VOTING POLICIES

Our policies regarding voting the proxies of securities held in client accounts
depend on the nature of our relationship to the client. When we are an ERISA
fiduciary of an account, there are additional considerations and procedures than
for all other (regular) accounts. In all cases, when we vote client proxies, we
must do so in the client's best interests as described below by these policies.

REGULAR ACCOUNTS

We do not assume the role of an active shareholder when managing client
accounts. If we are dissatisfied with the performance of a particular company,
we will generally reduce or terminate our position in the company rather than
attempt to force management changes through shareholder activism.

MAKING THE INITIAL DECISION ON HOW TO VOTE THE PROXY

As stated above, our goal and intent is to vote all proxies in the client's best
interests. For practical purposes, unless we make an affirmative decision to the
contrary, when we vote a proxy as the Board of Directors of a company
recommends, it means we agree with the Board that voting in such manner is in
the interests of our clients as shareholders of the company for the reasons
stated by the Board. However, if we believe that voting as the Board of
Directors recommends would not be in a client's best interests, then we must
vote against the Board's recommendation.

As a matter of standard operating procedure, all proxies received shall be voted
(by telephone or Internet or through a proxy voting service), unless we are not
authorized to vote proxies. When the client has reserved the right to vote
proxies in his/her/its account, we must make arrangements for proxies to be
delivered directly to such client from its custodian and, to the extent any such
proxies are received by us inadvertently, promptly forward them to the client.

DOCUMENTING OUR DECISIONS

In cases where a proxy will NOT be voted or, as described below, voted against
the Board of Directors recommendation, our policy is to make a notation to the
file containing the records for such security (e.g., Corporation X research
file, since we may receive numerous proxies for the same company and it is
impractical to keep such records in the file of each individual client)
explaining our action or inaction, as the case may be. Alternatively, or in
addition to such notation, we may include a copy of the rationale for such
decision in the appropriate equity correspondence file.

WHY WOULD VOTING AS THE BOARD RECOMMENDS NOT BE IN THE CLIENT'S BEST INTERESTS?
Portfolio management must, at a minimum, consider the following questions before
voting any proxy:

1. Is the Board of Directors recommending an action that could dilute or
otherwise diminish the value of our position? (This question is more complex
than it looks: We must consider the time frames involved for both the client and
the issuer. For example, if the Board of Directors is recommending an action
that might initially cause the position to lose value but will increase the
value of the position in the long-term, we would vote as the Board recommended
for if we are holding the security for clients as a long-term investment.
However, if the investment is close to our valuation limits and we are
anticipating eliminating the position in the short-term, then it would be in our
clients' best interests to vote against management's recommendation.)

<PAGE>

2. If so, would we be unable to liquidate the affected securities without
incurring a loss that would not otherwise have been recognized absent
management's proposal?

3. Is the Board of Directors recommending an action that could cause the
securities held to lose value, rights or privileges and there are no comparable
replacement investments readily available on the market? (For example, a company
can be uniquely positioned in the market because of its valuation compared with
otherwise comparable securities such that it would not be readily replaceable if
we were to liquidate the position. In such a situation, we might vote against
management's recommendation if we believe a "No" vote could help prevent future
share price depreciation resulting from management's proposal or if we believe
the value of the investment will appreciate if management's proposal fails. A
typical recent example of this type of decision is the case of a Board
recommendation not to expense stock options, where we would vote against
management's recommendation because we believe expensing such options will do
more to enhance shareholder value going forward.)

4. Would accepting the Board of Directors recommendation cause us to violate our
client's investment guidelines? (For example, a Board may recommend merging the
company into one that is not permitted by client investment guidelines, e.g. a
tobacco product company, a foreign security that is not traded on any US
exchange or in US dollars, etc., restrictions often found in client investment
guidelines. This would be an unusual situation and it is possible we would,
nevertheless, vote in favor of a Board's recommendation in anticipation of
selling the investment prior to the date any vote would effectively change the
nature of the investment as described. Moreover, this does not mean we will
consider any client-provided proxy voting guidelines. Our policy is that client
investment guidelines may not include proxy voting guidelines if our firm will
vote account proxies. Rather, we will only vote client proxies in accordance
with these guidelines. Clients who wish their account proxies to be voted in
accordance with their own proxy voting guidelines must retain proxy voting
authority for themselves.)

Essentially, we must "second guess" the Board of Directors to determine if their
recommendation is in the best interests of our clients, regardless of whether
the Board thinks their recommendation is in the best interests of shareholders
in general. The above questions should apply no matter the type of action
subject to the proxy. For example, changes in corporate governance structures,
adoption or amendments to compensation plans (including stock options) and
matters involving social issues or corporate responsibility should all be
reviewed in the context of how it will affect our clients' investment.

In making our decisions, to the extent we rely on any analysis outside of the
information contained in the proxy statements, we must retain a record of such
information in the same manner as other books and records (2 years in the
office, 5 years in an easily accessible place). Also, if a proxy statement is
NOT available on the SEC's EDGAR database, we must keep a copy of the proxy
statement.

ADDRESSING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Although it is not likely, in the event there is a conflict of interest between
us and our client in connection with a material proxy vote (for example, (1) the
issuer or an affiliate of the issuer is also a client or is actively being
sought as a client or (2) we have a significant business relationship with the
issuer such that voting in a particular manner could jeopardize this client
and/or business relationship), our policy is to alert affected client(s) of the
conflict before voting and indicate the manner in which we will vote. In such
circumstances, our client(s) may instruct us to vote in a different manner. In
any case, we must obtain client consent to vote the proxy when faced with a
conflict of interest. If the conflict involves a security held by a mutual fund
we manage, then we must present the material conflict to the Board of the
applicable fund for consent or direction to

vote the proxies. If the conflict involves a security held by wrap accounts,
then we may present the conflict to the wrap sponsor, as our agent, to obtain
wrap client consent or direction to vote the proxies. Note that no conflict
generally exists for routine proxy matters such as approval of the independent
auditor (unless, of course, the auditor in question is a client, we are seeking
the auditor as a client or we have a significant business relationship with the
auditor), electing an uncontested Board of Directors, etc.

In the event it is impractical to obtain client consent to vote a proxy when
faced with a conflict of interest, or at the request of the applicable fund
Board, the firm will employ the services of an independent third party "proxy
services firm" to make the proxy voting decision in accordance with Rule
206(4)-6 under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as amended. The firm has
retained the firm of Glass Lewis & Co. to serve in this capacity. All investment
company Boards for which we provide investment management services have
requested we utilize the recommendations of Glass Lewis & Co. in cases of
conflicts of interest.

Once any member of the relevant portfolio management team determines that it
would be in our clients' best interests to vote AGAINST management
recommendations (or, for Madison Scottsdale and Concord Asset Management, any
particular portfolio manager makes such determination), then the decision should
be brought to the attention of the Investment Committee, or any subcommittee
appointed by the Investment Committee from among its members (such subcommittee
may be a single person), to ratify the decision to stray from our general policy
of voting with management. Such ratification need not be in writing.

The Investment Committee or any subcommittee appointed by the Investment
Committee from among its members (such subcommittee may be a single person)
shall monitor potential conflicts of interest between our firm and clients that
would affect the manner by which we vote a proxy. We maintain a "conflicted
list" for proxy voting purposes.

As of January 1, 2004, Jay Sekelsky represents the Investment Committee
subcommittee described above.

ERISA FIDUCIARY ACCOUNTS

As a general rule, an ERISA plan Trustee is required to vote proxies. However,
the fiduciary act of managing plan assets includes the responsibility to vote
proxies on plan-owned stock when the named fiduciary has delegated management
responsibility to an investment manager. Therefore, unless another named
fiduciary (Trustee, another investment manager, consultant, plan administrator,
employer, etc.) for any ERISA client expressly reserves the right to vote
proxies, we are required to do so. In most cases, the plan document will specify
who is required to vote proxies.

It is important that our investment management agreement (or the ERISA client's
plan document) (collectively, the "Contracts") address the issue of who is
responsible for voting proxies.

1. If the Contracts expressly preclude us from voting proxies, then the Trustee
must vote proxies attributable to our ERISA client's accounts.

2. On the other hand, if the Contracts are silent or simply state that we "may"
vote proxies, then it is our fiduciary duty to affirmatively vote under ERISA.

ERISA requires us, when we are responsible for voting proxies:

1. To maintain voting records for review by the named fiduciary of the plan; and

2. Ensure that the custodian (or plan Trustee, as the case may be) forward to us
all proxies received so that we may vote them in a timely manner.

<PAGE>

Our general policy is to vote all ERISA plan proxies received in the same manner
as we vote non-ERISA plan proxies described above. Again, as a matter of
standard operating procedure, all proxies received shall be voted (by telephone
or Internet).

ADDITIONAL RECORDKEEPING RULES RELATED TO PROXY VOTING

We must keep any written documents (including email) we prepared that were
material to making a decision on how to vote a proxy (or that memorialized the
basis for our decision). As noted above, we need not keep a copy of the actual
proxy statements we received if they are available on the SEC's EDGAR database.

We must keep in the applicable client file records of written client requests
for proxy voting information. We must, of course, also keep a copy in the client
file of any of our written responses to clients who asked for such information
either in writing or orally.

We retained the services of ProxyEdge to maintain the records of the proxy votes
we cast on behalf of clients. To the extent we vote any proxies outside of this
service (for example, for logistical purposes, certain Madison Scottsdale
proxies may not be maintained by this service), then copies of the voted proxy
must be maintained in the applicable client or research file, as the case may
be.

Unless an investment company invests exclusively in non-voting securities, it
shall file Form N-PX annually with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
no later than August 31 for the period covering the previous July 1 through June
30.
