CHAIRMAN'S REPORT (UNAUDITED)


   At November 30, 2005 the Company's net asset value was $55.93 per share.  The
closing price of the Company's  stock on the New York Stock  Exchange was $49.65
per share at November 30, 2005,  which  represented a 11.2%  discount to the net
asset  value.  This  compares  with the net asset  value of $49.95  per share at
November  30,  2004 at which time the closing  price was  $44.82,  a discount of
10.3% to the net asset value.

   Net  investment  income for the fiscal year ended  November 30, 2005 was $.10
per share,  as compared to $.22 per share for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2004.  Realized  gains from  investments  net of net realized  loss from foreign
currency transactions for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2005 were $1.25 per
share,  as  compared to $.05 per share for the fiscal  year ended  November  30,
2004.

   Dividends  totaling  $.90 per share were paid or  declared  during the fiscal
year ended  November 30, 2005.  For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2004, the
total dividend  payments were $.55 per share.  (See Note 1.E.  Distributions  to
Shareholders   (page  10)  and  Certain  tax   information   for  United  States
shareholders (pages 13 and 14) for further comments.)

   In July shareholders  approved changes in the Company's  investment  policies
and  restrictions  designed  to provide  the  Company  with  greater  investment
flexibility. Among the changes were the following:

     1. The Company's subclassification under the Investment Company Act of 1940
     was changed from a diversified to a non-diversified company.

     2. The Company is now allowed to increase its investments  outside of South
     Africa.

     3. The  Company is now  allowed to invest  directly  in a broader  array of
     precious minerals and bullion.

     4. The  Company is now  allowed  to invest  its cash in a wider  variety of
     short-term instruments.

   The Company had been  confined to a large  extent to  investment  in precious
mineral (primarily gold) producers in South Africa. Most of our investments were
acquired  many  years  ago at  much  lower  prices  and  there  are  substantial
unrealized capital gains. The tax implications of these unrealized capital gains
will be considered as the new broadened  investment  policies are implemented in
the coming years.

   At our fiscal year end,  the  portfolio  was still about 75%  invested in the
stocks of South African gold and other precious metals mining companies, as well
as  companies  with a  substantial  portion of their  assets  invested  in South
Africa.

THE GOLD BULLION MARKET

   The dollar price of gold enjoyed a  tremendous  surge in calendar  year 2005,
trading  over  $500/oz  in the final  weeks of the year for the first time since
1983. The average for the year will be very close to $445/oz,  almost 10% higher
than the average  achieved in 2004.  Opinion is divided about the reason for the
increase  in the  price of the  metal and in  particular  for the sharp  rise in
recent  weeks.  The more  doom-laden  commentators  suggest  that we are at last
witnessing  a  flight  from  the  fiat  paper  currencies  of  the  world.  More
conventional  explanations that gold is often a refuge in times of inflation are
difficult  to  sustain  in the face of only  limited  signs  of that  particular
economic  disease.  Certainly there is news of considerable  accumulation of the
metal in the new, wealthy communities of China and India.

   Of course,  it is the rand price of gold that the South African mines need to
keep in mind.  At about R 3500 per ounce the gold  price,  while  improving,  is
still below the brief peak value of R 3700 achieved  during the rand collapse in
late 2001. The Johannesburg gold certificate exchange traded fund (New Gold) has
been growing slowly in popularity  since its listing in November 2004.  Turnover
has only very recently exceeded 500,000 units (equivalent to 5,000 oz) per week.
The signs are, however, that interest in gold ETFs in Johannesburg and elsewhere
is picking up quite dramatically as the gold price catches investors' attention.

THE GOLD SHARE MARKET

   The FTSE/JSE  Gold Sector Price Index is currently  around 2350,  its highest
level  since  March  2004,  but quite a way below  the 3500  record  set in 2002
following the collapse of the rand.  Since  January 2005 the  AngloGold  Ashanti
share  price is up almost  45%,  Harmony is up 63% and Gold  Fields is up almost
50%.  These  shares,  however,  sagged in the first  quarter of the year.  Since
reaching their lows in May 2005 the returns have been even greater.  Harmony and
Gold  Fields  have  recovered  from the  ending of a  potentially  very  hostile
corporate  action.  Operationally,  the South African gold producers are putting
strategies in place to cope with the stronger rand environment. Both Harmony and
Gold Fields have announced  projects to expand their offshore  production bases,
which should further reduce country specific risk.

THE GOLD MINING INDUSTRY

   Mine production has been slipping,  primarily as a result of lower production
from South  African  sources and could reach its second lowest level since 1997,
according to Gold Fields  Mineral  Services.  In addition,  producers  have been
de-hedging,  which has removed a source of supply and created additional demand.
Although  official  sector sales have risen,  there has been a sharp fall-off in
scrap  sales.  Investment  demand  tends to track the dollar and this has been a
source of support. Thus, demand rises as the dollar weakens.  Furthermore,  high
oil prices have led to inflation fears,  which has stimulated  investment demand
for gold.  Jewelry  fabrication  demand appears strong although other offtake is
less robust.  On the whole, the supply and demand  fundamentals  appear positive
for gold.

THE PLATINUM INDUSTRY AND MARKET

   The  platinum  price has recently  shot above the  $1,000/oz  mark,  with the
annual  average  price  approaching  $900/oz  after  2004's  $846/oz  and 2003's
$700/oz.  The palladium price has also recently been showing some enthusiasm and
rose above  $250/oz for the first time in more than a year. It will of course be
a long time until this metal again  trades as high as the  heights of  $1,000/oz
experienced briefly in 2001. Both the Anglo Platinum and the Impala share prices
look set to close the year near their  highs.  For Impala this is very near to R
900 per share, about 85% up on the year, while at its November peak of R 485 per
share, Anglo Platinum has more than doubled since the end of last year.

   The platinum  market is expected to remain in  shortfall  according to market
statistics published by Johnson Matthey. Although platinum output should grow 2%
to 6.59 million ounces, output from South Africa is likely to be lower than

2
<PAGE>


previously  expected  as  a  result  of  production  problems.  Johnson  Matthey
forecasts  platinum  demand  of 6.71  million  ounces  for the full  year.  Auto
catalyst  demand  is  expected  to grow  strongly,  by up to 8% to 3.86  million
ounces,  the sixth  successive year of growth in this sector.  Furthermore,  the
growth of diesel catalysis  should lend longer-term  support to platinum demand.
Jewelry demand is, however, expected to fall due to higher prices. Nevertheless,
an overall shortage of the metal should support the platinum price.

THE SOUTH AFRICAN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

   The overarching  economic  variable,  from a South African mineral producer's
perspective,  is the  rand/dollar  exchange rate. 2005 delivered two of the most
unlikely  scenarios.  The rand  continued to be a strong  currency  against most
currencies  --  probably  because  of the  continuing  strength  of  almost  all
commodity  prices  -- and the  dollar  beat the  common  forecasts  and  managed
convincingly  to outperform its rivals in the form of the euro and the yen. Thus
the rand  strengthened  versus  just about every  currency  except the dollar in
2005.  As the end of the year  approaches,  the debate is about whether the rand
could even return to levels  stronger  than 6 per  dollar.  It is  currently  at
around  6.4 per  dollar.  It seems  unwise to make  predictions  about  currency
exchange rates but it seems likely that as long as the prices of all metals both
precious and base continue to boom,  then the rand will remain a strong currency
worldwide. This obviously puts considerable strains on exporting industries like
the mines.

   The South  African  economy  grew in the third  quarter at 4.2%  (quarter  on
quarter   annualized)   down  from  5.4%  in  the   second   quarter.   Repeated
pronouncements  from  government  and the Reserve  Bank  confirm that the target
growth rate is 6% per annum.  This is not an impossible  figure to reach but its
impact on the mining industry may be quite limited.  Major  contributors to such
growth will likely come from long overdue government  spending on infrastructure
as well as continued  consumer  spending,  as the benefits of the Black Economic
Empowerment  ("BEE")  programs and charters  deliver a new aspirant and affluent
middle  class.  The SA  Reserve  Bank  limited  their  intervention  to just one
interest  rate cut of a modest one half  percentage  point  that took  effect in
April 2005.  The precious  metals  mining  industry  will continue to look for a
steady  rise in the price of their  product to allow  them to keep  their  heads
above water.

SOUTH AFRICAN REGULATORY MATTERS

   From a regulatory  perspective,  the feature of the year remained uncertainty
over the  conversion of old order mineral rights to new order rights in terms of
legislation  governing  the  mining  and  minerals  industry.  There  have  been
administrative delays in approving the changeover to new order rights, with only
AngloGold  reporting  this  year that they  have  successfully  converted  their
rights. A portion of Harmony's rights were converted in 2004, while Gold Fields,
Impala and Anglo Platinum have lodged their requests for rights conversion.  The
platinum  producers are continuing to expand,  both in South Africa and Zimbabwe
despite the  uncertainties  relating  to the rights  conversion.  BEE,  which is
required in terms of compliance with the minerals legislation, is continuing. In
December,  Anglo  Platinum  announced a BEE  transaction  while Impala  issued a
cautionary  relating to an  undisclosed  BEE deal.  This suggests that the South
African  precious metal producers are undertaking  steps to mitigate  regulatory
risk.

PORTFOLIO CHANGES

   During  the year we added  to our  holdings  outside  of  South  Africa  with
purchases of Meridian Gold Inc., Goldcorp Inc. and Lonmin PLC.

   Meridian Gold, headquartered in Reno, Nevada, holds 100% interest in El Penon
Mine in  Northern  Chile.  It also owns 100%  interest  Esquel  Gold  Deposit in
Argentina  and an interest in the Rossi  Project in the Carlin  Trend in Nevada.
The company is believed to have proven and  probable  reserves of  approximately
4.4 million ounces. It produced 315,000 ounces of gold in 2004.

   Goldcorp is a Canadian based gold producer.  Its assets include a mine in the
Red Lake District of Ontario and other interests in Argentina, Mexico, Australia
and the U.S.  The company  also owns a 65%  interest in Silver  Wheaton  Corp, a
publicly  traded company  engaged in the purchase and sale of silver from Mexico
and Sweden.  Goldcorp produced  approximately 628,000 ounces of gold in 2004 and
reports reserves of 5.22 million ounces of gold.

   Lonmin is the third  largest  primary  producer of platinum in the world.  It
produces over 900,000 ounces of platinum  annually as well as the other platinum
group metals such as palladium and rhodium.  Its  operations  are located in the
northwest province of South Africa.

   During the year we reduced our holdings of Gold Fields, AngloGold, Impala and
Anglo Platinum.

   Consolidation  within the gold mining  industry  continues.  Barrick Gold has
offered $10.4  billion in cash and stock for Placer Dome.  Following the planned
sale of certain  assets to Goldcorp,  Barrick  Gold will be the world's  largest
gold producer with its annual production of 8.3 million ounces, exceeding number
two, Newmont Mining,  with its 6.26 million ounces. The offer expires on January
16,  2006.  If  Barrick  succeeds,  Goldcorp  intends to pay  Barrick  for their
Canadian  operations  and a 40%  interest  in  Pueblo  Viejo,  in the  Dominican
Republic. Goldcorp with its new assets will become the 9th largest producer with
production at a rate of 2 million ounces per annum. It is difficult to speculate
on what may then happen to Placer  Dome's 50% interest in the South Deep mine in
South Africa.

   On December 22, 2005 Placer  Dome's  board  announced  that they  unanimously
backed the Barrick offer.

CERTAIN INVESTMENT POLICIES AND RESTRICTIONS (UNAUDITED)

The following is a summary of certain of the Company's  investment  policies and
restrictions  and is  subject  to the  more  complete  statements  contained  in
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

THE  CONCENTRATION  OF  INVESTMENTS  IN  A  PARTICULAR   INDUSTRY  OR  GROUP  OF
INDUSTRIES.  It is a fundamental policy (i.e., a policy that may be changed only
by shareholder vote) of the Company that at least 80% of its total assets be (i)
invested  in common  shares or  securities  convertible  into  common  shares of
companies  engaged,  directly  or  indirectly,  in the  exploration,  mining  or
processing of gold, silver, platinum,  diamonds or other precious minerals, (ii)
held as  bullion  or  other  direct  forms of gold,  silver,  platinum  or other
precious minerals, (iii) invested in instruments representing interests in gold,
silver,  platinum or other  precious  minerals such as  certificates  of deposit
therefor, and/or (iv) invested in securities of investment companies,  including
exchange  traded  funds,  or other  securities  that seek to replicate the price
movement of gold,  silver or platinum  bullion.  Compliance  with the percentage
limitation  relating to the  concentration of the Company's  investments will be
measured at the time of investment.

If  investment  opportunities  deemed by the  Company to be  attractive  are not
available in the types of securities referred to in the preceding paragraph, the
Company  may  deviate  from the  investment  policy  outlined  in the  preceding
paragraph  and make  temporary  investments  of unlimited  amounts in securities
issued by the U.S.  Government,  its agencies or instrumentalities or other high
quality money market instruments.

THE  PERCENTAGE  OF VOTING  SECURITIES  OF ANY ONE ISSUER  THAT THE  COMPANY MAY
ACQUIRE. It is the non-fundamental policy (i.e., a policy that may be changed by
the Board of  Directors)  of the Company  that the Company  shall not purchase a
security  if, at the time of  purchase,  more than 20% of the value of its total
assets would be invested in securities of the issuer of such security.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the  Board  of Directors and Shareholders of ASA (Bermuda) Limited:

   We have audited the  accompanying  statement of assets and liabilities of ASA
(Bermuda) Limited (the "Company"),  including the schedule of investments, as of
November 30, 2005,  and the related  statement of operations  and  supplementary
information for the year then ended,  the statement of changes in net assets for
each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for
each of the four years in the period then  ended.  These  financial  statements,
supplementary information and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Company's  management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an opinion on these
financial statements,  supplementary  information and financial highlights based
on our audits.  The financial  highlights  for the year ended  November 30, 2001
were audited by other auditors whose report dated December 18, 2001 expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial highlights.

   We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with the  standards  of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements,  supplementary  information and financial  highlights are
free of  material  misstatement.  We were not engaged to perform an audit of the
Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our  audits  included
consideration  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as a basis for
designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but not
for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Company's
internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial   statements,   supplementary
information and financial  highlights,  assesing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made  by  management  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
securities owned as of November 30, 2005 by  correspondence  with the custodian.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion,  the  financial  statements,  supplementary  information  and
financial highlights referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the  financial  position of ASA  (Bermuda)  Limited at November  30,  2005,  the
results of its operations and supplementary information for the year then ended,
the  changes  in its net  assets  for each of the two years in the  period  then
ended,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the four years in the period
then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Year ended November 30, 2005

1.  SUMMARY  OF  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  ASA  (Bermuda)  Limited is a
closed-end  management  investment  company  registered  under the United States
Investment  Company  Act of  1940,  and was  organized  as an  exempted  limited
liability company under the laws of Bermuda.

A. INVESTMENTS

Portfolio  securities  listed on U.S. and foreign stock  exchanges are generally
valued at the last  reported  sales price on the last trading day of the period,
or the mean  between the closing bid and asked  prices of those  securities  not
traded on that date.  In the event that a mean price  cannot be computed  due to
the absence of either a bid or an asked price, then the bid price plus 1% or the
asked price less 1%, as applicable,  is used. Securities listed on foreign stock
exchanges  may be fair valued  based on  significant  events that have  occurred
subsequent to the close of the foreign markets.

Securities  for which current market  quotations  are not readily  available are
valued at their fair value as determined in good faith by, or in accordance with
procedures adopted by, the Company's Board of Directors. If a security is valued
at a "fair  value",  that value is likely to be  different  from the last quoted
price for the security.  Various factors may be reveiwed in order to make a good
faith  determination of a security's fair value. These factors include,  but are
not  limited  to, the nature of the  security;  relevant  financial  or business
developments  of the  issuer;  actively  traded  similar or related  securities;
conversion rights on the security; and changes in overall market conditions.

Where the Company holds  securities  listed on foreign stock  exchanges and ADRs
representing  these  securities  are  actively  traded  on the  New  York  Stock
Exchange,  the securities are fair valued based on the last reported sales price
of the ADRs.

The  difference  between cost and current  value is reflected  separately as net
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments.  The net realized gain or
loss from the sale of securities is determined  for  accounting  purposes on the
identified cost basis.

There is no assurance that the valuation at which the Company's  investments are
carried could be realized upon sale.

B. CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company  considers  all money market and all highly  liquid  temporary  cash
investments  purchased with an original maturity of less than three months to be
cash equivalents.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio  securities  and other assets and  liabilities  denominated in foreign
currencies  are  translated  into U.S.  dollar  amounts at the  closing  rate of
exchange on the date of valuation.  Purchases and sales of investment securities
and income and expense items  denominated  in foreign  currencies are translated
into U.S.  dollar  amounts on the  respective  dates of such  transactions.  The
resulting  net foreign  currency  gain or loss is included in the  statement  of
operations.

D. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

During the year  ended  November  30,  2005,  sales of  securities  amounted  to
$39,471,259 and purchases of securities amounted to $32,348,576.

Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend  date, net of withholding  taxes,
if any. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

E. DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dividends to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.

The reporting for financial  statement purposes of distributions made during the
fiscal year from net  investment  income or net  realized  gains may differ from
their  ultimate  reporting for United States  federal  income tax purposes.  The
differences  are  caused  primarily  by the  separate  line item  reporting  for
financial  statement  purposes of foreign exchange gains or losses. See pages 13
and 14 for additional tax information for United States shareholders.

F. USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the  financial
statements  and  accompanying  notes.  Actual  results  could  differ from those
estimates.

G. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statements are presented in United States dollars.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Year ended November 30, 2005

2.   RETIREMENT   PLANS  In  1994,  the  Company  entered  into  a  supplemental
non-qualified  pension  agreement  with its  Chairman.  Under  the  terms of the
agreement,  the  Company  agreed  to  credit  $25,000  per year for five  years,
beginning  December 1, 1993,  to a  Supplemental  Pension  Account with interest
credited at an annual rate of 3.5%.

   The Board of Directors  approved increases in the amount of the annual credit
as  follows:  $28,125 in May 1999;  $31,250 in February  2002;  $45,000 in March
2003,  $55,000 in  February  2004 and $60,000 in March  2005.  As a result,  the
Company has recorded an expense of $58,333 for the year ended November 30, 2005.

   The  Company has  recorded an asset in the amount of $170,000  related to the
retirement  obligation  liability  of  $463,967  as of November  30,  2005.  The
$463,967  represents the total liability payable under the agreement at November
30, 2005. Upon retirement from the Company, the liability under the agreement is
payable in ten consecutive equal annual payments to the Chairman.

   The  Company  recorded a provision  of $739,431  during the fiscal year ended
November  30,  2005  for  an  actuarially   determined  unfunded  liability  for
retirement  benefits due to current and future retired  directors.  Directors of
the  Company  qualify to receive  retirement  benefits  if they have  served the
Company  (and its  predecessor,  ASA Limited) for at least twelve years prior to
retirement.

3. ASA LIMITED In connection  with the winding up of the Company's  predecessor,
ASA Limited,  in South Africa, the Company incurred expenses of $225,790 for the
fiscal year ended November 30, 2005.

4.  CONCENTRATION  RISK It is a fundamental  policy of the Company that at least
80% of its total assets be invested in securities of companies engaged, directly
or  indirectly,  in the  exploration,  mining  or  processing  of gold or  other
precious  minerals  and/or  in other  gold  and  precious  mineral  investments.
A substantial  portion of the  Company's  assets  currently is invested in South
African companies and other companies having significant assets or operations in
South Africa.  The Company is, therefore,  subject to gold and precious  mineral
related  risks as well as risks  related to investing in South Africa  including
political,  economic,  regulatory,  currency  fluctuation  and foreign  exchange
risks. As a result of industry consolidation,  the Company currently is invested
in a limited  number of  securities  and thus holds large  positions  in certain
securities.  Because the Company's  investments  are  concentrated  in a limited
number of  securities  of  companies  involved  in the  mining of gold and other
precious minerals and related activities, the net asset value of the Company may
be  subject  to  greater  volatility  than  that of a more  broadly  diversified
investment company.

5. INDEMNIFICATIONS In  the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into
contracts  that contain a variety of  indemnifications.  The  Company's  maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown.  However,  the Company has not had
prior claims or losses pursuant to these indemnification  provisions and expects
the risk of loss thereunder to be remote.

CERTAIN TAX INFORMATION FOR
UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS (UNAUDITED)

From  December 1, 1963 through  November 30, 1987,  the Company was treated as a
"foreign  investment  company"  for United  States  federal  income tax purposes
pursuant to Section 1246 of the Internal  Revenue Code.  Under that  section,  a
United States  shareholder  who has held his shares in the Company for more than
one year is subject to tax at  ordinary  income tax rates on his profit (if any)
on a sale of his shares to the extent of his  "ratable  share" of the  Company's
earnings  and  profits  accumulated  for the period  during  which he held those
shares  between  December 1, 1963 and November 30, 1987.  If such  shareholder's
profit on the sale of his  shares  exceeds  such  ratable  share and he held his
shares for more than one year,  then,  subject to the discussion below regarding
the United States  federal  income tax rules  applicable to taxable years of the
Company  beginning  after  November 30, 1987,  he is subject to tax at long-term
capital gain rates on the excess.

   The Company's per share earnings and profits  accumulated  (undistributed) in
each of the taxable years from 1964 through 1987 is available  upon request from
LGN Group, LLC, P.O. Box 269, Florham Park, NJ 07932.

   Under  rules  enacted  by the Tax Reform Act of 1986,  the  Company  became a
"passive foreign investment  company" (a "PFIC") on December 1, 1987. The manner
in which these rules apply  depends on whether a United States  shareholder  (1)
elects to treat the Company as a qualified electing fund ("QEF") with respect to
his  Company  shares,  (2) for  taxable  years  of a United  States  shareholder
beginning after December 31, 1997, elects to "mark-to-market" his Company shares
as of the close of each taxable year, or (3) makes neither election.

   In general,  if a United  States  shareholder  of the  Company  does NOT make
either such election, any gain realized on the disposition of his Company shares
will be treated as ordinary  income.  In addition,  such a  shareholder  will be
subject to an  "interest  charge" on part of his tax  liability  with respect to
such  gain,  as well as with  respect to an  "excess  distribution"  made by the
Company (as explained in the following paragraph).  Furthermore,  shares held by
such a  shareholder  may be  denied  the  benefit  of any  otherwise  applicable
increase in tax basis at death.  Under  proposed  regulations,  a  "disposition"
would include a U.S. taxpayer's becoming a nonresident alien.

   As noted, the general tax consequences  described in the preceding  paragraph
apply to an  "excess  distribution"  on  Company  shares,  which is  defined  as
distributions  by the Company a shareholder  receives during a taxable year that
are more than 125% of the average amount it distributed  for the three preceding
taxable years.* If the Company makes an excess  distribution in a year, a United
States  shareholder who has not made a QEF or  mark-to-market  election would be
required to allocate the excess amount  ratably over the ENTIRE  holding  period
for his shares. That allocation would result in tax being payable at the highest
applicable  rate in the  prior  taxable  years  to  which  the  distribution  is
allocated and interest charges being imposed on the resulting  "underpayment" of
taxes made in those years.  In contrast,  a  distribution  that is not an excess
distribution  would  be  taxable  to a  United  States  shareholder  as a normal
dividend,** with no interest charge.

   If a United  States  shareholder  elects to treat the  Company  as a QEF with
respect to his shares  therein  for his first  taxable  year he holds his shares
during  which the  Company is a PFIC (or later makes the QEF  election  and also
elects to treat his shares  generally as if they were sold for their fair market
value on the first day of the first  taxable  year of the  Company for which the
QEF election is effective, in which event the gain from such "deemed sale" would
be treated as an excess  distribution),  the rules  described  in the  preceding
paragraphs  generally  would not apply.  Instead,  the  electing  United  States
shareholder would include annually in his gross income his PRO RATA share of the
Company's   ordinary  earnings  and  net  capital  gain  (his  "QEF"  inclusion)
regardless  of whether  such income or gain was actually  distributed.  A United
States shareholder who makes a valid QEF election will recognize capital gain on
any profit  from the  actual  sale of his  shares if those  shares  were held as
capital assets,  except to the extent of the shareholder's  ratable share of the
earnings and profits of the Company  accumulated  for the period during which he
held those shares  between  December 1, 1963 and November 30, 1987, as described
above.

   Alternatively,  if a  United  States  shareholder  makes  the  mark-to-market
election with respect to Company shares for taxable years  beginning on or after
January 1, 1998,  such  shareholder  would be  required  annually  to report any
unrealized  gain  with  respect  to his  shares  as  ordinary  income,  and  any
unrealized  loss would be permitted as an ordinary  loss, but only to the extent
of previous inclusions of ordinary income. Any gain subsequently  realized by an
electing United States shareholder on a sale or other disposition of his Company
shares also would be treated as ordinary income,  but such shareholder would not
be subject to an interest  charge on his resulting tax liability.  Special rules
apply to a United States shareholder that held his PFIC stock prior to his first
taxable year for which the mark-to-market election was effective.

   A United States  shareholder with a valid QEF election in effect would not be
taxed  on any  distributions  paid  by the  Company  to the  extent  of any  QEF
inclusions,  but any  distributions  out of accumulated  earnings and profits in
excess thereof would be treated as taxable  dividends.  Such a shareholder would
increase the tax basis in his Company shares by the amount of any QEF inclusions
and reduce such tax basis

- -----------------------
* For example,  the Company made annual distributions of $.55, $.80 and $.80 per
share during 2004, 2003 and 2002,  respectively,  an average per year of $.71667
per share.  Accordingly,  any  distribution in excess of $.90 per share (125% of
$.71667) would be treated as an excess  distribution  for 2005.  (All amounts in
U.S.  currency.)

** Because the Company is a PFIC, dividends it pays will not qualify for the 15%
maximum U.S. federal income tax rate on dividends that individuals receive.
                                                                              13
<PAGE>

by any  distributions  to him that are not taxable as described in the preceding
sentence.  Special  rules apply to United States  shareholders  who make the QEF
election and wish to defer the payment of tax on their annual QEF inclusions.

   Each  shareholder  who desires QEF  treatment  must  individually  elect such
treatment. The QEF election must be made for the taxable year of the shareholder
in which or with which the taxable  year of the Company  ends. A QEF election is
effective  for the  shareholder's  taxable  year  for  which  it is made and all
subsequent  taxable years of the  shareholder and may not be revoked without the
consent of the Internal Revenue Service.  A shareholder of the Company who first
held his Company  shares after November 30, 2004 and who files his tax return on
the basis of a calendar  year may make a QEF election on his 2005 tax return.  A
shareholder  of the  Company  who  first  held his  Company  shares on or before
November  30,  2004 may also make the QEF  election  on his 2005 tax  return but
should consult his tax advisor concerning the tax consequences and special rules
that apply when a QEF election  could have been made with respect to such shares
for an earlier taxable year.

   The QEF  election  must be made by the  due  date,  with  extensions,  of the
federal  income tax return for the  taxable  year for which the  election  is to
apply. Under Treasury regulations,  the QEF election is made on Internal Revenue
Service Form 8621, which must be completed and attached to a timely filed income
tax return in which the  shareholder  reports his QEF  inclusion for the taxable
year to which the election applies. In order to allow United States shareholders
to make the QEF elections  and to comply with the  applicable  annual  reporting
requirements,  the  Company  annually  will  provide  to  them  a  "PFIC  Annual
Information  Statement"  containing  certain  information  required  by Treasury
regulations.

   In early 2006, the Company will send to United States  shareholders  the PFIC
Annual  Information  Statement for the Company's 2005 taxable year.  Such annual
information  statement  may be used for  purposes  of  completing  Form 8621.  A
shareholder  who either is subject  to a prior QEF  election  or is making a QEF
election for the first time must attach a completed  Form 8621 to his income tax
return each year.  Other United States  shareholders  also must attach completed
Forms 8621 to their tax returns  each year,  but  shareholders  not electing QEF
treatment will not need to report QEF inclusions thereon.

   Special rules apply to United States  persons who hold Company shares through
intermediate  entities or persons and to United States shareholders who directly
or indirectly pledge their shares, including those in a margin account.

   Ordinarily, the tax basis that is obtained by a transferee of property on the
death of the owner of that  property is adjusted to the  property's  fair market
value on the date of death (or  alternate  valuation  date).  If a United States
shareholder  dies  owning  shares  with  respect  to which he did not  elect QEF
treatment  (or elected such  treatment  after the first taxable year in which he
owned shares in which the Company was a PFIC and did not elect to recognize gain
as  described  above),  the  transferee  of those shares will not be entitled to
adjust  the tax  basis in such  shares to the fair  market  value on the date of
death (or alternate valuation date). In that case, in general, the transferee of
such shares  will take a basis in the shares  equal to the  shareholder's  basis
therein immediately before his death. If a United States shareholder dies owning
Company  shares for which a valid QEF  election  was in effect  for all  taxable
years in such  shareholder's  holding period during which the Company was a PFIC
(or the  shareholder  made a "deemed sale"  election),  then the basis  increase
generally will be available unless the holding period for his shares began on or
prior to November  30,  1987.  In the latter  case,  in general,  any  otherwise
applicable  basis  increase  will be reduced to the extent of the  shareholder's
ratable  share of the  earnings and profits of the Company  accumulated  for the
period during which he held those shares  between  December 1, 1963 and November
30, 1987.

   DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE APPLICABLE TAX RULES, UNITED STATES SHAREHOLDERS
OF THE COMPANY ARE STRONGLY  URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS  CONCERNING
THE  IMPACT  OF THESE  RULES ON THEIR  INVESTMENT  IN THE  COMPANY  AND ON THEIR
INDIVIDUAL SITUATIONS.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (UNAUDITED)



   Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare") has been engaged to offer
a dividend  reinvestment  and stock purchase plan (the "Plan") to  shareholders.
Shareholders  may elect to participate in the Plan by signing an  authorization.
The  authorization  appoints  Computershare as agent to apply to the purchase of
common  shares of the Company in the open market (i) all cash  dividends  (after
deduction of the service  charge  described  below) that become  payable to such
participant on the Company's shares (including shares registered in his name and
shares  accumulated  under the Plan) and (ii) any optional cash investments ($50
minimum,   subject  to  an  annual  maximum  of  $60,000)   received  from  such
participant.

   For the  purpose  of making  purchases,  Computershare  will  commingle  each
participant's  funds with those of all other participants in the Plan. The price
per  share of  shares  purchased  for each  participant's  account  shall be the
average price (including brokerage  commissions and any other costs of purchase)
of all shares  purchased in the open market with the net funds  available from a
cash dividend and any voluntary cash payments being concurrently  invested.  Any
stock  dividends or split shares  distributed on shares held in the Plan will be
credited to the participant's account.

   For each  participant,  a service charge of 5% of the combined  amount of the
participant's dividend and any voluntary payment being concurrently invested, up
to a maximum  charge  of $2.50 per  participant  plus  $.03 per  share,  will be
deducted  (and  paid  to  Computershare)  prior  to  each  purchase  of  shares.
Shareholder  sales of shares held by  Computershare in the Plan are subject to a
fee of $10.00  plus  $.12 per  share  deducted  from the  proceeds  of the sale.
Additional  nominal fees are charged by Computershare  for specific  shareholder
requests such as requests for  information  regarding share cost basis detail in
excess of two prior years and for replacement Forms 1099 older than three years.

   Participation  in the Plan may be terminated by a participant  at any time by
written  instructions to  Computershare.  Upon  termination,  a participant will
receive a  certificate  for the full number of shares  credited to his  account,
unless he requests the sale of all or part of such shares.

   Dividends  reinvested  by a  shareholder  under  the Plan will  generally  be
treated for U.S.  federal  income tax  purposes in the same manner as  dividends
paid to such shareholder in cash. See "Certain tax information for United States
shareholders" for more information  regarding tax consequences to U.S. investors
of an investment in shares of the Company, including the effect of the Company's
status as a PFIC.  The  amount of the  service  charge  is  deductible  for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, subject to limitations.

   To  participate  in the Plan an investor may not hold his shares in a "street
name" brokerage account.

   Additional information regarding the Plan may be obtained from Computershare,
P.O. Box 43081, Providence,  RI 02940-3081.  Information may also be obtained on
the internet at  www.computershare.com/equiserve  or by calling  Computershare's
Telephone  Response  Center at  1-781-575-2723  between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.,

                Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

                              ASA (BERMUDA) LIMITED

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

        The following is a statement of the proxy voting policies and procedures
of ASA (Bermuda) Limited ("Company").

        PROXY ADMINISTRATION

        The Company understands its proxy voting responsibilities and that proxy
voting decisions may affect the long-term interests of its shareholders. The
Company attempts to process every proxy vote it receives. However, voting
proxies for shares of certain non-U.S. companies may involve significantly
greater effort and cost than for shares of U.S. companies. There may be
situations where the Company may not or cannot vote a proxy. For example, the
Company may receive proxy material too late to act upon or the cost of voting
may outweigh the benefit of voting.

        Authority and responsibility to vote proxies with respect to the
Company's portfolio securities has been delegated to the President and, in his
absence or inability to act, the Secretary. In evaluating proxy proposals, the
President (or Secretary, when appropriate) may consider information from various
sources, including management of the company presenting a proposal as well as
independent sources. The ultimate decision rests with the President (or
Secretary, when appropriate), who is accountable to the Board of Directors of
the Company.

        GENERAL PRINCIPLES

        In voting proxies, the Company will act solely in the best economic
interests of its shareholders with the goal of maximizing the value of the
Company's portfolio. These policies and procedures are designed to promote
accountability of a portfolio company's

<PAGE>


management and board of directors to its shareholders and to align their
interests with those of shareholders. These policies and procedures recognize
that a portfolio company's managers are entrusted with the day-to-day operations
of the company, as well as longer-term strategic planning, subject to the
company's board of directors.

        The Company believes that the quality and depth of a portfolio company's
management, including its board of directors, is an important consideration in
determining the desirability of an investment. Accordingly, the recommendations
of management on many issues are given substantial weight in determining how to
vote a proxy. However, each issue is considered on its own merits, and the
position of the portfolio company's management will not be supported whenever it
is determined not to be in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders.

        SPECIFIC POLICIES

        A.      ROUTINE MATTERS

                1.      ELECTION OF DIRECTORS. In general, the Company will vote
                        in favor of management's director nominees if they are
                        running unopposed. The Company believes that management
                        is in the best position to evaluate the qualifications
                        of directors and the needs of a particular board.
                        Nevertheless, the Company will vote against, or withhold
                        its vote for, any nominee whom it feels is not
                        qualified. When management's nominees are opposed in a
                        proxy contest, the Company will evaluate which nominee's
                        publicly-announced management policies and goals are
                        most likely to maximize shareholder value, as well as
                        the past performance of the incumbent.

                2.      RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF AUDITORS. In general, the
                        Company will rely on the judgment of management in
                        selecting the independent auditors, Nevertheless, the
                        Company will examine the recommendation of management in
                        appropriate cases, e.g., where there has been a change
                        in auditors based upon a disagreement on accounting
                        matters.

                3.      STOCK OPTION AND OTHER EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION PLAN
                        PROPOSALS. The Company will generally approve
                        management's recommendations with respect to the
                        adoption or amendment of stock option plans and other
                        equity based compensation plans, provided that the total
                        number of shares reserved under all of a company's plans
                        is reasonable and not excessively dilutive.

<PAGE>


        B.      ACQUISITIONS, MERGERS, REINCORPORATIONS, REORGANIZATIONS AND
                OTHER TRANSACTIONS

                Because voting on transactions such as acquisitions, mergers,
                reincorporations and reorganizations involve considerations
                unique to each transaction, the Company does not have a general
                policy in regard to voting on those transactions. The Company
                will vote on a case-by-case basis on each transaction.

        C.      CHANGES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURE

                The Company evaluates proposed capital actions on a case-by-case
                basis and will generally defer to management's business analysis
                in support of such actions. In cases where proposed capital
                actions support proxy defenses or act to reduce or limit
                shareholder rights, particular consideration will be given to
                all the effects of the action and the Company's vote will be
                made in a manner consistent with the objective of maximizing
                long-term shareholder value.

        D.      ANTI-TAKEOVER PROPOSALS

                In general, the Company will vote against any proposal which the
                Company believes would materially contribute to preventing a
                potential acquisition or takeover, including proposals to:

                        o  Stagger the board of directors;

                        o  Introduce cumulative voting;

                        o  Introduce unequal voting rights;

                        o  Create supermajority voting;

                        o  Establish preemptive rights.

                In general, the Company will vote in favor of any proposals to
                reverse the above.

        E.      SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS INVOLVING SOCIAL, MORAL OR ETHICAL MATTERS

                In general, the Company will vote in accordance with
                management's recommendation on issues that primarily involve
                social, moral or ethical matters, although exceptions may be
                made in certain instances where the Company believes a proposal
                has substantial economic implications.

        F.      CONFLICT OF INTEREST

                In view of the fact that the Company is internally managed and
                does not have an investment advisor, it is unlikely that
                conflicts of interest will

<PAGE>


                arise in voting the proxies of the Company's portfolio
                companies. The Company maintains a record of the affiliated
                persons of each director and officer of the Company including
                the President and Secretary. The Compliance Officer reviews
                proxy statement proposals to determine the existence of a
                potential conflict of interest. In the event that the President
                (or Secretary, when appropriate) has a personal conflict of
                interest, he shall remove himself from the voting process. In
                cases of a conflict of interest, a record shall be maintained
                confirming that the Company's vote was made solely in the
                interests of the Company and without regard to any other
                consideration.

                There have been no material changes to the procedures by which

Item 11.        Controls and Procedures

                        his capacities as principal executive officer and
                        principal financial officer of the registrant, has
                        concluded that the registrant's disclosure controls and
                        procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the
                        Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act")) are
                        effective, based on his evaluation of these controls and
                        procedures as of a date within 90 days prior to the
                        filing date of this report.

                (b)     There were no changes in the registrant's internal
                        control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
                        30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act) that occurred during the
                        second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
                        report that have materially affected, or are

<PAGE>


                        reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
                        internal control over financial reporting.

Item 12.        Exhibits.

                (a)(1)  The code of ethics that is the subject of disclosure
                        under Item 2 above is attached hereto.

                   (2)  The certification required by Rule 30a-2(a) under the
                        1940 Act is attached hereto.

                   (3)  Not applicable.

                (b)     The certification required by Rule 30a-2(b) under the
                        1940 Act, Rule 13a-14(b) under the Exchange Act and
                        Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title 18 of the United
                        States Code is attached hereto. This certification is
                        not deemed "filed" for purposes of Section 18 of the
                        Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liability of
                        that section. Such certification will not be deemed to
                        be incorporated by reference into any filing under the
                        Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except to
                        the extent that the registrant specifically incorporates

                              ASA (BERMUDA) LIMITED

          CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL OFFICERS


I.      PURPOSE OF CODE OF ETHICS

        The Board of Directors of ASA (Bermuda) Limited ("Company") has adopted
this Code of Ethics ("Code") to promote the honest and ethical conduct of the
Covered Officers (as described below), including the ethical handling of actual
or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
relationships; to promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
disclosure in reports and documents the Company files with, or submits to, the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
communications made by the Company; and to promote compliance with applicable
laws and governmental rules and regulations. This Code was adopted for purposes
of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable rules and forms
thereunder. Covered Officers, as well as others, are subject to other policies
and procedures in respect of their positions with the Company.


II.     INTRODUCTION

        The Code of Ethics is applicable to the Company's principal executive
officer and principal financial officer ("Covered Officers," each of whom is
identified on Exhibit A).

        Each Covered Officer is expected to act with integrity and honesty,
adhere to a high standard of business ethics and be sensitive to situations that
may give rise to actual as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

        Waivers of this Code may be made only by the Board of Directors or the
Ethics Committee of the Board and will be disclosed in accordance with
applicable law.



III.    CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

        A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes with the interest of, or his service to, the Company. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Person used, or
attempted to use, his position with the Company to obtain any improper personal
benefit for himself, his family members, or any other person.
<PAGE>


        Certain conflicts of interest that may arise are already subject to
conflict of interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940
Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain
transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with
the Company because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Company. The
Company's compliance programs and procedures are designed to address those
conflicts of interest and such conflicts are not covered by this Code.

        Although it is not possible to list and address every conceivable
conflict, the following are examples of actions that Covered Officers must take
to avoid conflict of interest situations. Each Covered Officer must not:

        o       use his personal influence or relationships improperly to
                influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the
                Company for the purpose of benefiting personally to the
                detriment of the Company;

        o       cause the Company to take actions, or fail to take action, for
                the personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
                benefit of the Company;

        o       without the approval of the President (or, with respect to the
                President, approval of the Ethics Committee), accept employment
                with or serve as a director of another investment company, an
                investment adviser or any public company;

        o       accept any business related gift in excess of $100;

        o       accept any entertainment from any company with which the Company
                has current or prospective business dealings unless such
                entertainment is business related, reasonable in cost,
                appropriate as to time and place, and not so frequent as to
                raise any reasonable question of impropriety;

        o       without the approval of the President (or, with respect to the
                President, approval of the Ethics Committee), have or acquire
                any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
                relationship with, any of the Company's service providers; and

        o       have a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions,
                transaction charges or spreads paid by the Company for effecting
                portfolio transactions.

<PAGE>


IV.     COMPLIANCE AND DISCLOSURE

        Each Covered Officer:

        o       is responsible for adhering to and promoting compliance with the
                standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
                regulations;

        o       is responsible for maintaining familiarity with the disclosure
                requirements applicable to the Company;

        o       shall not knowingly misrepresent, omit, or cause others to
                misrepresent or omit, material facts about the Company to
                others, whether within or outside of the Company, including the
                Company's directors and independent auditors and governmental
                regulators;

        o       shall, to the extent appropriate within his area of
                responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
                Company and its service providers with the goal of promoting
                full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
                the reports and documents the Company files with, or submits to,
                the SEC and in other public communications made by the Company;

        o       shall not coerce, manipulate, mislead or fraudulently influence
                any auditor engaged in the performance of an audit of the
                Company's financial statements or accounting books and records;

        o       shall not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any
                other officer or employee of the Company for reports of
                potential violations that are made in good faith.

        o       shall promptly bring to the attention of the President, the
                Ethics Committee and the Audit Committee any information he may
                have concerning (a) significant deficiencies and material
                weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
                financial reporting which are likely to adversely affect the
                Company's ability to record, process, summarize, and report
                financial information, and (b) any fraud, whether or not
                material, that involves management or other employees who have a
                significant role in the Company's internal control over
                financial reporting; and

        o       shall promptly bring to the attention of the Chief Legal
                Officer, the President and the Ethics Committee any information
                he may have concerning evidence of a material violation of the
                securities laws or other

<PAGE>


                laws, rules or regulations applicable to the Company or of a
                violation of this Code.


V.      ACCOUNTABILITY

        The Ethics Committee shall have the power to monitor, investigate and
recommend action to the Board with respect to violations of this Code. The
Board, with the advice of the Ethics Committee, shall determine appropriate
actions to be taken in the event of violations of this Code by the Covered
Officers. Such actions shall be reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to
promote accountability for adherence to this Code. In determining what action is
appropriate in a particular case, the Board shall take into account all relevant
information, including the nature and severity of the violation, whether the
violation was a single occurrence or involved repeated occurrences, whether the
violation appears to have been intentional or inadvertent, whether the
individual in question had been advised prior to the violation as to the
appropriate course of action and whether or not the individual in question had
committed other violations in the past.


VI.     ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COVERED OFFICER

        Upon becoming subject to this Code, each Covered Officer must affirm in
writing to the Board that he has received, read and understands the Code.
Thereafter, each Covered Officer must affirm annually to the Board that he has
complied with the requirements of the Code.


VII.    CONFIDENTIALITY OF REPORTS AND RECORDS

        All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
will be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected
accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters
shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the Board, the Ethics Committee, the
Audit Committee and, as appropriate, their advisers.

VIII.

        Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by the Board of Directors, including a majority of its
independent directors.

I, Robert J.A. Irwin, certify that:

     1.   I have reviewed this report on Form N-CSR of ASA (Bermuda) Limited;

     2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue
          statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
          necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
          under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
          the period covered by the report;

     3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
          information included in this report, fairly present in all material
          respects the financial condition, results of operations, changes in
          net assets, and cash flows (if the financial statements are required
          to include a statement of cash flows) of the registrant as of, and
          for, the periods presented in the report;

     4.   I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
          and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment
          Company Act of 1940) and internal control over financial reporting (as
          defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of 1940) for
          the registrant and have:

          a.   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
               disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my
               supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
               known to me by others within those entities, particularly during
               the period in which this report is being prepared;

          b.   Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or
               caused such internal control over financial reporting to be
               designed under my supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
               regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
               preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
               accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

          c.   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
               controls and procedures and presented in this report my
               conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
               and procedures, as of a date within 90 days prior to the filing
               date of this report based on such evaluation; and

          d.   Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal
               control over financial reporting that occurred during the second
               fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
               materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
               affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
               reporting; and

     5.   I have disclosed to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
          of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
          equivalent functions):

          a.   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
               which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial
               information; and

          b.   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
               internal control over financial reporting.
