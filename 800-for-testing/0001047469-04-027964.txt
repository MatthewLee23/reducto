 LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

                                                                 August 17, 2004

DEAR SHAREHOLDER:

For the six month period ended June 30, 2004, The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
had a decrease in its net asset value of 4.42%, vs. a decline of 3.50% for the
Morgan Stanley Capital International Chile Index* and a 6.8% decline in the IPSA
Index**, measured in U.S. dollar terms. Factors that detracted from the Fund's
relative performance during the period included not having had any exposure to a
metals and mining stock that had a strong gain in the period, rising about 70%.
In addition, the Fund's bank holdings collectively had a gain but lagged the
index's bank component. Factors that aided the Fund's relative return included
stock selection in the retail sector.

THE STOCK MARKET IN CHILE: MODESTLY DOWN DESPITE HEALTHY ECONOMY

The world's stock markets performed well over the first half of the period, but
then tumbled on worries that interest rates would begin to rise. In addition,
investor sentiment was dampened by concerns of a "hard landing" in China and by
heightened geopolitical risk factors in general. Emerging stock markets outpaced
developed markets during the initial rally, and underperformed when markets
turned down in April and May. As of the end of June many emerging markets had
positive results for the period, though the best performers were mostly small
markets and the group as a whole posted a slight loss. Within Emerging Markets,
Latin America outperformed; within Latin America the Chilean market was in the
middle of the pack.

From a fundamental point of view, we believe the economy has performed in line
with expectations. The recovery has been led by external demand, aided by high
prices for commodities and in particular copper. There are clear signs of
domestic demand picking up speed; however, the labor market remains subdued and
unemployment relatively high. Most analysts are anticipating GDP growth of
around 5% for the year. Inflation and interest rates remain at very low levels.
The peso weakened steadily throughout the first six months of the year, losing
7% of its value against the U.S. dollar. On the negative side, foreign direct
investment has fallen. The government's proposal to introduce a mining royalty
tax, aimed primarily at foreign owned mining companies, has dampened investor
sentiment generally by sending a negative signal about the government's general
approach to taxation and private sector investment.

THE PORTFOLIO AND OUTLOOK: POSITIONED FOR A RECOVERY OF DOMESTIC DEMAND

We believe that the recovery should feed through to the labor market in due
course and we remain optimistic on stocks sensitive to domestic consumption;
therefore, we were overweight in sectors such as beverages. Also on the domestic
demand theme, one noteworthy addition to the Fund was a major retailer that went
public in May (we participated in its IPO). We continue to believe that the
banking sector should benefit from an increase in domestic consumption, but we
are roughly neutrally weighted there based mainly on valuation concerns. Amongst
exporters, we have maintained exposure to exporters of wood pulp and other
forestry products, which have performed well in the current commodity price
environment.

We think that the Chilean market should be a relative beneficiary of lower
appetite for risk around the world due to its traditional "safe haven" status
and relative immunity to global capital flows. Thanks to the pension fund
system, which continues to grow and mature and which is the lifeblood of the
local capital markets, Chilean companies are increasingly

In our view, this provides a measure of downside protection in a difficult
market environment.

* The Morgan Stanley Capital International Chile Index is an unmanaged index
(with no defined investment objective) of Chilean equities that includes
reinvestment of net dividends, and is the exclusive property of Morgan Stanley
Capital International Inc. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.

** The IPSA Index is primarily a traded volume-based index. All stocks traded on
the Santiago Stock Exchange are ranked according to a liquidity-indicator proxy
called PRESENCE, which is the number of days the stock was traded, divided by
the total number of trading days. The IPSA Index includes the top 40 names,
according to this indicator. Once the components of the IPSA Index are
determined, their actual weightings in the index are calculated based on market
capitalization adjusted by traded volume.

THE CHILE FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 NOTE A. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on January 30,
1989 and commenced investment operations on September 27, 1989. The Fund is
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a
closed-end, non-diversified management investment company.

USE OF ESTIMATES: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

SECURITY VALUATION: The net asset value of the Fund is determined daily as of
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the
"Exchange") on each day the Exchange is open for business. The Fund's equity
investments are valued at market value, which is generally determined using the
closing price on the exchange or market on which the security is primarily
traded at the time of valuation (the "Valuation Time"). If no sales are
reported, equity investments are generally valued at the most recent bid
quotation as of the Valuation Time or at the lowest ask quotation in the case of
a short sale of securities. Debt securities with a remaining maturity greater
than 60 days are valued in accordance with the price supplied by a pricing
service, which may use a matrix, formula or other objective method that takes
into consideration market indices, yield curves and other specific adjustments.
Debt obligations that will mature in 60 days or less are valued on the basis of
amortized cost, which approximates market value, unless the Board of Directors
determines that using this method would not reflect an investment's value.

Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily
available or whose values have been materially affected by events occurring
before the Fund's Valuation Time, but after the close of the securities' primary
market, are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the
direction of, the Board of Directors under procedures established by the Board
of Directors. The Fund may utilize a service provided by an independent third
party which has been approved by the Board of Directors to fair value certain
securities. At June 30, 2004, the Fund held 2.49% of its net assets in a
security valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors with an aggregate cost of $4,392,311 and fair value of $3,489,687. The
Fund's estimate of fair value assumes a willing buyer and a willing seller
neither acting under a compulsion to buy or sell. Although this security may be
resold in privately negotiated transactions, the prices realized on such sales
could differ from the price originally paid by the Fund or the current carrying
value, and the difference could be material.

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT: The Fund sweeps available cash into a short-term deposit
issued by Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Fund's custodian. The short-term
time deposit is a variable rate account classified as a short-term investment.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Investment transactions are
accounted for on a trade date basis. The cost of investments sold is determined
by use of the specific identification method for both financial reporting and
U.S. income tax purposes. Interest income is accrued as earned; dividend income
is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

TAXES: No provision is made for U.S. income or excise taxes as it is the Fund's
intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company and to make
the requisite distributions to its shareholders sufficient to relieve it from
all or substantially all U.S. income and excise taxes.

THE CHILE FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund accrues foreign taxes on realized gains and repatriation taxes in an
amount equal to what the Fund would owe if the securities were sold and the
proceeds repatriated on the valuation date as a liability and reduction of
realized/unrealized gains. Taxes on foreign income are recorded when the related
income is recorded. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the Fund accrued
$132,271 of such expense.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS: The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

      (I) market value of investment securities, assets and liabilities at the
          valuation date rate of exchange; and

     (II) purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses at
          the relevant rates of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of
          such transactions.

The Fund does not isolate that portion of gains and losses on investments in
equity securities which is due to changes in the foreign exchange rates from
that which is due to changes in market prices of equity securities. Accordingly,
realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses with respect to such
securities are included in the reported net realized and unrealized gains and
losses on investment transactions balances.

The Fund reports certain foreign currency related transactions and foreign taxes
withheld on security transactions as components of realized gains for financial
reporting purposes, whereas such foreign currency related transactions are
treated as ordinary income for U.S. income tax purposes.

Net unrealized currency gains or losses from valuing foreign currency
denominated assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates are reflected as
a component of net unrealized appreciation/depreciation in value of investments,
and translation of other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies.

Net realized foreign exchange gains or losses represent foreign exchange gains
and losses from transactions in foreign currencies and forward foreign currency
contracts, exchange gains or losses realized between the trade date and
settlement date on security transactions, and the difference between the amounts
of interest and dividends recorded on the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received.

DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME AND GAINS: The Fund distributes at least annually to
shareholders substantially all of its net investment income and net realized
short-term capital gains, if any. The Fund determines annually whether to
distribute any net realized long-term capital gains in excess of net realized
short-term capital losses, including capital loss carryovers, if any. An
additional distribution may be made to the extent necessary to avoid the payment
of a 4% U.S. federal excise tax. Dividends and distributions to shareholders are
recorded by the Fund on the ex-dividend date.

The character of distributions made during the year from net investment income
or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for U.S.
income tax purposes due to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles/tax
differences in the character of income and expense recognition.

OTHER: The Fund may invest in securities of foreign countries and governments
which involve certain risks in addition to those inherent in domestic
investments. Such risks generally include, among others currency risks
(fluctuations in currency exchange rates), information risk (key information may
be inaccurate or unavailable) and political risk (expropriation, nationalization
or the imposition of capital or currency

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                              13

controls or punitive taxes). Other risks of investing in foreign securities
include liquidity and valuation risks.

Securities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in exchange rates.

The Chilean securities markets are substantially smaller, less liquid and more
volatile than the major securities markets in the United States. Consequently,
acquisition and disposition of securities by the Fund may be inhibited. A
significant proportion of the aggregate market value of equity securities listed
on the Santiago Exchange are held by a small number of investors and are not
publicly traded. This may limit the number of shares available for acquisition
or disposition by the Fund.

Investments in Chile may involve certain considerations and risks not typically
associated with investments in the United States, including the possibility of
future political and economic developments and the level of Chilean governmental
supervision and regulation of its securities markets.

The Fund, subject to local investment limitations, may invest up to 20% of its
assets (at the time of commitment) in illiquid equity securities, including
securities of private equity funds (whether in corporate or partnership form)
that invest primarily in the emerging markets. When investing through another
investment fund, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses
incurred by the fund, including management fees. Such securities are expected to
be illiquid, which may involve a high degree of business and financial risk and
may result in substantial losses. Because of the current absence of any liquid
trading market for these investments, the Fund may take longer to liquidate
these positions than would be the case for publicly traded securities. Although
these securities may be resold in privately negotiated transactions, the prices
realized on such sales could be substantially less than those originally paid by
the Fund or the current carrying values and this difference could be material.
Further, companies whose securities are not publicly traded may not be subject
to the disclosure and other investor protection requirements applicable to
companies whose securities are publicly traded.

a monthly fee that is calculated weekly at an annual rate of 0.08% of the first
$100 million of the Fund's average weekly net assets, 0.06% of the next $50
million and 0.04% of amounts in excess of $150 million. For the six months ended

Celfin Capital S.A. Administradora de Fondos de Capital Extranjero ("AFCE")
serves as the Fund's Chilean administrator. For its services, AFCE is paid a
fee, out of the advisory fee payable to CSAM, that is calculated weekly and paid
quarterly at an annual rate of 0.05% of the Fund's average weekly market value
or net assets (whichever is lower). In addition, AFCE receives a supplemental
administration fee, an annual reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses and an
accounting fee. For the six months ended June 30, 2004, the administration fees,
supplemental administration fees and accounting fees amounted to $32,101,
$35,306 and $2,983, respectively.

Merrill Corporation ("Merrill"), an affiliate of CSAM, has been engaged by the
Fund to provide certain financial printing services. For the six months ended
June 30, 2004, Merrill was paid $32,507 for its services to the Fund.

The Independent Directors receive fifty percent (50%) of their annual retainer
in the form of shares purchased by the Fund's transfer agent in the open market.
Directors as a group own less than 1% of the Fund's outstanding shares.

 NOTE C. CAPITAL STOCK

The authorized capital stock of the Fund is 100,000,000 shares of common stock,
$0.001 par value. Of the 10,139,926 shares outstanding at June 30, 2004, CSAM
owned 14,615 shares.

 NOTE D. INVESTMENT IN SECURITIES

For the six months ended June 30, 2004, purchases and sales of securities, other
than short-term investments, were $18,115,420 and $21,307,178, respectively.

 NOTE E. CREDIT FACILITY

The Fund, together with other funds/portfolios advised by CSAM (collectively,
the "Participating Funds"), participates in a $75 million committed, unsecured,
line of credit facility ("Credit Facility") with Deutsche Bank, A.G. as
administrative agent and syndication agent and State Street Bank and Trust
Company as operations agent for temporary or emergency purposes. Under the terms
of the Credit Facility, the Participating Funds pay an aggregate commitment fee
at a rate of 0.10% per annum on the average unused amount of the Credit
Facility, which is allocated among the Participating Funds in such manner as is
determined by the governing Boards of the Participating Funds. In addition, the
Participating Funds pay interest on borrowings at the Federal Funds rate plus
0.50%. The maximum amount outstanding under the Credit Facility and periodic
overdrafts for the Fund was $2,700,000 with an average daily loan balance of
$45,022 with an average daily interest rate of 1.50% during the six months ended
June 30, 2004. The Fund had no borrowings under the Credit Facility or overdraft
at June 30, 2004.

 NOTE F. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, losses
deferred due to wash sales and Post-October losses (as later defined), and
excise tax regulations.

The tax character of the dividends and distributions paid during the year ended
December 31, 2003 for the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONCLUDED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fund were ordinary income of $811,194 and long-term capital gains of $3,751,773.

Under current tax law, certain capital losses realized after October 31 within a
taxable year may be deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the
following tax year ("Post-October losses"). For the tax period ended December
31, 2003, the Fund did not incur Post-October losses.

At June 30, 2004, the identified cost for federal income tax purposes, as well
as the gross unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost, gross unrealized depreciation from
investments for those securities having an excess of cost over value and the net
unrealized appreciation from investments were $91,556,775, $52,098,654,
$(2,869,649) and $49,229,005, respectively.

 NOTE G. CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, the Fund may provide general indemnifications
pursuant to certain contracts and organizational documents. The Fund's maximum
exposure under these arrangements is dependent on future claims that may be made
against the Fund and, therefore, cannot be estimated; however, based on
experience, the risk of loss from such claims is considered remote.

 DESCRIPTION OF INVESTLINK(SM) PROGRAM (UNAUDITED)

The InvestLink(SM) Program is sponsored and administered by EquiServe, L.P., not
by The Chile Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"). EquiServe, L.P., will act as program
administrator (the "Program Administrator") of the InvestLink(SM) Program (the
"Program"). The purpose of the Program is to provide existing shareholders with
a simple and convenient way to invest additional funds and reinvest dividends in
shares of the Fund's common stock ("Shares") at prevailing prices, with reduced
brokerage commissions and fees.

In order to participate in the Program, you must be a registered holder of at
least one Share of stock of the Fund. Purchases of Shares with funds from a
participant's cash payment or automatic account deduction will begin on the next
day on which funds are invested. All cash payments must be drawn on a U.S. bank
and payable in U.S. dollars. Checks must be made payable to EquiServe. If a
participant selects the dividend reinvestment option, automatic investment of
dividends generally will begin with the next dividend payable after the Program
Administrator receives his enrollment form. Once in the Program, a person will
remain a participant until he terminates his participation or sells all Shares
held in his Program account, or his account is terminated by the Program
Administrator. A participant may change his investment options at any time by
requesting a new enrollment form and returning it to the Program Administrator.

A participant will be assessed certain charges in connection with his
participation in the Program. All optional cash deposit investments will be
subject to a service charge. Sales processed through the Program will have a
service fee deducted from the net proceeds, after brokerage commissions. In
addition to the transaction charges outlined above, participants will be
assessed per share processing fees (which include brokerage commissions.)
Participants will not be charged any fee for reinvesting dividends.

The number of Shares to be purchased for a participant depends on the amount of
his dividends, cash payments or bank account or payroll deductions, less
applicable fees and commissions, and the purchase price of the Shares. The
investment date for cash payments is the 25th day of each month (or the next
trading day if the 25th is not a trading day). The investment date for dividend
reinvestment is the dividend payment date. The Program Administrator uses
dividends and funds of participants to purchase Shares of the Fund in the open
market. Such purchases will be made by participating brokers as agent for the
participants using normal cash settlement practices. All Shares purchased
through the Program will be allocated to participants as of the settlement date,
which is usually three business days from the purchase date. In all cases,
transaction processing will occur within 30 days of the receipt of funds, except
where temporary curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply
with applicable provisions of the Federal Securities laws or when unusual market
conditions make prudent investment impracticable. In the event the Program
Administrator is unable to purchase Shares within 30 days of the receipt of
funds, such funds will be returned to the participants.

The average price of all Shares purchased by the Program Administrator with all
funds received during the time period from two business days preceding any
investment date up to the second business day preceding the next investment date
shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in connection with the
Shares purchased for his account with his funds or dividends received by the
Program Administrator during such time period. The average price of all Shares
sold by the Program Administrator pursuant to sell orders received during such
time period shall be the price per share allocable to a participant in
connection with the Shares sold for his account pursuant to his sell orders
received by the Program Administrator during such time period. All sale requests
having an anticipated market value of $100,000.00 or more are

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                              19

 DESCRIPTION OF INVESTLINK(SM) PROGRAM (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

expected to be submitted in written form. In addition, all sale requests
received by the Program Administrator within thirty (30) days of an address
change are expected to be submitted in written form.

EquiServe L.P., as Program Administrator, administers the Program for
participants, keeps records, sends statements of account to participants and
performs other duties relating to the Program. Each participant in the Program
will receive a statement of his account following each purchase of Shares. The
statements will also show the amount of dividends credited to such participant's
account (if applicable), as well as the fees paid by the participant. In
addition, each participant will receive copies of the Fund's annual and
semi-annual reports to shareholders, proxy statements and, if applicable,
dividend income information for tax reporting purposes.

If the Fund is paying dividends on the Shares, a participant will receive
dividends through the Program for all Shares held on the dividend record date on
the basis of full and fractional Shares held in his account, and for all other
Shares of the Fund registered in his name. The Program Administrator will send
checks to the participants for the amounts of their dividends that are not to be
automatically reinvested at no cost to the participants.

Shares of the Fund purchased under the Program will be registered in the name of
the accounts of the respective participants. Unless requested, the Fund will not
issue to participants certificates for Shares of the Fund purchased under the
Program. The Program Administrator will hold the Shares in book-entry form until
a Program participant chooses to withdraw his Shares or terminate his
participation in the Program. The number of Shares purchased for a participant's
account under the Program will be shown on his statement of account. This
feature protects against loss, theft or destruction of stock certificates.

A participant may withdraw all or a portion of the Shares from his Program
account by notifying the Program Administrator. After receipt of a participant's
request, the Program Administrator will issue to such participant certificates
for the whole Shares of the Fund so withdrawn or, if requested by the
participant, sell the Shares for him and send him the proceeds, less applicable
brokerage commissions, fees, and transfer taxes, if any. If a participant
withdraws all full and fractional Shares in his Program account, his
participation in the Program will be terminated by the Program Administrator. In
no case will certificates for fractional Shares be issued. The Program
Administrator will convert any fractional Shares held by a participant at the
time of his withdrawal to cash.

Participation in any rights offering, dividend distribution or stock split will
be based upon both the Shares of the Fund registered in participants' names and
the Shares (including fractional Shares) credited to participants' Program
accounts. Any stock dividend or Shares resulting from stock splits with respect
to Shares of the Fund, both full and fractional, which participants hold in
their Program accounts and with respect to all Shares registered in their names
will be automatically credited to their accounts.

All Shares of the Fund (including any fractional share) credited to his account
under the Program will be voted as the participant directs. The participants
will be sent the proxy materials for the annual meetings of shareholders. When a
participant returns an executed proxy, all of such Shares will be voted as
indicated. A participant may also elect to vote his Shares in person at the
Shareholders' meeting.

A participant will receive tax information annually for his personal records and
to help him prepare his U.S. federal income tax return. The automatic
reinvestment of dividends does not relieve him of any income tax which may be
payable on dividends. For further

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 DESCRIPTION OF INVESTLINK(SM) PROGRAM (UNAUDITED) (CONCLUDED)

information as to tax consequences of participation in the Program, participants
should consult with their own tax advisors.

The Program Administrator in administering the Program will not be liable for
any act done in good faith or for any good faith omission to act. However, the
Program Administrator will be liable for loss or damage due to error caused by
its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. Shares held in custody by the
Program Administrator are not subject to protection under the Securities
Investors Protection Act of 1970.

The participant should recognize that neither the Fund nor the Program
Administrator can provide any assurance of a profit or protection against loss
on any Shares purchased under the Program. A participant's investment in Shares
held in his Program account is no different than his investment in directly held
Shares in this regard. The participant bears the risk of loss and the benefits
of gain from market price changes with respect to all of his Shares. Neither the
Fund nor the Program Administrator can guarantee that Shares purchased under the
Program will, at any particular time, be worth more or less than their purchase
price. Each participant must make an independent investment decision based on
his own judgment and research.

While the Program Administrator hopes to continue the Program indefinitely, the
Program Administrator reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Program at
any time. It also reserves the right to make modifications to the Program.
Participants will be notified of any such suspension, termination or
modification in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Program. The
Program Administrator also reserves the right to terminate any participant's
participation in the Program at any time. Any question of interpretation arising
under the Program will be determined in good faith by the Program Administrator
and any such good faith determination will be final.

Any interested shareholder may participate in the Program. All other cash
payments or bank account deductions must be at least $100.00, up to a maximum of
$100,000.00 annually. An interested shareholder may join the Program by reading
the Program description, completing and signing the enrollment form and
returning it to the Program Administrator. The enrollment form and information
relating to the Program (including the terms and conditions) may be obtained by
calling the Program Administrator at one of the following telephone numbers:
(800) 730-6001 (U.S. and Canada) or (781) 575-3100 (outside U.S. and Canada).
All correspondence regarding the Program should be directed to: EquiServe Trust
