                              GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

                              Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                              structure combines the specialized expertise of
                              three world-class investment management
                              groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE         Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                              autonomously, relying on its own research and
                              staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                              that underlie its success.

                              FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a
                              recognized leader in fixed income investing and
                              also brings expertise in growth- and value-style
                              U.S. equity investing.

                              TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                              international investing and, in 1954, launched
                              what has become the industry's oldest global fund.
                              Today, with research offices in over 25 countries,
                              they offer investors the broadest global reach in
                              the industry.

                              MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                              dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                              searching aggressively for opportunity among
                              undervalued stocks, arbitrage situations and
                              distressed companies.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION          Because our management groups work independently
                              and adhere to distinctly different investment
                              approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series
                              funds typically have a low overlap of securities.
                              That's why our funds can be used to build truly
                              diversified portfolios covering every major asset
                              class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST     At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                              consistently provide investors with exceptional
                              risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well
                              as the reliable account services that have helped
                              us become one of the most trusted names in
                              financial services.

ANNUAL REPORT

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON
LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

YOUR FUND'S GOALS AND MAIN INVESTMENTS: Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust seeks to provide high, current income, with a secondary objective
of capital appreciation to the extent possible, through a portfolio consisting
primarily of high yield corporate bonds, floating rate bank loans and mortgage-
and other asset-backed securities.

Dear Shareholder:

This annual report for Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust covers
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the 12 months under review, Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust
posted cumulative total returns of +6.01% based on net asset value and +1.38%
based on market price. Share price, as measured by net asset value, decreased
from $14.75 per share on March 31, 2004, to $14.41 at period-end, and the market
price fell from $14.87 to $13.89 over the same period. You can find the Fund's
performance data in the Performance Summary on page 6.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Overall domestic economic growth remained healthy, with annualized quarterly
growth of gross domestic product (GDP) ranging from 4.0% to 3.1% over the past
year. In terms of drivers supporting this economic expansion, approximately
two-thirds of GDP is generated by consumer spending, and almost one-fifth by

business spending. Since consumer spending relies on consumers' ability to
remain gainfully employed, many analysts study the employment picture for
indications of consumer spending. Over the past 12 months, nonfarm payroll data,
as well as other indexes, showed growing employment. This, along with 6.0%
growth in personal income over the past year, helped consumer spending increase
by 6.1% (not adjusted for inflation) for the 12 months ended March 31, 2005,
which supported U.S. economic growth.(1)

Business spending also rose during the reporting period, contributing to
economic growth. For example, annualized nonresidential investment spending
recorded double-digit gains for most of the period before experiencing a
slowdown in its pace of growth during first quarter 2005. Historically low
interest rates and ample cash and liquidity allowed many corporations to
increase their capital investment plans to meet expected demand increases.

Domestic inflationary pressures increased over the past 12 months, driven by
economic strength as well as rising energy prices, as oil prices neared $57 a
barrel.(2) Moreover, although corporate productivity continued to grow, the
pace of productivity growth slowed from that of recent years. In this
environment, the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) raised the federal funds target
rate to 2.75% from 1.00% during the reporting period, with expectations for
further measured increases continuing in 2005. Nonetheless, with some slack
remaining in the labor force and businesses still unable in many industries to
pass along significant price increases to the consumer, nominal inflation was
relatively contained, as measured by the 2.3% rise in the core Consumer Price
Index (CPI), which excludes volatile food and energy costs. Although higher than
in the past two calendar years, this matched the core CPI's 10-year average of
2.3%.(1) With the rise in short-term interest rates, the yield curve flattened
during the period; however, longer-term interest rates, as measured by the
10-year U.S. Treasury yield, did increase, with the 10-year yield rising from
3.86% to 4.50% by period-end.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, primarily high yield
corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and mortgage- and
other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of macroeconomic trends
combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and
issuers drives our investment process. We seek to maintain a limited duration,

or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the impact that fluctuating interest
rates might have on the Fund's fixed income portfolio. Within the corporate bond
and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable valuations from
issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions, stable cash flows,
reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and
improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream and total
return through our analysis of security prepayment assumptions, pricing
inefficiencies, and underlying collateral characteristics.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

Within an environment of solid economic growth and rising interest rates, the
best performing areas of the market were those that benefit from a growing
economy, as well as securities with less interest rate sensitivity.
Consequently, among the Fund's three core investments, the high yield corporate
bond market provided the strongest relative return. Similar to high yield bonds,
bank loan issues benefited from the current economic cycle. In addition, bank
loans experienced increases in their income streams since their payouts are tied
to short-term interest rates. Conversely, the fixed-rate mortgage- and other
asset-backed sector provided the lowest, although still positive, performance
during the period, given that market segment's greater interest rate
sensitivity.

In terms of sector allocation, high yield corporate bonds represented our
largest weighting at period-end, as we believed fundamental credit trends could
provide support for such issuers. During the reporting period, default rates
edged lower largely as a result of positive corporate earnings growth and
healthy liquidity for many issuers. Valuations also became richer over the past
year, with the average yield spread over Treasuries, as measured by the CSFB
High Yield Index, declining from 5.0 percentage points at the beginning of the
period to 3.7 percentage points at period-end and touching a low of 3.0
percentage points.(3) Considering the relatively tight valuations in this
sector, we reduced our high yield corporate bond exposure from its intra-period
highs; however, it remained our largest exposure given our fundamental view of
the sector and the high yield market's lower interest rate sensitivity.

Buoyed by strong demand, the bank loan market was well supported over the past
year. As in the high yield corporate bond market, investors seemed to take
comfort in a low default rate environment. In addition, the prospect for higher
short-term interest rates, which could increase the yield and potential total
return

in the floating rate loan market, also attracted investors to this sector.
Although new-issue supply increased in conjunction with funding requirements
amid a rising volume of leveraged buyout transactions, overall demand appeared
to exceed supply. Consequently, yield spreads over LIBOR, a short-term interest
rate used to set rates in the bank loan sector, narrowed during the period.
Given the bank loan market's very low duration, as well as the positive credit
environment for bank loan issuers, we increased our exposure to bank loans
during the period, and they represented the Fund's second-largest weighting at
period-end.

In the mortgage- and other asset-backed securities sector, rising interest rates
during the period dampened overall total returns. Within this sector, we sought
opportunities to invest in securities we believed offered value based upon our
assessment of the prepayment risk for those securities. We also tended to favor
higher-coupon securities, which generally have less prepayment risk and exhibit
shorter duration than their lower-coupon counterparts. In the floating rate,
asset-backed securities sector, the Fund's holdings benefited from higher
short-term interest rates, which led to increased income from such securities.
Overall, our exposure to this sector remained relatively flat during the Fund's
fiscal year.

We took profits in certain non-dollar, foreign government bond holdings during
the period, while initiating positions in local currency Polish government bonds
and floating-rate government bonds of Argentina. Consistent with our strategy,
we made such investments based upon our view of the potential appreciation of
the Polish zloty against the U.S. dollar, as well as Argentina's favorable
economic trends as the country emerges from its recent debt restructuring.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers you a prompt and
simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions
("Distributions") in shares of the Fund. PFPC, Inc. (the "Agent"), P.O. Box
43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027, will act as your Agent in administering the
Plan. The Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in the same name as
your outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and Conditions of the
Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained from the Fund at the
address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rate share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants should note that they will not
be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares at a specific time or at a
specific price. The Agent may make open-market purchases on any securities
exchange where shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions, may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.

The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
the American Stock Exchange, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that
date,


8 | Annual Report
<PAGE>

then the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange on
such date. The net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the
amount most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or will misconduct or that of its
employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest. The
Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants in the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve your of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the
acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of the Fund, no certificates for a fractional
share will be issued. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to
your account. If you terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will
adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of
shares at the time of termination.


                                                               Annual Report | 9
<PAGE>

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the
Agent in writing at the address above or by telephone at 1-800/331-1710. Such
termination will be effective with respect to a Distribution if the Agent
receives your notice prior to the Distribution record date. The Agent or the
Fund may terminate the Plan upon notice to you in writing mailed at least 30
days prior to any record date for the payment of any Distribution. Upon any
termination, the Agent will issue, without charge, stock certificates for all
full shares you own and will convert any fractional shares you hold at the time
of termination to cash at current market price and send you a check for the
proceeds.

The Fund or the Agent may amend the Plan. You will receive written notice at
least 30 days before the effective date of any amendment.

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON
LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (the Fund) is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end investment
company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities, mortgage pass-through securities, other
mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

Senior secured corporate loans with floating or variable interest rates
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
loan dealers and other financial institutions, and information with respect to
bond and note transactions, to assist in determining a current market value for
each security. The Fund's pricing services use independent market quotations
from loan dealers or financial institutions and may incorporate valuation
methodologies that consider multiple bond characteristics such as dealer quotes,
issuer type, coupon, maturity, weighted average maturity, interest rate spreads
and yield curves, cash flow and credit risk/quality analysis to determine
current value.

Foreign securities are valued as of the close of trading on the foreign stock
exchange on which the security is primarily traded, or the NYSE, whichever is
earlier. If no sale is reported at that time, the foreign security will be
valued within the range of the most recent quoted bid and ask prices. The value
is then converted into its U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign exchange rate
in effect at the close of the NYSE on the day that the value of the foreign
security is determined.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Some methods


                                                              Annual Report | 23

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON
LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

A. SECURITY VALUATION (CONTINUED)

for valuing these securities may include: fundamental analysis, matrix pricing,
discounts from market prices of similar securities, or discounts applied due to
the nature and duration of restrictions on the disposition of the securities.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of such securities, the fair
values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a
ready market for such investments existed. Occasionally, events occur between
the time at which trading in a security is completed and the close of the NYSE
that might call into question the availability (including the reliability) of
the value of a portfolio security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the
securities may be valued using fair value procedures, which may include the use
of independent pricing services. All security valuation procedures are approved
by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED, DELAYED DELIVERY, OR TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery, or
to-be-announced (TBA) basis, with payment and delivery scheduled for a future
date. These transactions are subject to market fluctuations and are subject to
the risk that the value at delivery may be more or less than the trade date
purchase price. Although the Fund will generally purchase these securities with
the intention of holding the securities, it may sell the securities before the
settlement date. Sufficient assets have been segregated for these securities.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.

E. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Senior secured corporate loans often
require prepayment of principle from excess cash flows or at the discretion of
the borrower. As a result, actual maturity may be substantially less than the
stated maturity.

Senior secured corporate loans in which the Fund invests are generally readily
marketable, but may be subject to some restrictions on resale.

F. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under Sub Chapter M of the Internal
Revenue Code and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income. Fund
distributions to shareholders are determined on an income tax basis and may
differ from net investment income and realized gains for financial reporting
purposes.

G. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Discounts and premiums
on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the respective
securities. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

H. OFFERING COSTS

Offering costs are charged to paid-in-capital upon the initial sale of Fund
shares.


                                                              Annual Report | 25

LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

I. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the
Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

On August 27, 2003, the Fund completed the initial public offering. On September
25, 3003 and October 14, 2003, the Fund issued additional shares in connection
with the exercise of the underwriters' over allotment allocation option. Shares
were issued at $15.00 per share before the underwriters discount of $0.675 per
share. The Fund's manager agreed in advance to assume as its own expense all
offering and organizational expenses in excess of $0.03 per share, excluding the
underwriters' discount.

Transactions in the Fund's common shares were as follows:

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended March 31, 2005
and 2004, were as follows:
                                                ---------------------------
                                                    2005            2004

Distributions paid from ordinary income....     $ 35,179,871  $  16,644,549

At March 31, 2005, the Fund had deferred capital losses occurring subsequent to
October 31, 2004 of $640,417. For tax purposes, such losses will be reflected in
the year ending March 31, 2006.

Net investment income (loss) differs for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, paydown
losses, and bond discount and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, paydown losses, and bond discount and premiums.

7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short-term securities) for the
year ended March 31, 2005 aggregated $312,310,553 and $314,313,263,
respectively.

8. INVESTMENTS IN FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the
Sweep Money Fund.

9. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 67.27% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities may be unsecured and
subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

10. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrowers' discretion.

At March 31, 2005, unfunded commitments were as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfunded loan commitments are marked to market daily and any unrealized gain or
loss is included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and Statement of
Operations.

11. REGULATORY MATTERS

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS

As part of various investigations by a number of federal, state, and foreign
regulators and governmental entities, including the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"), the California Attorney General's Office ("CAGO"), and the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD"), relating to certain
practices in the mutual fund industry, including late trading, market timing and
marketing support payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares, Franklin
Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (as used in this section,
together, the "Company"), as well as certain current or former executives and
employees of the Company, provided documents and information in response to
subpoenas and/or requests for documents, information and/or testimony. Beginning
in August 2004, the Company entered into settlements with certain of the
regulators and a governmental entity investigating the mutual fund industry
practices noted above. The Company believes that settlement of each of the
matters is in the best interest of the Company and shareholders of the Franklin,
Templeton, and Mutual Series mutual funds (the "funds").

INVESTIGATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS (CONTINUED)

Two of the settlement agreements, those with the SEC and the CAGO concerning
marketing support payments, provide that the distribution of settlement monies
are to be made to the relevant funds, not to individual shareholders. The CAGO
has approved the distribution plan pertaining to the distribution of the monies
owed under the CAGO settlement agreement and, in accordance with the terms and
conditions of that settlement, the monies were disbursed to the participating
funds. The Fund did not participate in the CAGO settlement. The SEC has not yet
approved the distribution plan pertaining to the SEC settlement. When approved,
disbursements of settlement monies under the SEC's settlement will be made
promptly in accordance with the terms and conditions of that order.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On April 12, 2005, the Attorney General of West Virginia filed a complaint in
the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia against a number of
companies engaged in the mutual fund industry, including Franklin Resources,
Inc. and its subsidiary, Franklin Advisers, Inc., and certain other parties
alleging violations of the West Virginia Consumer Credit and Protection Act and
seeking, among other things, civil penalties and attorneys' fees and costs. To
the extent applicable to the Company, the complaint arises from activity that
occurred in 2001 and duplicates, in whole or in part, the allegations asserted
in the February 4, 2004 Massachusetts Administrative Complaint concerning one
instance of market timing (the "Administrative Complaint") and the SEC's
findings regarding market timing in its August 2, 2004 Order (the "SEC Order"),
both of which matters were previously reported.

The Company, and other funds, and certain current and former officers,
employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits in different
courts alleging violations of various federal securities laws and seeking, among
other relief, monetary damages, restitution, removal of fund trustees,
directors, advisers, administrators, and distributors, rescission of management
contracts and 12b-1 plans, and/or attorneys' fees and costs. Specifically, the
lawsuits claim breach of duty with respect to alleged arrangements to permit
market timing and/or late trading activity, or breach of duty with respect to
the valuation of the portfolio securities of certain Templeton funds managed by
Franklin Resources, Inc. subsidiaries, resulting in alleged market timing
activity. The majority of these lawsuits duplicate, in whole or in part, the
allegations asserted in the Administrative Complaint and the SEC's findings
regarding market timing in the SEC Order. The lawsuits are styled as class
actions, or derivative actions on behalf of either the named funds or Franklin
Resources, Inc.

11. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTINUED)

In addition, the Company, as well as certain current and former officers,
employees, and directors, have been named in multiple lawsuits alleging
violations of various securities laws and pendent state law claims relating to
the disclosure of marketing support payments and/or payment of allegedly
excessive commissions and/or advisory or distribution fees, and seeking, among
other relief, monetary damages, restitution, rescission of advisory contracts,
including recovery of all fees paid pursuant to those contracts, an accounting
of all monies paid to the named advisers, declaratory relief, injunctive relief,
and/or attorneys' fees and costs. These lawsuits are styled as class actions or
derivative actions brought on behalf of the Fund and other funds.

The Company and fund management strongly believe that the claims made in each of
the lawsuits described above are without merit and intends to defend against
them vigorously. The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome
of these lawsuits, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the
Company. Public trust and confidence are critical to the Company's business and
any material loss of investor and/or client confidence could result in a
significant decline in assets under management by the Company, which would have
an adverse effect on future financial results. If it is determined that the
Company bears responsibility for any unlawful or inappropriate conduct that
caused losses to the Fund, it is committed to making the Fund or its
shareholders whole, as appropriate. The Company is committed to taking all
appropriate actions to protect the interests of its funds' shareholders.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF
FRANKLIN TEMPLETON LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust (the "Fund") at March 31, 2005, the results of its operations for
the year then ended and the changes in its net assets and the financial
highlights for each of the periods presented, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial
statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at March 31, 2005 by
correspondence with the custodian, agent banks and brokers, provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

FRANKLIN TEMPLETON
LIMITED DURATION INCOME TRUST

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT

At a meeting held February 28, 2005, the Board of Trustees ("Board"), including
a majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment advisory contract for the Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income
Trust (the "Fund"). In reaching this decision, the Board took into account
information furnished throughout the year at regular Board meetings, as well as
information prepared specifically in connection with the annual renewal review
process. Information furnished and discussed throughout the year included
reports on the Fund, the share price premium or discount to net asset value, the
results of investment performance and related financial information for the
Fund, as well as periodic reports on legal compliance, pricing, brokerage
commissions and execution and other services provided by the Investment Manager
("Manager") and its affiliates. Information furnished specifically in connection
with the renewal process included a report prepared by Lipper Financial Services
("Lipper"), an independent organization, as well as a Fund profitability
analysis report prepared by management. The Lipper reports compared the Fund's
investment performance and expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable
to the Fund as selected by Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report
discussed the profitability to Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall
U.S. fund operations, as well as on an individual fund-by-fund basis utilizing
expense allocation methodologies deemed reasonable by the Fund's independent
accountants. Included with such profitability analysis report was information on
a fund-by-fund basis listing portfolio managers and other accounts they manage,
as well as information on management fees charged by the Manager including
management's explanation of differences where relevant, as well as an expense
analysis with an explanation for any increase in expense ratios. Additional
information accompanying such report were a memorandum prepared by management
describing enhancements to the services provided to the funds by the Franklin
Templeton Investments organization, as well as a memorandum relating to
economies of scale.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment advisory contract for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment advisory contract was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. The following discusses factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICE. The Board believes the overall services
provided by the Manager and its affiliates to the Fund and its shareholders to
be of high quality. In addition to investment performance and expenses discussed
below, such belief is based, in part, upon periodic reports furnished the Board
showing that the investment policies and restrictions for the Fund were
consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically furnished the
Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio managers and other
management personnel with the code of ethics adopted throughout the Franklin
Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value pricing procedures
established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value calculations.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACT (CONTINUED)

Favorable consideration was given to management's efforts and expenditures in
establishing back-up systems and recovery procedures to function in the event of
a natural disaster, it being noted by the Board that such systems and procedures
had been favorably reported on in discussions with the Fund's outside
accountants and had functioned smoothly during the hurricanes and blackout
experienced last year in Florida. Other factors taken into account by the Board
were the Manager's best execution trading policies, including a favorable third
party report on portfolio execution, as well as the quality of the compliance
procedures and Chief Compliance Officer established in accordance with recently
adopted SEC requirements. Consideration was also given to the experience of the
Fund's portfolio management team, the number of accounts managed and general
method of compensation. In this latter respect, the Board noted that a primary
factor in management's determination of the level of a portfolio manager's bonus
compensation was the relative investment performance of the funds he or she
managed so as to be aligned with the interests of Fund shareholders.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Particular Board emphasis was given to the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. In assessing
such performance, the Board considered a Lipper report prepared for the Fund
showing its investment performance in comparison with a performance universe
consisting of four closed end BBB rated corporate debt funds selected by Lipper.
The Board noted that the Fund's income return of 8.4% as shown in the Lipper
report, and total return of 9.02% during such year placed it in the fourth and
fifth highest quintiles, respectively, within such performance universe. In
discussing such performance, management pointed out that some of the funds in
the Lipper performance universe did not follow the same limited duration,
multi-sector investment strategy as the Fund and that the Fund's total return
during 2004 was the highest when compared to two other leveraged closed end
funds which followed a similar strategy. In view of this explanation and taking
into account the actual level of the Fund's 9.02% return during the period shown
and the fact that it had not been in existence for more than a year, the Board
found such performance to be satisfactory.

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with an expense
group of the Fund and three other non-leveraged closed end BBB rated corporate
debt funds as selected by Lipper. Prior to making such comparison, the Board
relied upon a survey showing that the scope of management advisory services
covered under the Fund's investment advisory contract were similar to those
provided by fund managers to other fund groups which would be used as a basis of
comparison in the Lipper reports. In reviewing comparative costs, emphasis was
given to the Fund's management fee in comparison with the effective management
fee that would have been charged by other funds within its Lipper expense group
assuming they were the same size as the Fund, as well as the actual total
expenses of the Fund in comparison with those of its peer group. The results of
such expense comparisons showed that the Fund's effective management fee rate
and total expenses were in each

case the third highest in such Lipper expense group. The Lipper report also
noted that the Fund was the second smallest fund in the expense group with the
smallest fund having the highest total expense and that the Fund's total
expenses were less than ten basis points above the group median. The Board found
such expenses to be acceptable.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
each of the individual funds. The Board also considered the extent to which the
Manager and its affiliates might derive ancillary benefits from fund operations,
as well as potential benefits resulting from allocation of fund brokerage and
the use of "soft" commission dollars to pay for research. Specific attention was
given to the methodology followed in allocating costs to the Fund, it being
recognized that allocation methodologies are inherently subjective and various
allocation methodologies may each be reasonable while producing different
results. In this respect, the Board noted that the cost allocation methodology
was consistent with that followed in profitability report presentations made in
prior years and that such methodology was subject to review and testing by the
Fund's outside accountants every other year. It was also noted that legal costs
and payments incurred by Franklin Templeton in resolving various legal
proceedings arising from its U.S. fund operations had not been allocated to the
Fund for purposes of determining profitability. Included in the analysis were
the revenue and related costs involved in managing the Fund, as well as its
relative contribution to the profitability of the Manager's parent. In reviewing
and discussing such analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief
that costs incurred in establishing the infrastructure necessary to the type of
mutual fund operations conducted by the Manager and its corporate affiliates may
not be fully reflected in the expenses allocated to the Fund in determining its
profitability, as well as the fact that the level of profits, to a certain
extent, reflected operational cost savings and efficiencies initiated by
management. In addition, the Board considered a third party study comparing the
profitability of the Manager's parent on an overall basis as compared to other
publicly held managers broken down to show profitability from management
operations exclusive of distribution expenses, as well as profitability
including distribution expenses. Based upon their consideration of all these
factors, the Board determined that the level of profits realized by the Manager
under its investment advisory contract with the Fund was not excessive in view
of the nature, quality and extent of services provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. Since the Fund is a closed end fund and does not
continuously offer shares to the public, any increase in the Fund's size will
result from appreciation in its investment portfolio which benefits shareholders
by increasing the value of their investments in the Fund. In view of this fact,
the Board did not consider whether economies of scale are realized and shared by
the Manager since it is believed that such consideration is meaningful only in
the case of an open end fund whose growth may reflect additional sales of fund
shares rather than through any asset appreciation that benefits its
shareholders.

      (iii)pre-approval of all non-audit related services to be provided to the
registrant by the auditors to the registrant's investment adviser or to any
entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the
registrant's investment adviser and that provides ongoing services to the
registrant where the non-audit services relate directly to the operations or
financial reporting of the registrant; and

      (iv) establishment by the audit committee, if deemed necessary or
appropriate, as an alternative to committee pre-approval of services to be
provided by the auditors, as required by paragraphs (ii) and (iii) above, of
policies and procedures to permit such services to be pre-approved by other
means, such as through establishment of guidelines or by action of a designated
member or members of the committee; provided the policies and procedures are
detailed as to the particular service and the committee is informed of each
service and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of audit
committee responsibilities, as contemplated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, to management; subject, in the case of (ii) through (iv), to any waivers,
exceptions or exemptions that may be available under applicable law or rules.

(e) (2) None of the services provided to the registrant described in paragraphs
(b)-(d) of Item 4 were pre-approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraph
(c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of regulation S-X.

(f) No disclosures are required by this Item 4(f).

(g) The aggregate non-audit fees paid to the principal accountant for services
rendered by the principal accountant to the registrant and the registrant's
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant were $25,253 for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2005 and $151,489
for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.

(h) The registrant's audit committee of the board of trustees has considered
whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

      ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS. Members of the Audit
Committee are: Robert F. Carlson, S. Joseph Fortunato and Frank W.T. LaHaye.

      ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS. N/A

      ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES. The Board has delegated the
authority to vote proxies related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund
to the Fund's manager Franklin Advisers, Inc. (Advisers) in accordance with the
Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the Proxy
Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with
the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. All conflicts are resolved in
the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the manager
perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's board of trustees; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of trustees, ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services; or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES

The manager has adopted general proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized
below. These guidelines are not an exhaustive list of all the issues that may
arise and the manager cannot anticipate all future situations. In all cases,
each proxy will be considered based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS. In light of several high profile accounting scandals,
the manager will closely scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a
case-by-case basis, the manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit
relationships and non-audit fees. The manager will also consider, on a
case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and will vote against the
ratification of auditors when there is clear and compelling evidence of
accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT & DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans and/or the Glass Lewis
evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

Changes to capital structure. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

INVESTMENT COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS. N/A

      ITEM 9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS. There have
been no changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend nominees
to the Registrant's Board of Trustees that would require disclosure herein.

      ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

      CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Dated July 2004

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------


                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1

          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;

          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and

          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;



- -----------------------------
1 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2 Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.







     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin   Resources'  General  Counsel  and  Deputy  General  Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented  under  it and  have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will  consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.


- -----------------

3 Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.






     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.


- ---------------------

5 See Part X.






IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet

undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.
