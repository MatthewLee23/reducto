To the Members and Board of Directors of
        UBS Technology Fund, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS Technology Fund, L.L.C.  (the "Fund"),  including the schedule of
portfolio  investments,  as of December 31, 2006,  and the related  statement of
operations  and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of changes
in members'  capital  for each of the two years in the period then ended.  These
financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Fund's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the  Fund's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Our  audit
included  consideration of internal control over financial  reporting as a basis
for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the  circumstances,  but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness of the Fund's
internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes examining,  on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2006 by correspondence  with
the custodian and others or by the other appropriate  auditing  procedures where
replies  from others were not  received.  We believe  that our audits  provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects,  the financial position of UBS Technology Fund, L.L.C. at
December 31, 2006, the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year
then ended and the changes in its members'  capital for each of the two years in
the period then ended, in conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting
principles.

                                                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     1.   ORGANIZATION

          UBS Technology  Partners,  L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized
          as a limited  partnership  under the laws of Delaware on December  28,
          1998 and was subsequently  reorganized as a limited  liability company
          effective   October  15,  2002.  The  Fund  is  registered  under  the
          Investment  Company Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940  Act"),  as a
          closed-end, non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund's
          investment  objective  is to maximize  capital  appreciation  over the
          long-term.  The Fund pursues its investment objective by deploying its
          assets primarily among a select group of portfolio managers who invest
          primarily in, or who have particular  knowledge within, the technology
          sector.  Generally,  such portfolio  managers conduct their investment
          programs  through  unregistered  investment funds  (collectively,  the
          "Investment  Funds") in which the Fund invests as a limited partner or
          member along with other  investors.  The Fund commenced  operations on
          April 1, 1999.

          The  Fund's  Board  of  Directors   (the   "Directors")   has  overall
          responsibility to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund,
          including the exclusive authority to oversee and to establish policies
          regarding  the  management,   conduct  and  operation  of  the  Fund's
          business.  The Directors  have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the
          "UBSFA" or "Manager"),  a Delaware limited  liability  company and the
          Manager  of the Fund,  to  provide  investment  advice  regarding  the
          selection of Investment Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day
          management of the Fund.

          The Manager is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas, Inc.,
          which is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS AG, and is registered as an
          investment  adviser  under the  Investment  Advisers  Act of 1940,  as
          amended.

          Initial  and  additional   applications   for  interests  by  eligible
          investors  may be accepted at such times as the Manager may  determine
          and are  generally  accepted  monthly.  The Fund reserves the right to
          reject any application for interests in the Fund.

          The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests pursuant
          to written tenders to Members.  These repurchases will be made at such
          times and on such  terms as may be  determined  by the  Directors,  in
          their  complete and  exclusive  discretion.  The Manager  expects that
          generally,  it will  recommend to the Directors that the Fund offer to
          repurchase  interests  from Members twice in each year,  near mid-year
          and  year-end.  Members can only  transfer or assign their  membership
          interests,  or a portion thereof,  (i) by operation of law pursuant to
          the death, bankruptcy,  insolvency or dissolution of a Member, or (ii)
          with the written  approval of the Directors,  which may be withheld in
          their sole and absolute discretion. Such transfers may be made even if
          the balance of the capital  account to such  transferee is equal to or
          less than the transferor's initial capital contribution.

     2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

          A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

          Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction of
          the  Manager  as of the  close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal
          period in accordance with the valuation  principles set forth below or
          as  may  be  determined   from  time  to  time  pursuant  to  policies
          established by the Directors.


                                                                               6

                                               SCHEDULE OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

          A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

          The Fund's  investments  in Investment  Funds are subject to the terms
          and  conditions of the  respective  operating  agreements and offering
          memoranda, as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment Funds
          are  carried  at fair  value  as  determined  by the  Fund's  pro-rata
          interest in the net assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations
          utilize financial information supplied by each Investment Fund and are
          net of  management  and  performance  incentive  fees  or  allocations
          payable  to  the  Investment   Funds'  managers  or  pursuant  to  the
          Investment Funds' agreements.  The Fund's valuation procedures require
          the Manager to consider all relevant information available at the time
          the Fund values its  portfolio.  The Manager and/or the Directors will
          consider such information and consider  whether it is appropriate,  in
          light of all relevant  circumstances,  to value such a position at its
          net asset  value as  reported  or whether to adjust  such  value.  The
          underlying  investments of each  Investment  Fund are accounted for at
          fair  value  as  described  in  each   Investment   Fund's   financial
          statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments)

          Distributions  received or withdrawals from Investment Funds,  whether
          in the form of cash or securities, are first applied as a reduction of
          the investment's cost.

          B.   INCOME RECOGNITION

          Interest  income is recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains and
          losses  from  Investment  Fund  transactions  are  calculated  on  the
          identified cost basis.

          C.   FUND COSTS

          The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business,  including,  but
          not  limited  to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to
          portfolio  transactions  and positions for the Fund's  account;  legal
          fees; accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing
          the Fund's net asset value; costs of insurance; registration expenses;
          certain  organization  costs;  due  diligence,  including  travel  and
          related expenses;  expenses of meetings of Directors and Members;  all
          costs with respect to  communications  to Members;  and other types of
          expenses  approved  by the  Directors.  Offering  costs are charged to
          capital as incurred.

          D.   INCOME TAXES

          No provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes
          has been  provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each
          Member is  individually  required  to report on its own tax return its
          distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.


                                                                               7

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


     2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

          E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

          Cash and cash equivalents consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank, NA
          account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at cost
          plus accrued interest which is included in interest  receivable on the
          Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

          F.   REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

          From time to time the Fund may enter into  repurchase  agreements.  In
          connection  with such  transactions  it is the Fund's  policy that its
          Custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities, the
          fair value of which  exceeds the  principal  amount of the  repurchase
          transaction,  including accrued interest,  at all times. If the seller
          defaults,  and the fair value of the collateral declines,  realization
          of the  collateral  by the  Fund  may be  delayed  or  limited.  As of
          December 31, 2006, there were no outstanding repurchase agreements.

          G.   USE OF ESTIMATES

          The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with U.S.
          generally accepted accounting  principles requires the Manager to make
          estimates  and  assumptions  that affect the  amounts  reported in the
          financial statements and accompanying notes. The Manager believes that
          the estimates  utilized in preparing the Fund's  financial  statements
          are reasonable and prudent;  however, actual results could differ from
          these estimates.

     3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

          UBSFA provides certain management and  administrative  services to the
          Fund, including,  among other things, providing office space and other
          support services.  In consideration  for such services,  the Fund pays
          UBSFA a monthly  management fee (the "Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of
          the Fund's net assets,  excluding assets attributable to the Manager's
          capital account. The Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's assets and
          debited against the Members' capital accounts, excluding the Manager's
          capital  account.  A  portion  of the  fee is  paid  by  UBSFA  to its
          affiliates.

          UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
          UBS Americas,  Inc., acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without
          special compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated
          with its  activities  as  placement  agent.  Placement  fees,  if any,
          charged on contributions are debited against the contribution amounts,
          to arrive at a net  subscription  amount.  The  placement fee does not
          constitute assets of the Fund.

          The net  increase  (or  decrease)  in members'  capital  derived  from
          operations (net income or loss) is initially  allocated to the capital
          accounts of all Members on a pro-rata basis,  other than the Fee which
          is  similarly  allocated  to all  Members  other  than the  Manager as
          described  above.  In accordance  with the Limited  Liability  Company
          Agreement, the Manager is then allocated an amount based on the


                                                                               8

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

          performance of the Fund (the "Performance  Bonus") for the Measurement
          Period,  as defined in the Confidential  Memorandum  (i.e., the period
          commencing  on the admission of a Member to the Fund,  and  thereafter
          each  period  commencing  on the day  following  the last  Measurement
          Period  and  ending  generally  on the  first to occur of (1) a fiscal
          year-end or (2) a whole or partial redemption).  The Performance Bonus
          is calculated separately with respect to each Member.

          The  Performance  Bonus is equal to 1% of the balance of the  Member's
          capital  account at the end of the Measurement  Period,  provided that
          appreciation  in the Member's  capital account (net of any Performance
          Bonus) exceeds the Member's  threshold return. The threshold return is
          the amount that a Member would have earned for a fiscal year if it had
          received an  annualized  rate of return of 20% on its opening  capital
          account balance, as adjusted.  No Performance Bonus was earned for the
          year ended December 31, 2006.

          Each Director of the Fund receives a retainer of $7,500 plus a fee for
          each meeting  attended.  All Directors are  reimbursed by the Fund for
          all reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses.  Total amounts expensed by the
          Fund  related to Directors  for the year ended  December 31, 2006 were
          $29,195.

          Other  investment  partnerships  sponsored  by  UBS  Americas  or  its
          affiliates  may also maintain  investment  interests in the Investment
          Funds owned by the Fund.


     4.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

          PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as custodian
          (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides custodial services
          for the Fund.

          PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as  Administrator
          and Accounting Agent to the Fund and in that capacity provides certain
          administrative,  accounting,  record keeping, tax and investor related
          services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee primarily  based upon (i)
          the average net assets of the Fund,  subject to a minimum monthly fee,
          and (ii) the  aggregate  net  assets  of the  Fund and  certain  other
          investment  funds  sponsored  or advised by UBS  Americas,  Inc. or it
          affiliates.  Additionally,  the Fund reimburses  certain out of pocket
          expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

     5.   CREDIT FACILITY

          Effective  July 1, 2006,  the Fund,  along  with  other UBS  sponsored
          funds, entered into a $200,000,000 committed, unsecured revolving line
          of  credit  with  Harris  Trust  and  Savings  Bank.  Under  the  most
          restrictive  arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount that combined
          with the other  borrowings of the Fund would not exceed 20% of its net
          assets.  The Fund's borrowing  capacity is also limited to the portion
          of the  unused  line of credit at any point in time.  The Fund is only
          liable  under the line of credit  to the  extent of its own  borrowing
          there  under.  The  interest  rate on the  borrowing  is  based on the
          Federal  Funds rate plus 150 basis  points per annum.  The  expiration

     6.   SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

          Aggregate  purchases  and  sales of  Investment  Funds  for  the  year
          ended  December  31, 2006,  amounted  to $17,123,496 and  $41,946,838,
          respectively.


          The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax purposes is adjusted
          for items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the Investment
          Funds.  The  allocated  taxable  income is reported to the Fund by the
          Investment  Funds on Schedule  K-1.  The Fund has not yet received all
          such Schedule K-1's for the year ended December 31, 2006.

     7.   INVESTMENTS

          As of December 31, 2006, the Fund had investments in Investment Funds,
          none of  which  were  related  parties.  The  Fund's  investments  are
          summarized  below based on the  investment  objectives of the specific
          Investment Funds at December 31, 2006.

               Investment Objective            Cost             Fair Value
               --------------------            ----             ----------
                Long/Short Equity          $142,450,000        $267,431,030

          The agreements  related to investments in Investment Funds provide for
          compensation  to  the  general   partners/managers   in  the  form  of
          management  fees of 1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance
          incentive fees or allocations of 20% of net profits  earned.  Detailed
          information about the Investment Funds' portfolios is not available.

     8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

          In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the
          Fund  invests  trade  various  financial  instruments  and enter  into
          various  investment  activities  with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These
          include,  but are not limited to, short  selling  activities,  writing
          option  contracts,  contracts for  differences,  and equity swaps. The
          Fund's risk of loss in these  Investment Funds is limited to the value
          of these investments as reported by the Fund.

     9.   INDEMNIFICATION

          In the ordinary course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts
          or agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future
          events  could  occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions
          against  the Fund.  Based on its history  and  experience,  management
          feels the likelihood of such an event is remote.




                                                                              10

     10.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

          A.   FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48
               (FIN 48)

          On July 13, 2006,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB)
          released FASB  Interpretation  No. 48 "Accounting  for  Uncertainty in
          Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax
          positions should be recognized,  measured,  presented and disclosed in
          the  financial  statements.  FIN 48  requires  the  evaluation  of tax
          positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the
          Fund's  tax  returns  to  determine  whether  the  tax  positions  are
          "more-likely-than-not"  of  being  sustained  by  the  applicable  tax
          authority.  Tax positions not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not
          threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current
          year.  Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal years beginning after
          December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the
          effective   date.  At  this  time,   management   is  evaluating   the
          implications of FIN 48 and its impact on the financial  statements has
          not yet been determined.

          B.   STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157 (FAS 157)

          On  September  20,  2006,  the FASB  released  Statement  of Financial
          Accounting  Standards No. 157 "Fair Value  Measurements"  ("FAS 157").
          FAS 157 establishes an  authoritative  definition of fair value,  sets
          out a framework  for  measuring  fair value,  and requires  additional
          disclosures about fair-value measurements.  The application of FAS 157
          is required for fiscal  years  beginning  after  November 15, 2007 and
          interim periods within those fiscal years. At this time, management is
          evaluating the implications of FAS 157 and its impact on the financial
          statements has not yet been determined.

                         UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C.
                              RIDER FOR 2006 N-CSR
                              --------------------

         The Directors (including the Independent  Directors) last evaluated the
Investment  Advisory Agreement at a meeting on September 14, 2006. The Directors
met in an  executive  session  during  which  they were  advised  by and had the
opportunity  to discuss  with  independent  legal  counsel  the  approval of the
Investment Advisory Agreement. The Directors reviewed materials furnished by the
Adviser,  including  information  regarding the Adviser,  its affiliates and its
personnel, operations and financial condition. Tables indicating comparative fee
information,  and  comparative  performance  information,  as well as a  summary
financial analysis for the Fund, were also included in the meeting materials and
were reviewed and discussed. The Directors discussed with representatives of the
Adviser the Fund's  operations and the Adviser's ability to provide advisory and
other services to the Fund.

         The Directors reviewed,  among other things, the nature of the advisory
services to be provided to the Fund by the  Adviser,  including  its  investment
process,  and the  experience  of the  investment  advisory and other  personnel
proposing to provide  services to the Fund. The Directors  discussed the ability
of the Adviser to manage the Fund's  investments  in accordance  with the Fund's
stated  investment  objectives  and  policies,  as  well as the  services  to be
provided by the Adviser to the Fund,  including  administrative  and  compliance
services,  oversight  of Fund  accounting,  marketing  services,  assistance  in
meeting legal and regulatory  requirements and other services  necessary for the
operation of the Fund. The Directors  acknowledged  the Adviser's  employment of
highly skilled investment  professionals,  research analysts and administrative,
legal and  compliance  staff  members to ensure  that a high level of quality in
compliance  and  administrative  services  would be  provided  to the Fund.  The
Directors also recognized the benefits which the Fund derives from the resources
available to the Adviser and the Adviser's affiliates,  including UBS AG and UBS
Financial Services Inc. ("UBS Financial").  Accordingly, the Directors felt that
the quality of service offered by the Adviser to the Fund was  appropriate,  and
that the Adviser's personnel had sufficient expertise to manage the Fund.

         The Directors  reviewed the  performance  of the Fund and compared that
performance to the performance of another  investment  company  presented by UBS
Financial  which has objectives and strategies  similar to those of the Fund and
is managed by another,  third-party  investment adviser (the "Comparable Fund").
The Directors determined that the Fund's performance significantly exceeded that
of its Comparable  Fund,  both since inception and for 2006 through July 31. The
Directors  also compared the  volatility  of the Fund to that of its  Comparable
Fund.  The  Directors  observed that the Fund's  volatility  was higher than the
volatility of its Comparable Fund.

          The Directors considered the fees being charged by the Adviser for its
services to the Fund as compared to those charged to the Comparable Fund, and as
compared to the  management  and  incentive  fees  charged by UBS Fund  Advisor,
L.L.C.  ("UBSFA")  and its  affiliates  for  other  UBS  alternative  investment
products.  The information presented to the Directors showed that the management
fee being charged to the Fund was lower than the management fee being charged to
its  Comparable  Fund,  and the  hurdle  rate  to be  reached  before  incentive
allocations would be made was  significantly  higher than that of its Comparable
Fund. In comparing the management and incentive fees being

<PAGE>

charged to the Fund to the fees being  charged by UBSFA and its  affiliates  for
other UBS  alternative  investment  products,  the  Directors  observed that the
management fee being charged to the Fund was equal to the lowest  management fee
being charged to each of the Alternative  Investment Group's other multi-manager
funds,  and the Fund's  incentive  fee was below the median  incentive fee being
charged such multi-manager funds. In light of the foregoing,  the Directors felt
that the  combination  of management  fee and incentive fee being charged to the
Fund was appropriate.

         The Directors also  considered the  profitability  of UBSFA both before
payment to brokers and after payment to brokers and  concluded  that the profits
to be realized by UBSFA and its affiliates under the Fund's Investment  Advisory
Agreement and from other relationships  between the Fund and UBSFA were within a
range the Directors  considered  reasonable and appropriate.  The Directors also
discussed  the fact that the Fund was not large enough at that time to support a
request for breakpoints due to economies of scale. The Directors determined that
the  fees  were  reasonable.  The  Directors  concluded  that  approval  of  the
Investment  Advisory  Agreement  was in the best  interests  of the Fund and its
shareholders.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.

                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES


A. INTRODUCTION

         UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the "Adviser")  votes proxies for each fund
(each a "Fund," collectively,  the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and
as such, has adopted these Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies
and  Procedures").  The  Funds  are  funds of funds  that  invest  primarily  in
unregistered investment vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other
than the Fund. Generally,  each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets
in non-voting  securities of Investment Funds. The Investment Funds typically do
not submit matters to investors for vote; however,  should a matter be submitted
for vote and provided the Fund holds voting  interests in the  Investment  Fund,
the Adviser will vote proxies in what it views to be in the best interest of the
Fund  and in  accordance  with  these  Policies  and  Procedures.  THE  BOARD OF
DIRECTORS  (THE "BOARD") OF THE FUNDS HAS ADOPTED THESE  POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
AS THE FUNDS'. THE ADVISER WILL NOTIFY THE BOARD OF ANY CHANGES TO THE ADVISER'S
POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

         Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process.  The Adviser is under a fiduciary  duty to act in the best  interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize  shareholder  value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the  Adviser's  part to  analyze  the  issues  connected  with the  votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

         Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent  with  management's  recommendations  on  routine  matters,  absent a
particular  reason  to the  contrary.  Non-routine  matters  will be  voted on a
case-by-case  basis taking into  consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.

<PAGE>
D. CONFLICT OF INTEREST

         Any  circumstance  or relationship  which would  compromise a portfolio
manager's  objectivity  in voting  proxies in the best  interest  of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest.  In such  situations,  the Adviser will
address any material  conflicts  before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy,  the Adviser will presume the  existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

     >>  A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment Fund
         soliciting  proxies or has  communicated  its view to the Adviser on an
         impending proxy vote;

     >>  The portfolio  manager  responsible for  proxy-voting  has identified a
         personal  interest in the Investment Fund soliciting  proxies or in the
         outcome of a shareholder vote;

     >>  Members of the  portfolio  management  team,  including  the  portfolio
         manager   responsible  for  proxy-voting,   and/or  members  of  senior
         management,   have  a  personal  interest  through  investment  in  the
         Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

     >>  Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in the
         outcome of a shareholder  vote have  attempted to influence  either the
         Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.


                  Employees of the Adviser  should be aware of the potential for
conflicts  of  interest  that  may  result,  on the  part of the  Adviser,  from
employees'  personal  relationships or special  circumstances that may result as
part of the Adviser's  normal course of business.  Employees who become aware of
any such  conflicts  of  interest  are  under  obligation  to bring  them to the
attention  of  the  Chief  Compliance  Officer  or  Legal  who  will  work  with
appropriate  personnel  of the  Adviser  to  determine  the  materiality  of the
conflict.

                           ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. A conflict
of interest will be considered material to the extent it is determined that such
conflict has the  potential to influence the  Adviser's  decision-making  in the
proxy-voting process and the determination will be based on an assessment of the
particular facts and circumstances.

                  If it is  determined  that  a  conflict  of  interest  is  not
material,  the Adviser may vote  proxies  notwithstanding  the  existence of the
conflict.  The  Adviser  shall  maintain a written  record of all  conflicts  of
interest  identified,  the  materiality  determination,  and the method  used to
resolve the material conflict of interest.


If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate  personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution  before  voting  proxies  affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

     >>  Disclosing  the conflict and  obtaining  consent  before  voting (which
         consent  in the case of the  Fund(s)  may be  obtained  from the Fund's
         board of directors);

     >>  Engaging  another  party on behalf of the  Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
         its behalf;
<PAGE>

     >>  Engaging a third party to  recommend  a vote with  respect to the proxy
         based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

     >>  Such  other  method as is deemed  appropriate  under the  circumstances
         given the nature of the conflict.


E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD

         The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect
to the Fund(s)  during the preceding  twelve-month  period ended June 30 on Form
N-PX, no later than August 31st of the then year.


F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

         Where the Funds hold voting  rights,  the Funds shall  include in their
Form N-CSR (Certified  Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies
and  Procedures;  (ii) a statement  that a  description  of these  Policies  and
Procedures  is available  without  charge,  upon request by taking the specified
action;  and (iii) a statement that information  regarding how the Adviser voted
proxies  relating  to the Funds  during  the most  recent  12-month  period,  is
available upon request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription  document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting  rights,  the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

         The  Adviser  shall   maintain  the  following   records   relating  to
proxy-voting  in an  easily  accessible  place for a period of not less than six
years from the end of the fiscal  year  during  which the last entry was made on
such record, the first two years on-site:

     >>  A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;

     >>  A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);

     >>  A copy of each proxy  solicitation  (including  proxy  statements)  and
         related materials with regard to each vote;

     >>  A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution of
         conflicts of interest;
<PAGE>

     >>  A copy of any  document  created by the Adviser  that was material to a
         proxy  -voting  decision  or  that  memorialized  the  basis  for  that
         decision; and

     >>  A copy of each  written  investor  request for  information  on how the
         Adviser  voted  proxies  on  behalf of the  Fund(s),  and a copy of any
         written  response  from the Adviser to any  (written or oral)  investor
         request for  information  on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.


                         UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C.
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE


         The Fund is managed by a  portfolio  management  team,  each  member of
which (each, a "Portfolio  Manager" and together,  the "Portfolio  Managers") is
responsible  for the day-to-day  management of the Fund's  portfolio.  Norman E.
Sienko,  Jr., the lead member of the  portfolio  management  team,  is primarily
responsible  for  the  selection  of the  Fund's  investments,  and  is  jointly
responsible  for the  allocation  of the Fund's assets among  Investment  Funds.
Russell  Sinder  and Joseph M.  Sciortino,  the other  members of the  portfolio
management team, are jointly and primarily responsible for the allocation of the
Fund's investments.

         Mr.  Sienko has served as a  Portfolio  Manager of the Fund since April
1999, and as head of the Adviser's portfolio  management group since 1998. Prior
thereto,  Mr. Sienko served from 1996 to 1997 as Product Manager,  and from 1997
to 1998 as a Fund Manager in the UBS Financial Services  Alternative  Investment
Group. He is also currently an Executive Director of UBS Financial Services. Mr.
Sinder  has been  associated  with the Fund  since  April  1999 and  joined  the
portfolio  management  team in 2005.  Mr.  Sinder has been  associated  with the
Adviser  since  1998  and is also a  Director  of UBS  Financial  Services.  Mr.
Sciortino has been  associated  with the Fund since December 2006 and joined the
portfolio  management team at that time. Mr.  Sciortino has been associated with
the  Adviser  since  2006 and is also an  Associate  Director  of UBS  Financial
Services.  Previously,  he served as Senior Analyst at Lake Partners,  Inc. from
April 2001 though August 2006.

         The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including  registered  closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

         Potential  conflicts  of interest  may arise  because of the  Portfolio
Managers' management of the Fund and other accounts.  For example,  conflicts of
interest may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation
of limited  investment  opportunities.  Allocations of investment  opportunities
generally  could raise a  potential  conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio  Managers  may have an  incentive  to  allocate  investments  that are
expected to increase in value to  preferred  accounts.  Conversely,  a Portfolio
Manager  could favor one account  over  another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem  investments  are placed.  The Portfolio  Managers may be
perceived  to have a conflict of  interest if there are a large  number of other
accounts,  in  addition  to the Fund,  that they are  managing  on behalf of the
Adviser.  In  addition,  each  Portfolio  Manager  could be  viewed  as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more  Portfolio  Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio  Managers'  overall  responsibilities  to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.
<PAGE>

         Other  accounts may have  investment  objectives,  strategies and risks
that differ from those of the Fund.  For these or other  reasons,  the Portfolio
Managers may purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts,
and the  performance  of  investments  purchased  for the Fund may vary from the
performance  of the  investments  purchased  for other  accounts.  The Portfolio
Managers may place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or
indirectly contrary to investment  decisions made for the Fund, which could have
the potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

         A  potential  conflict  of  interest  may be  perceived  if the Adviser
receives a  performance-based  advisory  fee as to one account but not  another,
because a Portfolio  Manager may favor the  account  subject to the  performance
fee,  whether or not the  performance  of that account  directly  determines the
Portfolio Manager's compensation.

         The Adviser's  goal is to provide high quality  investment  services to
all of its clients,  while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients
fairly.  The  Adviser  has  adopted and  implemented  policies  and  procedures,
including  brokerage  and trade  allocation  policies  and  procedures,  that it
believes address the conflicts  associated with managing  multiple  accounts for
multiple  clients.  In  addition,  the  Adviser  monitors  a  variety  of areas,
including  compliance with Fund guidelines.  Furthermore,  senior investment and
business personnel at UBS Financial Services periodically review the performance
of the Portfolio Managers.

         The Portfolio Managers'  compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed
salary  and a  discretionary  bonus  paid  by  UBS  Financial  Services  or  its
affiliates and not by the Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid
in shares of stock or stock  options of UBS AG, the ultimate  parent  company of
the  Adviser,  subject to certain  vesting  periods.  The amount of a  Portfolio
Manager's  discretionary  bonus,  and the  portion to be paid in shares or stock
options of UBS AG, is determined by senior  officers of UBS Financial  Services.
In general,  the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination  of factors,
none of which is necessarily  weighted more than any other factor. These factors
may  include:  the  overall  performance  of  UBS  Financial  Services  and  its
Alternative   Investment   Group;  the  overall   performance  of  UBS  AG;  the
profitability to UBS Financial  Services derived from the management of the Fund
and the other accounts managed by the Alternative Investment Group; the absolute
performance  of the  Fund  and  such  other  accounts  for the  preceding  year;
contributions by the Portfolio  Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative
Investment  Group;  participation  by  the  Portfolio  Manager  in  training  of
personnel;  and support by the Portfolio  Manager  generally to colleagues.  The
bonus is not based on a precise formula, benchmark or other metric.

         The  following  table  lists the  number  and  types of other  accounts
advised by the Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management
in those accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.
