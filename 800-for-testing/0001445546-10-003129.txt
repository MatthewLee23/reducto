                  Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and/or Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four
Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor") and their respective representatives, taking into
account the information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements
include all statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact.
For example, forward-looking statements include the use of words such as
"anticipate," "estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may,"
"should," "would" or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or
outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the
information included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the
Advisor and/or Sub-Advisor and their respective representatives only as of the
date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these
forward-looking statements to reflect events and circumstances that arise after
the date hereof.

                        Performance and Risk Disclosure

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Notes to
Financial Statements for a discussion of certain other risks of investing in the
Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

                            How to Read This Report

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment. It
includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that provide
insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of relevant market
benchmarks.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of Four
Corners are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II

The primary investment objective of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating
Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues its objectives by investing in a portfolio of Senior Loans. There
can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved. The
Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.

Market Recap

After the S&P LSTA Leveraged Loan Index ("Index") posted its worst return in
history in 2008 (down 29.0%), the Index had a remarkable recovery and finished
2009 with the best return in Senior Loan market history (up 51.6%). The recovery
has extended into 2010, with Index returns up 3.8% through May, and up over
60.9% since the lows of December 2008. For the Fund's fiscal year ended May 31,
2010, Index returns were up 24.3%.

The rally in the Senior Loan market in 2009 was driven by strong technical
conditions rather than a strong fundamental environment. Despite record high
default rates, record low recovery rates, weak earnings and increased amendment
activity, demand for Senior Loans was broad-based, with investors seeking to
take advantage of the low prices/wide spreads at which Senior Loans were
trading. This strong demand combined with very little Senior Loan supply and
pushed the average reported Senior Loan price from 75.2% on June 1, 2009 to
87.3% on December 31, 2009.(1)


                                                                          Page 3

                 Portfolio Commentary - (Continued) (Unaudited)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical conditions have remained strong for most of 2010. High-yield bond
issuance has been very strong, and the proceeds from much of this issuance have
been used to repay Senior Loans. The reduction in outstanding Senior Loans from
these repayments has only been slightly offset by Senior Loan new issuance, and
the net result has been a 14% reduction in the amount of outstanding Senior
Loans from their peak on December 31, 2008 ($596 billion).(2) As of March 26,
2010, the amount of outstanding Senior Loans stood at $512.6 billion. In
addition to reduced supply, 2010 has also witnessed increased demand as retail
investors, searching for low duration alternatives, poured into the market with
$4.5 billion of new money into open-end Senior Loan mutual funds in the first
five months of the year.(3)

Along with continuing strong technical conditions, fundamental conditions have
been improving in 2010. The default rate, as measured by number of Senior Loan
issuers, has more than halved from its peak in November 2009 of 10.8% to 4.6% at
the end of May 2010.(4) Additionally, market-wide credit quality continues to
improve as new-issue Senior Loans are being structured more conservatively than
Senior Loans which were structured prior to the credit crisis. Further, earnings
are improving, with EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization) across public filers up 9.7% year-over-year in the first
quarter.(5)

Notwithstanding the continuing strong technical and improving fundamental
conditions in the Senior Loan market, we believe that broad-based macroeconomic
concerns weigh on global markets as fiscal imbalances come into focus,
unemployment remains stubbornly high, real estate remains weak and the European
sovereign debt crisis looms large in the minds of investors still reeling from
the U.S. credit crisis. Additionally, the correlation of the loan market with
broader risk markets has increased, and the Index return fell over 2.0% in May
2010 as concern surrounding the European debt crisis and the "flash crash" that
occurred in the U.S. equity markets spilled into the Senior Loan market.

Performance Analysis

For the Fund's fiscal year ended May 31, 2010, FCT generated a market total
return(6) of 30.8% (including market price change and dividends) and net asset
value ("NAV") total return(7) of 23.0%. After two dividend cuts early in its
fiscal year, FCT has declared three dividend increases during calendar 2010
beginning with the distribution payable in June 2010. The Fund's closing price
on May 28, 2010 was $12.65, which represented an 9.4% discount to its NAV,
compared to the Fund's discount to NAV 12 months earlier on May 29, 2009 of
14.8%.

Distributions totaled $0.425 per Common Share during the twelve months ended May
31, 2010, which represented a 45.5% decrease from the prior twelve months ended
May 31, 2009. Based on the Fund's current dividend, FCT's distribution rate is
3.56% (calculated on the Fund's share price) and 3.22% (based on the Fund's NAV)
as of May 31, 2010. For the Fund's fiscal year ended May 31, 2010 dividends
produced a Fund yield (based on price) of 3.36%. The Fund's yield declined
earlier in its fiscal year as lower LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)
reduced the Fund's income. Likewise, the Fund's yield increased later in its
fiscal year as higher asset spreads flowed through the portfolio. The Fund's
yield was lower than the "pure-play" peer group average price yield of 4.71% and
lower than the broad peer group average price yield of 5.90%(8) for the Fund's
fiscal year ended May 31, 2010.

The Fund's NAV return for its fiscal year ended May 31, 2010 underperformed the
Index and its peer group. The Fund underperformed the Index by 1.25% and also
underperformed the "pure-play" peer group average by 6.7% and the broad peer
group average by 13.7% for the same period. The Fund's performance includes the
negative impact of fees, expenses, and un-invested cash balances which are not
part of the Index return.

There are a number of reasons for the Fund's lower yield and lower NAV returns.
Recent relative underperformance has been largely attributable to continued risk
asset outperformance. The Fund's assets have higher average credit quality than
most funds in the "pure-play" peer group, and lower quality assets outperformed
higher quality assets during the year.

Additionally, many of the Fund's peers have higher levels of leverage, which
helped to improve their relative performance in an improving market. We have
deliberately reduced the Fund's level of leverage. While Senior Loan funds had
historically been structured with target leverage, including preferred stock, of
close to 40%, that was also in an environment where Senior Loan prices were more
stable than they have been in recent years. While we understand that lower
leverage can result in underperformance and lower yields during rising markets,
we believe that, given the higher correlation to global markets and higher
volatility in the Senior Loan market, it is now prudent to maintain lower levels
of leverage than existed prior to the recent credit crisis. During the period,
the Fund purchased or redeemed all of its outstanding Auction Market Preferred
Shares. The Fund's leverage is now entirely in the form of debt, which also
limits the amount of leverage that the Fund can utilize.

We are very pleased with the market rally and the Fund's performance during the
last 12 months. Our investment strategy remains unchanged, namely to invest in
the higher credit quality portion of the non-investment grade Senior Loan
market. We continue to believe that this strategy over the long term will result
in higher risk-adjusted returns for investors as they are expected to see less

NAV erosion and less volatility than higher risk, yield-focused strategies.
While our peers may sacrifice credit quality in favor of current yield, we do
not believe that a marginal increase in current yield is worth the increased
principal risk by lowering the credit quality of the Fund's portfolio.

As mentioned above, we are pleased to highlight that FCT recently announced
three dividend increases, and we believe that the recent reduction in leverage
costs will assist in increasing the Fund's income.

Market and Fund Outlook

Although both technical and fundamental conditions are much improved, we remain
cautious about the outlook for the market and the overall economy. Unemployment
and housing remain weak, creating headwinds for a sustained, consumer-driven
recovery. Sovereign credit risk, especially with respect to Greece and the other
so-called PIIGS nations (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain), has
created nervousness in the market that has led some participants, especially
banks, to reduce their credit exposure. Furthermore, concerns surrounding
sovereign debt contagion have not only pushed the equity, Senior Loan and high
yield markets lower, but also raised the specter of a possible double-dip in the
economy.

However, notwithstanding our cautious fundamental outlook and the market's
dramatic recovery, we believe that the Senior Loan market still offers good
value at current levels compared to historical levels. Additionally, the Senior
Loan asset class continues to benefit from very low duration. While this has
obviously resulted in lower yields as rates have declined, we believe it appeals
to investors who are looking for credit spread with little duration risk.
Consequently, while we remain very cautious about fundamental economic
conditions and absolute leverage levels, we continue to believe that there will
be ongoing demand for well structured Senior Loans, which should add to relative
stability for the asset class compared to 2008's volatility.

It is our view that the Fund offers a high quality, non-investment grade
portfolio focused almost exclusively on first-lien Senior Loans. As a result, we
expect the Fund's relative performance to be driven by relative returns among
risk asset categories. Further, we believe that, given the global macro-economic
risks we face as well as the increased volatility that we have experienced in
the Senior Loan market, FCT is positioned appropriately to maximize
risk-adjusted returns.

8   The "pure-play" peer group consists of a smaller subset (FCM, FCT,
    PPR, TLI and VVR) of the broad peer group, which invests almost
    exclusively in Senior Loans. We believe that these "pure-play"
    funds are generally more comparable to the Fund than the broad
    peer group, as the non-Senior Loan holdings are routinely less
    than 5% of such funds. Of the broad peer group, eleven of the 16
    total funds invest a material portion of their assets in
    high-yield bonds, emerging markets debt or other types of
    corporate debt securities.

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                                  May 31, 2010

                              1. Fund Description

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing in a portfolio of senior secured
floating-rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no assurance that
the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in Senior Loans
involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining credit quality,
it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its secondary
investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.


                       2. Significant Accounting Policies

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. Portfolio Valuation:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. Domestic debt securities and foreign
securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal
markets for those securities. The NAV per Common Share is calculated by dividing
the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued interest), less all
liabilities (including accrued expenses, dividends declared but unpaid and any
borrowings of the Fund) and the liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred
Shares, by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio investments, at fair value according
to valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of
the Fund's assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties.
In the event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing
service does not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations
are deemed unreliable, the Fund's Board of Trustees has designated First Trust
Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") to use a fair value method to value the Fund's
investments. Additionally, if events occur after the close of the principal
market for particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities),
but before the Fund values its assets, that could materially affect NAV, First
Trust may use a fair value method to value the Fund's investments. The use of
fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by valuation procedures adopted by
the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940
Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially since its inception, generally has fewer trades and less liquidity
than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior Loans have
few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a specific
Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete. Accordingly,
determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on infrequent
and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data available,
elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans than
for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued using
information provided by a third party pricing service. If the pricing service
cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior Loan or such
valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior Loan at a fair
value according to valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio investments listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
investments are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Portfolio investments traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ
Official Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio investments traded on
more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the
business day as of which such value is being determined at the close of the
exchange representing the principal market for such investments. Portfolio
investments traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding investments
traded on the NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term
investments that mature in less than 60 days when purchased are valued at
amortized cost.

The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

- -    Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical
     securities. An active market is a market in which transactions for the
     security occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing
     information on an ongoing basis.
- -    Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
     indirectly, and include the following:

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                                  May 31, 2010

     o  Quoted prices for similar securities in active markets.
     o  Quoted prices for identical or similar securities in markets that are
        non-active. A non-active market is a market where there are few
        transactions for the security, the prices are not current, or price
        quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers,
        or in which little information is released publicly.
     o  Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the security
        (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly
        quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities,
        credit risks, and default rates).
     o  Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable
         market data by correlation or other means.
- -    Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs
     reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions that
     market participants would use in pricing the security.

The inputs or methodology used for valuing portfolio investments are not
necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those
investments. A summary of the inputs used to value the Fund's portfolio
investments as of May 31, 2010 is included with the Fund's Portfolio of
Investments.

B. Repurchase Agreements:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period.

This arrangement results in a fixed rate of return that is not subject to market
fluctuations during the Fund's holding period. The value of the collateral is at
all times at least equal to the total amount of the repurchase obligation,
including interest. In the event of counterparty default, the Fund has the right
to use the collateral to offset losses incurred. There is potential loss to the
Fund in the event the Fund is delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to
dispose of the collateral investments, including the risk of a possible decline
in the value of the underlying investments during the period while the Fund
seeks to assert its rights. The Advisor reviews the value of the collateral and
the creditworthiness of those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into
repurchase agreements to evaluate potential risks. As of May 31, 2010, the Fund
had no open repurchase agreements.

C. Investment Transactions and Investment Income:

Investment transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from investment transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Investments purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date. Due to the nature of the Senior
Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be certain at the time of the
purchase or sale for some of the investments. Interest income on such
investments is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund maintains liquid
assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of its when-issued or
delayed-delivery purchase commitments.

D. Unfunded Loan Commitments:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund did not have unfunded delayed draw loan
commitments as of May 31, 2010.

E. Restricted Investments:

The Fund invests in restricted investments, which are investments that cannot be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended. Prior to registration, restricted investments may only be
resold in transactions exempt from registration. The Fund held restricted
investments at May 31, 2010 as shown in the following table. The Fund does not
have the right to demand that such investments be registered. These investments
are valued according to the valuation procedures as stated in the Portfolio
Valuation footnote (Note 2A) and are not expressed as a discount to the carrying
value of a comparable unrestricted investment. There are no unrestricted
investments with the same maturity dates and yields for these issuers.

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                                  May 31, 2010

F. Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and any Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund, if AMP Shares are issued and outstanding at the time, in
proportion to the total dividends paid for the year. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investments held by the
Fund, timing differences and differing characterizations of distributions made
by the Fund. Permanent differences incurred during the tax year ended May 31,
2010, resulting in book and tax differences, have been reclassified at year end
to reflect a decrease in accumulated net investment income (loss) of $764,780,
an increase in accumulated net realized gain (loss) on investments of $988,327
and a decrease in paid-in capital of $223,547. Net assets applicable to Common
Shareholders were not affected by this reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2010 and 2009 is as follows:

Distributions paid from:                    2010                    2009
Ordinary Income                    $     11,164,283     $     21,941,351

As of May 31, 2010, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income                    $        210,967
Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)            (20,822,124)
Accumulated Capital and other losses                 (106,617,974)

G. Income Taxes:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal or state income taxes.

The Fund intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws, which
allow it to carry realized capital losses forward for eight years following the
year of loss and offset such loss against any future realized capital gains. The
Fund is subject to certain limitations under U.S. tax rules on the use of
capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These limitations
apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership. At May 31, 2010, the Fund
had a capital loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of $100,873,038
with $3,984,460, $3,611,723, $25,585,953 and $67,690,902 expiring on May 31,
2014, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

Certain losses realized after October 31 may be deferred and treated as
occurring on the first day of the following fiscal year. For the fiscal year
ended May 31, 2010, the Fund intends to elect to defer net realized losses
incurred between November 1, 2009 and May 31, 2010 of $5,744,936.

The Fund is subject to tax accounting standards that establish a minimum
threshold for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ending
2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 remain open to federal and state audit. As of May 31,
2010, management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund,
and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's
financial statements for uncertain tax positions.

H. Expenses:

The Fund pays all expenses directly related to its operations.

I. Accounting Pronouncement:

In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2010-06 "Improving Disclosures about
Fair Value Measurements." ASU 2010-06 amends FASB Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to require
additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Certain disclosures
required by ASU No. 2010-06 are effective for interim and annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2009, and other required disclosures are
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010, and for interim
periods within those fiscal years. Management is currently evaluating the impact
ASU No. 2010-06 will have on the Fund's financial statement disclosures.


 3. Investment Advisory Fee, Affiliated Transactions and Other Fee Arrangements

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage. L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's

                                  May 31, 2010

investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, which are the average daily gross asset
value of the Fund (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP Shares,
if AMP Shares are outstanding at the time, and the principal amount of
borrowings), minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid dividends on any
outstanding AMP Shares, if AMP Shares are outstanding at the time, and
liabilities.

Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor")
serves as the Fund's investment sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

In accordance with certain fee arrangements, PNC Global Investment Servicing
(U.S.) Inc., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services
Group, Inc. ("PNC"), serves as the Fund's Administrator, Fund Accountant and
Transfer Agent. PFPC Trust Company, also an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary
of PNC, serves as the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee
arrangements.

On July 1, 2010, all of the stock of PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc., an
indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of PNC, was sold to The Bank of New York
Mellon Corporation (BNY Mellon) ("Stock Sale"). The Stock Sale included PNC
Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. and PFPC Trust Company. Effective July
1, 2010, PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.) Inc. changed its name to BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. PFPC Trust Company will not change its
name until a later date to be announced.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG, served as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar, dividend
disbursing agent and redemption agent prior to the Fund's AMP Share tender offer
and redemption transactions (see Note 5 below).

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid an annual retainer
of $10,000 per trust for the first 14 trusts of the First Trust Fund Complex and
an annual retainer of $7,500 per trust for each subsequent trust in the First
Trust Fund Complex. The annual retainer is allocated equally among each of the
trusts. No additional meeting fees are paid in connection with Board or
Committee meetings.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee is paid $10,000 annually, the
Chairman of the Audit Committee is paid $5,000 annually and each of the Chairmen
of the Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee is paid
$2,500 annually to serve in such capacities, with such compensation paid by the
trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex and divided among those trusts. Trustees
are also reimbursed by the trusts in the First Trust Fund Complex for travel and
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with all meetings. The Lead Independent
Trustee and each Committee chairman will serve two-year terms ending on December
31, 2011, before rotating to serve as a chairman of another committee or as Lead
Independent Trustee. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive no
compensation from the trusts for serving in such capacities.


                     4. Purchases and Sales of Investments

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments, excluding short-term
investments, for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2010 were $287,562,387 and
$242,452,417, respectively.


                       5. Auction Market Preferred Shares

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As described below, as of May 31,
2010, the Fund did not have any preferred shares outstanding.

On August 28, 2009, the Fund commenced a tender offer for up to 100% of its
outstanding Series A and Series B AMP Shares at a purchase price equal to 97% of
the liquidation preference of $25,000 per AMP Share, plus any unpaid dividends
accrued through the expiration date of the offer. On September 14, 2009, the
Fund increased the purchase price to 100% of the liquidation preference per AMP
Share ($25,000 per AMP Share), plus any unpaid dividends accrued through the
expiration date of the offer. As of the expiration of the tender offer at 5:00
p.m., Eastern time, on September 28, 2009, 1,509 of the 1,600 outstanding Series
A AMP Shares and 1,549 of the 1,600 outstanding Series B AMP Shares were validly
tendered in the offer. The Fund paid the purchase price for such validly
tendered AMP Shares by depositing the purchase price with the depositary for the
offer, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas.

On October 12, 2009, First Trust announced the Fund's intention to redeem its
remaining outstanding AMP Shares in the principal amount of $2,275,000 Series A
AMP Shares and $1,275,000 Series B AMP Shares. The Fund completed such
redemption of the Series A and Series B AMP Shares on November 18, 2009.
Following completion of such redemption, the Fund no longer has any preferred
shares outstanding.


                                                                         Page 25

</TABLE>


                                 6. Borrowings

The Fund has entered into a Revolving Credit Facility ("Credit Facility") with
various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as agent, to be used as
leverage for the Fund. The Credit Facility has an expiration date of May 11,
2011 and may be renewed annually. The Credit Facility provides for a secured
line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets are pledged against advances made
to the Fund. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after
any such borrowings, must have an "asset coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of
the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit
Facility was $150,000,000. Effective May 13, 2010, the total commitment under
the Credit Facility was increased to $160,000,000. For the fiscal year ended May
31, 2010, the average amount outstanding was $98,091,096. The loans under the
Credit Facility funded by CRC Funding, LLC (the "Conduit Lender") bear interest
for each settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper
rate of the Conduit Lender. The loans under the Credit Facility funded by
Citibank, N.A. (the "Secondary Lender") bear interest for each settlement period
at a per annum rate equal to (i) the Eurodollar rate for the settlement period
plus 7.50% or (ii) the alternate base rate plus 5.00%. For the fiscal year ended
May 31, 2010, the Fund had no loans under the Credit Facility funded by the
Secondary Lender. The high and low annual interest rates for the loans under the
Credit Facility funded by the Conduit Lender during the fiscal year ended May
31, 2010, were 0.83% and 0.23%, respectively, with a weighted average interest
rate of 0.30%. The annual interest rate in effect for such loans at May 31, 2010
was 0.27%. The Fund also pays additional borrowing costs, which included a
program fee of 1.25% and a liquidity fee of 0.50% per year. Effective May 13,
2010, program and liquidity fees were revised to new per annum rates of 0.50%
and 0.35%, respectively. On May 15, 2009, in connection with the annual
extension of the expiration date of the Credit Facility, the Fund paid upfront
closing fees of $1,125,000. On May 13, 2010, the Fund extended the expiration
date of the Credit Facility for another year and paid upfront closing fees of
$400,000. Such fees are amortized over one-year periods and are included with
the other borrowing costs in "Interest and fees on loan" on the Statement of
Operations.

                             7. Risk Considerations

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some of the risks
that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information about the
risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's prospectus
and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund regulatory
filings.

Investment and Market Risk: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the investments owned by the Fund. The value of these investments, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Investment prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the bond market, or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines that it
is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that it is
impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred and
trading in the investments is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

High-Yield Securities Risk: The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree.

High-yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of
loss than securities with higher investment ratings. A reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an
issuer on the interest and principal payments. The market for high-yield
securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities.

Leverage Risk: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                                  May 31, 2010

borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

Senior Loan Risk: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be
secured by specific collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
Fund's investment when the Senior Loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the Senior Loan subsequent to the Fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the Fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the Senior Loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a Senior Loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the Fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.


                               8. Indemnification

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.


                              9. Subsequent Events

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that besides
these subsequent events that have already been disclosed there were the
following subsequent events:

On May 20, 2010, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.039 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on June 3, 2010, payable June 15, 2010.

On June 21, 2010, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.050 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on July 6, 2010, payable July 15, 2010.

On July 20, 2010, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.055 per share to Common
Shareholders of record on August 4, 2010, payable August 16, 2010.


                                                                         Page 27

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Trustees and Shareholders of First Trust/Four Corners Senior
Floating Rate Income Fund II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of May 31, 2010, and the related statements of
operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of investments owned as of May 31, 2010, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, agent banks, and brokers; where replies were not received, we
performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II as of May 31, 2010, the
results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, the
changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended,
and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

                           Dividend Reinvestment Plan

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (formerly PNC Global Investment Servicing
(U.S.) Inc.) (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common Shares under the Plan. If
you elect to receive cash distributions, you will receive all distributions in
cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the Plan Agent, as the dividend
paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

     (1)  If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
          the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
          equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or (ii)
          95% of the market price on that date.

     (2)  If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
          Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will
          purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE Amex (formerly
          known as the NYSE Alternext US and the AMEX) or elsewhere, for the
          participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price for the
          Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its
          purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by
          the Plan Agent may exceed the market price at the time of valuation,
          resulting in the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or
          distribution had been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The
          Plan Agent will use all dividends and distributions received in cash
          to purchase Common Shares in the open market within 30 days of the
          valuation date except where temporary curtailment or suspension of
          purchases is necessary to comply with federal securities laws.
          Interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (800) 331-1710, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

               Investment Management and Sub-Advisory Agreements

Board Considerations Regarding Continuation of Investment Management and
Sub-Advisory Agreememts

The Board of Trustees of First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II (the "Fund"), including the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved
the continuation of the Investment Management Agreement (the "Advisory
Agreement") between the Fund and First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor") and
the Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (the "Sub-Advisory Agreement" and together
with the Advisory Agreement, the "Agreements") among the Fund, the Advisor and
Four Corners Capital Management, LLC (the "Sub-Advisor"), at a meeting held on
March 21-22, 2010. The Board determined that the terms of the Agreements are
fair and reasonable and that the Agreements continue to be in the best interests
of the Fund.

To reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as well as under
the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving advisory
contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the fiduciary duty
of investment advisors with respect to advisory agreements and compensation; the
standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have
fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by the Board in voting
on such agreements. To assist the Board in its evaluation of the Agreements, the
Independent Trustees received a separate report from each of the Advisor and the
Sub-Advisor in advance of the Board meeting responding to a request for
information from counsel to the Independent Trustees. The reports, among other
things, outlined the services provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor
(including the relevant personnel responsible for these services and their
experience); the advisory and sub-advisory fees for the Fund as compared to fees
charged to other clients of the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor and as compared to
fees charged by investment advisors and sub-advisors to comparable funds;
expenses of the Fund as compared to expense ratios of comparable funds; the
nature of expenses incurred in providing services to the Fund and the potential
for economies of scale, if any; financial data on the Advisor and the
Sub-Advisor; any fall out benefits to the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor; and
information on the Advisor's and the Sub-Advisor's compliance programs. The
Independent Trustees also met separately with their independent legal counsel to
discuss the information provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor. The Board
applied its business judgment to determine whether the arrangements between the
Fund and the Advisor and among the Fund, the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor are
reasonable business arrangements from the Fund's perspective as well as from the
perspective of shareholders.

In reviewing the Agreements, the Board considered the nature, quality and extent
of services provided by the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor under the Agreements.
The Board considered the Advisor's statements regarding the incremental benefits
associated with the Fund's advisor/sub-advisor management structure. With
respect to the Advisory Agreement, the Board considered that the Advisor is
responsible for the overall management and administration of the Fund, including
the oversight of the Sub-Advisor. The Board noted the efforts made by the
Advisor with respect to a tender offer for the Fund's outstanding auction market
preferred shares. The Board noted the compliance program that had been developed
by the Advisor and considered that the compliance program includes policies and
procedures for monitoring the Sub-Advisor's compliance with the 1940 Act and the
Fund's investment objectives and policies. The Board also noted the enhancements
made by the Advisor to the compliance program in 2009. With respect to the
Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Board received a presentation from representatives
of the Sub-Advisor discussing the services that the Sub-Advisor provides to the
Fund and how the Sub-Advisor manages the Fund's investments. In light of the
information presented and the considerations made, the Board concluded that the
nature, quality and extent of services provided to the Fund by the Advisor and
the Sub-Advisor under the Agreements have been and are expected to remain
satisfactory and that the Sub-Advisor, under the oversight of the Advisor, has
managed the Fund consistent with its investment objectives and policies.

          First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II
                            May 31, 2010 (Unaudited)


The Board considered the advisory and sub-advisory fees paid under the
Agreements. The Board considered the advisory fees charged by the Advisor to
similar funds and other non-fund clients, and noted that the Advisor does not
provide advisory services to clients with investment objectives and policies
similar to the Fund's other than to two other closed end funds to which
different advisory fee rates are charged. The Board also considered information
provided by the Sub-Advisor as to the fees it charges to other similar clients,
noting that the Sub-Advisor sub-advises the same two other closed-end funds with
similar investment objectives and policies, to which different sub-advisory fee
rates are charged. In addition, the Board received data prepared by Lipper Inc.
("Lipper"), an independent source, showing the management fees and expense
ratios of the Fund as compared to the management fees and expense ratios of a
combined peer group selected by Lipper and the Advisor. The Board discussed with
representatives of the Advisor the limitations in creating a relevant peer group
for the Fund, including that (i) the peer funds may use different types of
leverage which have different costs associated with them; (ii) most peer funds
do not employ an advisor/sub-advisor management structure; (iii) the peer funds
may not have the same fiscal year as the Fund, which may cause the expense data
used by Lipper to be measured over different time periods; and (iv) many of the
peer funds are larger than the Fund. The Board reviewed the Lipper materials,
but based on its discussions with the Advisor, the Board determined that the
Lipper data was of limited value for purposes of its consideration of the
renewal of the Agreements.

The Board also considered performance information for the Fund, noting that the
performance information included the Fund's quarterly performance report, which
is part of the process that the Board has established for monitoring the Fund's
performance on an ongoing basis, and had been enhanced to assess portfolio risk
as well. The Board determined that this process continues to be effective for
reviewing the Fund's performance. In addition to the Board's ongoing review of
performance, the Board also received data prepared by Lipper comparing the
Fund's performance to the combined peer group selected by Lipper and the
Advisor, as well as to a larger group and to a benchmark. The Board reviewed the
Lipper materials, but for similar reasons to those described above, the Board
determined that the performance data provided by Lipper was of limited value.
The Board considered changes made to the Fund's leverage arrangements in 2009 as
a result of market events and considered an analysis prepared by the Advisor on
the continued benefits provided by the Fund's leverage. In addition, the Board
considered the market price and net asset value performance of the Fund since
inception, and compared the Fund's premium/discount to the average and median
premium/discount of the combined peer group, noting that the Fund's
premium/discount was generally indicative of the asset class and market events.
Based on the information provided and the Board's ongoing review of the Fund's
performance, the Board concluded that the Fund's performance, particularly over
the long term, was reasonable.

On the basis of all the information provided on the fees, expenses and
performance of the Fund, the Board concluded that the advisory and sub-advisory
fees were reasonable and appropriate in light of the nature, quality and extent
of services provided by the Advisor and Sub-Advisor under the Agreements.

The Board noted that the Advisor has continued to invest in personnel and
infrastructure and considered whether fee levels reflect any economies of scale
for the benefit of shareholders. The Board concluded that the advisory fee
reflects an appropriate level of sharing of any economies of scale at current
asset levels. The Board also considered the costs of the services provided and
profits realized by the Advisor from serving as investment manager to the Fund
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, as set forth in the materials
provided to the Board. The Board noted the inherent limitations in the
profitability analysis, and concluded that the Advisor's profitability appeared
to be not excessive in light of the services provided to the Fund. In addition,
the Board considered and discussed any ancillary benefits derived by the Advisor
from its relationship with the Fund and noted that the typical fall out benefits
to the Advisor such as soft dollars are not present. The Board concluded that
any other fall out benefits received by the Advisor or its affiliates would
appear to be limited.

The Board considered that the Sub-Advisor's investment services expenses are
primarily fixed, and that the Sub-Advisor had previously invested in personnel
and systems and anticipated continued maintenance of efficient personnel and
systems in support of the Fund. The Board considered that the sub-advisory fee
rate was negotiated at arm's length between the Advisor and the Sub-Advisor, an
unaffiliated third party. The Board also considered data provided by the
Sub-Advisor as to the profitability of the Sub-Advisory Agreement to the
Sub-Advisor, noting that the method used to allocate expenses was not a typical
practice of the Sub-Advisor. The Board noted the inherent limitations in this
profitability analysis and concluded that the profitability analysis for the
Advisor was more relevant, although the profitability of the Sub-Advisory
Agreement appeared to be not excessive in light of the services provided to the
Fund. The Board noted that the Sub-Advisor does not maintain any soft-dollar
arrangements and that the Sub-Advisor indicated that it does not receive any
material fall out benefits from its relationship to the Fund.

Based on all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, determined that the terms of the
Agreements continue to be fair and reasonable and that the continuation of the
Agreements is in the best interests of the Fund. No single factor was
determinative in the Board's analysis.

with or overseen by another investment adviser) and any entity controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser that provides
ongoing services to the Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to its
policies, the Committee will consider whether the provision of such non-audit
services is compatible with the auditor's independence.


          (e)(2) The percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
through (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser of this
Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant to the pre-approval
exceptions included in paragraph (c)(7)(i)(c) or paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

          (b)  0%

          (c)  0%

          (d)  0%

          (f) The percentage of hours expended on the principal accountant's
engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements for the most recent
fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by persons other than the
principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees was less than fifty
percent.

          (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrant's
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the Registrant for 2009 were
$5,200 and $6,000 for the Registrant and the Registrant's investment adviser,
respectively, and for 2010 were $5,200 and $36,000 for the Registrant and the
Registrant's investment adviser, respectively.

          (h) The Registrant's audit committee of its Board of Trustees
determined that the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the
Registrant's investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
Registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule
2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.



ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

     (a) The registrant has a separately designated standing audit committee
         consisting of all the independent trustees of the registrant. The
         members of the audit committee are: Thomas R. Kadlec, Niel B. Nielson,
         Richard E. Erickson and Robert F. Keith.



ITEM 6. INVESTMENTS.

(a)   Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the
      close of the reporting period is included as part of the report to
      shareholders filed under Item 1 of this form.

(b)   Not applicable.



ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are attached herewith.


                           FIRST TRUST ADVISORS L.P.
                            PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

         First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Adviser") serves as investment adviser
providing discretionary investment advisory services for separate managed
accounts, ERISA accounts and open- and closed-end investment companies (the
"Clients"). As part of these services, the Adviser may have responsibility for
proxy voting and related duties. In fulfilling these duties, the Adviser has
adopted the following policies and procedures:

         1. It is the Adviser's policy to seek and to ensure that proxies are
voted on securities in a Client's account consistently and solely in the best
economic interests of the Client.

         2. The Adviser shall be responsible for the oversight of Client proxy
voting processes and shall assign a senior member of its staff to be responsible
for this oversight.

         3. The Adviser has engaged the services of Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. ("ISS") to make recommendations to the Adviser on the voting of
proxies related to securities held by Clients. ISS provides voting
recommendations based on established guidelines and practices. The Adviser has
adopted these ISS Proxy Voting Guidelines.

         4. The Adviser shall review the ISS recommendations and generally will
vote proxies in accordance with such recommendations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Adviser may not vote in accordance with the ISS recommendations
if the Adviser believes that the specific ISS recommendation is not in the best
interests of the Client. In addition, whenever a conflict of interest arises
between ISS and a company subject to a proxy vote, the Adviser will vote the
proxy without using the analyses of ISS and will consider the recommendation of
the company and what the Adviser believes to be in the best interests of the
Client. In addition, if the Adviser has actual knowledge of any other type of
material conflict of interest between itself and the respective Client with
respect to the voting of a proxy, the Adviser shall vote the applicable proxy in
accordance with the ISS recommendations to avoid such conflict of interest. With
respect to open- and closed-end funds and variable annuity sub-accounts, if
there is a conflict of interest between fund shareholders and FTA, the fund's
principal underwriter, or sub-adviser, if applicable, FTA will vote the proxy
based on the recommendations of ISS to avoid such conflict of interest.

         5. If the Adviser manages the assets or pension fund of a company and
any of the Adviser's Clients hold any securities in that company, the Adviser
will vote proxies relating to such company's securities in accordance with the
ISS recommendations to avoid any conflict of interest.

              6. If a Client requests the Adviser to follow specific voting
     guidelines or additional guidelines, the Adviser shall review the request
     and follow such guidelines, unless the Adviser determines that it is unable
     to follow such guidelines. In such case, the Adviser shall inform the
     Client that it is not able to follow the Client's request.

         7. FTA will monitor changes to the ISS guidelines to determine that
such guidelines continue to result in a voting policy that is in the best
interests of Clients.

         8. In certain circumstances, where FTA has determined that it is
consistent with the Client's best interest, FTA will not take steps to ensure
that proxies are voted on securities in the Client's accounts. The following are
circumstances where this may occur:

         (a) Limited Value. Proxies will not be required to be voted on
securities in a Client's account if the value of the Client's economic interest
in the securities is indeterminable or insignificant (less than $1,000). Proxies
will also not be required to be voted for any securities that are no longer held
by the Client's account.

         (b) Securities Lending Program. When securities are out on loan, they
are transferred into the borrower's name and are voted by the borrower, in its
discretion. In most cases, FTA will not take steps to see that loaned securities
are voted. However, where FTA determines that a proxy vote, or other shareholder
action, is materially important to the Client's account, FTA will make a good
faith effort to recall the security for purposes of voting, understanding that
in certain cases, the attempt to recall the security may not be effective in
time for voting deadlines to be met.

         (c) Unjustifiable Costs. In certain circumstances, after doing a
cost-benefit analysis, FTA may choose not to vote where the cost of voting a
Client's proxy would exceed any anticipated benefits to the Client of the proxy
proposal (e.g. foreign securities).

         9. For certain open- or closed-end funds relying on Section 12(d)(1)(F)
of the 1940 Act, FTA will vote on proxies of securities of investment companies
held by such funds in the same proportion as all other holders of such
securities (i.e. mirror or echo voting) to the extent possible.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Routine/Miscellaneous:

Auditor Ratification

Vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the following apply:

   o  An auditor has a financial interest in or association with the company,
      and is therefore not independent;

   o  There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered an
      opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
      financial position;

   o  Poor accounting practices are identified that rise to a serious level
      of concern, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; and material
      weaknesses identified in Section 404 disclosures; or

   o  Fees for non-audit services ("Other" fees) are excessive.

Non-audit fees are excessive if:

   o  Non-audit ("other") fees exceed audit fees + audit-related fees + tax
      compliance/preparation fees


                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]


Board of Directors:

Votes on director nominees should be determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.
Four fundamental principles apply when determining votes on director nominees:

   o   Board Accountability

   o   Board Responsiveness

   o   Director Independence

   o   Director Competence



<PAGE>


Board Accountability

Problematic Takeover Defenses

VOTE WITHHOLD/AGAINST(1) the entire board of directors (except new nominees(2),
who should be considered on a CASE-by-CASE basis), if:

   o   The board is classified, and a continuing director responsible for a
       problematic governance issue at the board/committee level that would
       warrant a withhold/against vote recommendation is not up for election --
       any or all appropriate nominees (except new) may be held accountable;

   o   The company's poison pill has a "dead-hand" or "modified dead-hand"
       feature. Vote withhold/against every year until this feature is removed;

   o   The board adopts a poison pill with a term of more than 12 months
       ("long-term pill"), or renews any existing pill, including any
       "short-term" pill (12 months or less), without shareholder approval. A
       commitment or policy that puts a newly-adopted pill to a binding
       shareholder vote may potentially offset an adverse vote recommendation.
       Review such companies with classified boards every year, and such
       companies with annually-elected boards at least once every three years,
       and vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD votes from all nominees if the company still
       maintains a non-shareholder-approved poison pill. This policy applies to
       all companies adopting or renewing pills after the announcement of this
       policy (Nov 19, 2009);

   o   The board makes a material adverse change to an existing poison pill
       without shareholder approval.


Vote CASE-By-CASE on all nominees if the board adopts a poison pill with a term
of 12 months or less ("short-term pill") without shareholder approval, taking
into account the following factors:

   o   The date of the pill`s adoption relative to the date of the next meeting
       of shareholders- i.e. whether the company had time to put the pill on
       ballot for shareholder ratification given the circumstances;

   o   The issuer`s rationale;

   o   The issuer's governance structure and practices; and

   o   The issuer's track record of accountability to shareholders.


(1)      In general, companies with a plurality vote standard use "Withhold" as
         the valid contrary vote option in director elections; companies with a
         majority vote standard use "Against". However, it will vary by company
         and the proxy must be checked to determine the valid contrary vote
         option for the particular company.


(2)      A "new nominee" is any current nominee who has not already been elected
         by shareholders and who joined the board after the problematic action
         in question transpired. If RMG cannot determine whether the nominee
         joined the board before or after the problematic action transpired, the
         nominee will be considered a "new nominee" if he or she joined the
         board within the 12 months prior to the upcoming shareholder meeting.


<PAGE>


Problematic Audit-Related Practices

Generally, vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from the members of the Audit Committee if:

   o   The non-audit fees paid to the auditor are excessive (see discussion
       under "Auditor Ratification");

   o   The company receives an adverse opinion on the company's financial
       statements from its auditor; or

   o   There is persuasive evidence that the audit committee entered into an
       inappropriate indemnification agreement with its auditor that limits the
       ability of the company, or its shareholders, to pursue legitimate legal
       recourse against the audit firm.

Vote CASE-by-CASE on members of the Audit Committee and/or the full board if:

   o   Poor accounting practices are identified that rise to a level of serious
       concern, such as: fraud; misapplication of GAAP; and material weaknesses
       identified in Section 404 disclosures. Examine the severity, breadth,
       chronological sequence and duration, as well as the company's efforts at
       remediation or corrective actions, in determining whether
       WITHHOLD/AGAINST votes are warranted.


Problematic Compensation Practices

VOTE WITHHOLD/AGAINST the members of the Compensation Committee and potentially
the full board if:

   o   There is a negative correlation between chief executive pay and company
       performance (see Pay for Performance Policy);

   o   The company reprices underwater options for stock, cash, or other
       consideration without prior shareholder approval, even if allowed in the
       firm's equity plan;

   o   The company fails to submit one-time transfers of stock options to a
       shareholder vote;

   o   The company fails to fulfill the terms of a burn rate commitment made to
       shareholders;

   o   The company has problematic pay practices. Problematic pay practices may
       warrant withholding votes from the CEO and potentially the entire board
       as well.

Other Problematic Governance Practices

VOTE WITHHOLD/AGAINST the entire board of directors (except new nominees, who
should be considered on a CASE-by-CASE basis), if:

   o   The company's proxy indicates that not all directors attended 75 percent
       of the aggregate board and committee meetings, but fails to provide the
       required disclosure of the names of the director(s) involved. If this
       information cannot be obtained, withhold from all incumbent directors;


<PAGE>


   o   The board lacks accountability and oversight, coupled with sustained poor
       performance relative to peers. Sustained poor performance is measured by
       one- and three-year total shareholder returns in the bottom half of a
       company's four-digit GICS industry group (Russell 3000 companies only).
       Take into consideration the company's five-year total shareholder return
       and five-year operational metrics. Problematic provisions include but are
       not limited to:

        -   A classified board structure;

        -   A supermajority vote requirement;

        -   Majority vote standard for director elections with no carve out
            for contested elections;

        -   The inability for shareholders to call special meetings;

        -   The inability for shareholders to act by written consent;

        -   A dual-class structure; and/or

        -   A non-shareholder approved poison pill.


Under extraordinary circumstances, vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from directors
individually, committee members, or the entire board, due to:


   o   Material failures of governance, stewardship, or fiduciary
       responsibilities at the company;

   o   Failure to replace management as appropriate; or

   o   gregious actions related to the director(s)' service on other boards
       that raise substantial doubt about his or her ability to effectively
       oversee management and serve the best interests of shareholders at any
       company.


Board Responsiveness

Vote WITHHOLD/AGAINST the entire board of directors (except new nominees, who
should be considered on a CASE-by-CASE basis), if:

   o   The board failed to act on a shareholder proposal that received approval
       by a majority of the shares outstanding the previous year (a management
       proposal with other than a FOR recommendation by management will not be
       considered as sufficient action taken);

   o   The board failed to act on a shareholder proposal that received approval
       of the majority of shares cast for the previous two consecutive years (a
       management proposal with other than a FOR recommendation by management
       will not be considered as sufficient action taken);

   o   The board failed to act on takeover offers where the majority of the
       shareholders tendered their shares; or


<PAGE>


   o   At the previous board election, any director received more than 50
       percent withhold/against votes of the shares cast and the company has
       failed to address the issue(s) that caused the high withhold/against
       vote.


Director Independence

Vote WITHHOLD/AGAINST Inside Directors and Affiliated Outside Directors (per
the Categorization of Directors in the Summary Guidelines) when:

   o   The inside or affiliated outside director serves on any of the three key
       committees: audit, compensation, or nominating;

   o   The company lacks an audit, compensation, or nominating committee so that
       the full board functions as that committee;

   o   The company lacks a formal nominating committee, even if the board
       attests that the independent directors fulfill the functions of such a
       committee; or

   o   The full board is less than majority independent.


Director Competence

Vote AGAINST or WITHHOLD from individual directors who:

   o   Attend less than 75 percent of the board and committee meetings without a
       valid excuse, such as illness, service to the nation, work on behalf of
       the company, or funeral obligations. If the company provides meaningful
       public or private disclosure explaining the director's absences, evaluate
       the information on a CASE-BY-CASE basis taking into account the following
       factors:

        -   Degree to which absences were due to an unavoidable conflict;

        -   Pattern of absenteeism; and

        -   Other extraordinary circumstances underlying the director's absence;

   o   Sit on more than six public company boards;

   o   Are CEOs of public companies who sit on the boards of more than two
       public companies besides their own-- withhold only at their outside
       boards.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Voting for Director Nominees in Contested Elections

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on the election of directors in contested elections,
considering the following factors:

   o   Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to its
       industry;

   o   Management's track record;

   o   Background to the proxy contest;


<PAGE>


   o   Qualifications of director nominees (both slates);

   o   Strategic plan of dissident slate and quality of critique against
       management;

   o   Likelihood that the proposed goals and objectives can be achieved
       (both slates);

   o   Stock ownership positions.


                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Independent Chair (Separate Chair/CEO)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requiring that the chairman's position
be filled by an independent director, unless the company satisfies all of the
following criteria: The company maintains the following counterbalancing
features:

   o   Designated lead director, elected by and from the independent board
       members with clearly delineated and comprehensive duties. (The role may
       alternatively reside with a presiding director, vice chairman, or
       rotating lead director; however the director must serve a minimum of one
       year in order to qualify as a lead director.) The duties should include,
       but are not limited to, the following:

        -   presides at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is not
            present, including executive sessions of the independent directors;

        -  serves as liaison between the chairman and the independent directors;

        -  approves information sent to the board;

        -  approves meeting agendas for the board;

        -  approves meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time
           for discussion of all agenda items;

        -  has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;

        -  if requested by major shareholders, ensures that he is available
           for consultation and direct communication;

   o   Two-thirds independent board;

   o   All independent key committees;

   o   Established governance guidelines;

   o   A company in the Russell 3000 universe must not have exhibited sustained
       poor total shareholder return (TSR) performance, defined as one- and
       three-year TSR in the bottom half of the company's four-digit GICS
       industry group within the Russell 3000 only), unless there has been a
       change in the Chairman/CEO position within that time;

   o   The company does not have any problematic governance or management
       issues, examples of which include, but are not limited to:

        -   Egregious compensation practices;


<PAGE>


        -   Multiple related-party transactions or other issues putting
            director independence at risk;

        -   Corporate and/or management scandals;

        -   Excessive problematic corporate governance provisions; or

        -   Flagrant board or management actions with potential or realized
            negative impact on shareholders.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]


Shareholder Rights & Defenses:

Net Operating Loss (NOL) Protective Amendments

For management proposals to adopt a protective amendment for the stated purpose
of protecting a company's net operating losses ("NOLs"), the following factors
should be considered on a CASE-BY-CASE basis:

   o   The ownership threshold (NOL protective amendments generally prohibit
       stock ownership transfers that would result in a new5-percent holder or
       increase the stock ownership percentage of an existing five-percent
       holder);

   o   The value of the NOLs;

   o   Shareholder protection mechanisms (sunset provision or commitment to
       cause expiration of the protective amendment upon exhaustion or
       expiration of the NOL);

   o   The company's existing governance structure including: board
       independence, existing takeover defenses, track record of responsiveness
       to shareholders, and any other problematic governance concerns; and

   o   Any other factors that may be applicable.


                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Poison Pills- Shareholder Proposals to put Pill to a Vote and/or Adopt a
Pill Policy

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that the company submit its poison
pill to a shareholder vote or redeem it UNLESS the company has: (1) A
shareholder approved poison pill in place; or (2) The company has adopted a
policy concerning the adoption of a pill in the future specifying that the board
will only adopt a shareholder rights plan if either:

   o   Shareholders have approved the adoption of the plan; or

   o   The board, in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities,
       determines that it is in the best interest of shareholders under the
       circumstances to adopt a pill without the delay in adoption that would
       result from seeking stockholder approval (i.e., the "fiduciary out"
       provision). A poison pill adopted under this fiduciary out will be put
       to a shareholder ratification vote within 12 months of adoption or
       expire. If the pill is not approved by a majority of the votes cast on
       this issue, the plan will immediately terminate.


<PAGE>


If the shareholder proposal calls for a time period of less than 12 months for
shareholder ratification after adoption, vote FOR the proposal, but add the
caveat that a vote within 12 months would be considered sufficient
implementation.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Poison Pills- Management Proposals to Ratify Poison Pill

Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals on poison pill ratification, focusing
on the features of the shareholder rights plan. Rights plans should contain the
following attributes:

   o   No lower than a 20% trigger, flip-in or flip-over;

   o   A term of no more than three years;

   o   No dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the
       ability of a future board to redeem the pill;

   o   Shareholder redemption feature (qualifying offer clause); if the board
       refuses to redeem the pill 90 days after a qualifying offer is announced,
       10 percent of the shares may call a special meeting or seek a written
       consent to vote on rescinding the pill.

In addition, the rationale for adopting the pill should be thoroughly explained
by the company. In examining the request for the pill, take into consideration
the company's existing governance structure, including: board independence,
existing takeover defenses, and any problematic governance concerns.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Poison Pills- Management Proposals to ratify a Pill to preserve Net Operating
Losses (NOLs)

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on management proposals for poison pill ratification.For
management proposals to adopt a poison pill for the stated purpose of preserving
a company's net operating losses ("NOLs"), the following factors are considered
on a CASE-BY-CASE basis:

   o   The ownership threshold to transfer (NOL pills generally have a trigger
       slightly below 5%);

   o   The value of the NOLs;

   o   The term;

   o   Shareholder protection mechanisms (sunset provision, or commitment to
       cause expiration of the pill upon exhaustion or expiration of NOLs);

   o   The company's existing governance structure including: board
       independence, existing takeover defenses, track record of responsiveness
       to shareholders, and any other problematic governance concerns; and

   o   Any other factors that may be applicable.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Shareholder Ability to Call Special Meetings

Vote AGAINST management or shareholder proposals to restrict or prohibit
shareholders' ability to call special meetings.

Generally vote FOR management or shareholder proposals that provide
shareholders with the ability to call special meetings taking into account
the following factors:

   o   Shareholders' current right to call special meetings;

   o   Minimum ownership threshold necessary to call special meetings (10%
       preferred);

   o   The inclusion of exclusionary or prohibitive language;

   o   Investor ownership structure; and

   o   Shareholder support of and management's response to previous shareholder
       proposals.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Supermajority Vote Requirements

Vote AGAINST proposals to require a supermajority shareholder vote.

Vote FOR management or shareholder proposals to reduce supermajority vote
requirements. However, for companies with shareholder(s) who have significant
ownership levels, vote CASE-BY-CASE, taking into account:

   o   Ownership structure;

   o   Quorum requirements; and

   o   Supermajority vote requirements.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Capital/Restructuring:

Common Stock Authorization

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of shares of common stock
authorized for issuance. Take into account company-specific factors which
include, at a minimum, the following:

   o   Past Board Performance:

        o   The company's use of authorized shares during the last three years;
        o   One- and three-year total shareholder return; and
        o   The board's governance structure and practices;

   o   The Current Request:

        o   Disclosure in the proxy statement of the specific reasons for the
            proposed increase;

        o   The dilutive impact of the request as determined through an
            allowable cap generated by RiskMetrics' quantitative model, which
            examines the company's need for shares and its three-year total
            shareholder return; and

        o   Risks to shareholders of not approving the request.

Vote AGAINST proposals at companies with more than one class of common stock to
increase the number of authorized shares of the class that has superior voting
rights.

Preferred Stock

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of shares of preferred
stock authorized for issuance. Take into account company-specific factors that
include, at a minimum, the following:

   o   Past Board Performance:

        o   The company's use of authorized preferred shares during the last
            three years;

        o   One-and three-year total shareholder return; and

        o   The board's governance structure and practices;

   o   The Current Request:

        o   Disclosure in the proxy statement of specific reasons for the
            proposed increase;

        o   In cases where the company has existing authorized preferred stock,
            the dilutive impact of the request as determined through an
            allowable cap generated by RiskMetrics' quantitative model, which
            examines the company's need for shares and three-year total
            shareholder return; and

        o   Whether the shares requested are blank check preferred shares, and
            whether they are declawed.

Vote AGAINST proposals at companies with more than one class or series of
preferred stock to increase the number of authorized shares of the class or
series that has superior voting rights.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]


Mergers and Acquisitions

Vote CASE -BY- CASE on mergers and acquisitions. Review and evaluate the merits
and drawbacks of the proposed transaction, balancing various and sometimes
countervailing factors including:

   o   Valuation - Is the value to be received by the target shareholders (or
       paid by the acquirer) reasonable? While the fairness opinion may provide
       an initial starting point for assessing valuation reasonableness,
       emphasis is placed on the offer premium, market reaction and strategic
       rationale.

   o   Market reaction - How has the market responded to the proposed deal? A
       negative market reaction should cause closer scrutiny of a deal.

   o   Strategic rationale - Does the deal make sense strategically? From where
       is the value derived? Cost and revenue synergies should not be overly
       aggressive or optimistic, but reasonably achievable. Management should
       also have a favorable track record of successful integration of
       historical acquisitions.

   o   Negotiations and process - Were the terms of the transaction negotiated
       at arm's-length? Was the process fair and equitable? A fair process helps
       to ensure the best price for shareholders. Significant negotiation "wins"
       can also signify the deal makers' competency. The comprehensiveness of
       the sales process (e.g., full auction, partial auction, no auction) can
       also affect shareholder value.

   o   Conflict of interest - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction
       disproportionately and inappropriately as compared to non-insider
       shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the directors and
       officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a merger
       than if they did not hold these interests. Consider whether these
       interests may have influenced these directors and officers to support or
       recommend the merger. The change-in-control figure presented in the "RMG
       Transaction Summary" section of this report is an aggregate figure that
       can in certain cases be a misleading indicator of the true value transfer
       from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure appears to be excessive,
       analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a potential
       conflict exists.

   o   Governance - Will the combined company have a better or worse governance
       profile than the current governance profiles of the respective parties to
       the transaction? If the governance profile is to change for the worse,
       the burden is on the company to prove that other issues (such as
       valuation) outweigh any deterioration in governance.

Compensation:


Executive Pay Evaluation

Underlying all evaluations are five global principles that most investors
expect corporations to adhere to in designing and administering executive and
director compensation programs:


   1.  Maintain appropriate pay-for-performance alignment, with emphasis on
       long-term shareholder value: This principle encompasses overall executive
       pay practices, which must be designed to attract, retain, and
       appropriately motivate the key employees who drive shareholder value
       creation over the long term. It will take into consideration, among other
       factors, the link between pay and performance; the mix between fixed and
       variable pay; performance goals; and equity-based plan costs;

   2.  Avoid arrangements that risk "pay for failure": This principle addresses
       the appropriateness of long or indefinite contracts, excessive severance
       packages, and guaranteed compensation;

   3.  Maintain an independent and effective compensation committee: This
       principle promotes oversight of executive pay programs by directors with
       appropriate skills, knowledge, experience, and a sound process for
       compensation decision-making (e.g., including access to independent
       expertise and advice when needed);

   4.  Provide shareholders with clear, comprehensive compensation disclosures:
       This principle underscores the importance of informative and timely
       disclosures that enable shareholders to evaluate executive pay practices
       fully and fairly;

   5.  Avoid inappropriate pay to non-executive directors: This principle
       recognizes the interests of shareholders in ensuring that compensation to
       outside directors does not compromise their independence and ability to


<PAGE>


       make appropriate judgments in overseeing managers' pay and performance.
       At the market level, it may incorporate a variety of generally accepted
       best practices.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]


Equity Compensation Plans


Vote CASE-BY-CASE on equity-based compensation plans. Vote AGAINST the equity
plan if any of the following factors apply:

   o   The total cost of the company's equity plans is unreasonable;

   o   The plan expressly permits the repricing of stock options/stock
       appreciate rights (SARs) without prior shareholder approval;

   o   The CEO is a participant in the proposed equity-based compensation plan
       and there is a disconnect between CEO pay and the company's performance
       where over 50 percent of the year-over-year increase is attributed to
       equity awards (see Pay-for-Performance);

   o   The company's three year burn rate exceeds the greater of 2% or the mean
       plus one standard deviation of its industry group;

   o   Liberal Change of Control Definition: The plan provides for the
       acceleration of vesting of equity awards even though an actual change in
       control may not occur (e.g., upon shareholder approval of a transaction
       or the announcement of a tender offer); or

   o   The plan is a vehicle for problematic pay practices.


                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]


Other Compensation Proposals and Policies


Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation- Management Proposals (Management
Say-on-Pay) In general, the management say on pay (MSOP) ballot item is the
primary focus of voting on executive pay practices- dissatisfaction with
compensation practices can be expressed by voting against the MSOP rather than
withholding or voting against the compensation committee. However, if there is
no MSOP on which to express the dissatisfaction, then the secondary target will
be members of the compensation committee. In addition, in egregious cases, or if
the board fails to respond to concerns raised by a prior MSOP proposal; then
vote withhold or against compensation committee member (or, if the full board is
deemed accountable, to all directors). If the negative factors impact
equity-based plans, then vote AGAINST an equity-based plan proposal presented
for shareholder approval.

Evaluate executive pay and practices, as well as certain aspects of
outside director compensation, on a CASE-BY-CASE basis.


<PAGE>


Vote AGAINST management say on pay (MSOP) proposals, AGAINST/WITHHOLD on
compensation committee members (or, in rare cases where the full board is
deemed responsible, all directors including the CEO), and/or AGAINST an
equity-based incentive plan proposal if:

   o   There is a misalignment between CEO pay and company performance (pay for
       performance);

   o   The company maintains problematic pay practices;

   o   The board exhibits poor communication and responsiveness to shareholders.

Additional CASE-BY-CASE considerations for the management say on pay (MSOP)
proposals:

   o   Evaluation of performance metrics in short-term and long-term plans, as
       discussed and explained in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis (CD&A).
       Consider the measures, goals, and target awards reported by the company
       for executives' short- and long-term incentive awards: disclosure,
       explanation of their alignment with the company's business strategy, and
       whether goals appear to be sufficiently challenging in relation to
       resulting payouts;

   o   opportunities. Consider the rationale stated by the company for
       constituents in its pay benchmarking peer group, as well as the benchmark
       targets it uses to set or validate executives' pay (e.g., median, 75th
       percentile, etc.,) to ascertain whether the benchmarking process is sound
       or may result in pay "ratcheting" due to inappropriate peer group
       constituents (e.g., much larger companies) or targeting (e.g., above
       median); and

   o   Balance of performance-based versus non-performance-based pay. Consider
       the ratio of performance-based (not including plain vanilla stock
       options) vs. non-performance-based pay elements reported for the CEO's
       latest reported fiscal year compensation, especially in conjunction with
       concerns about other factors such as performance metrics/goals,
       benchmarking practices, and pay-for-performance disconnects.


Pay for Performance

Evaluate the alignment of the CEO's pay with performance over time, focusing
particularly on companies that have underperformed their peers over a sustained
period. From a shareholders' perspective, performance is predominantly gauged by
the company's stock performance over time. Even when financial or operational
measures are utilized in incentive awards, the achievement related to these
measures should ultimately translate into superior shareholder returns in the
long-term.

Focus on companies with sustained underperformance relative to peers,
considering the following key factors:

   o   Whether a company's one-year and three-year total shareholder returns
       ("TSR") are in the bottom half of its industry group (i.e., four-digit
       GICS - Global Industry Classification Group); and

   o   Whether the total compensation of a CEO who has served at least two
       consecutive fiscal years is aligned with the company's total shareholder
       return over time, including both recent and long-term periods.


<PAGE>


If a company falls in the bottom half of its four-digit GICS, further analysis
of the CD&A is required to better understand the various pay elements and
whether they create or reinforce shareholder alignment. Also assess the CEO's
pay relative to the company's TSR over a time horizon of at least five years.
The most recent year-over-year increase or decrease in pay remains a key
consideration, but there will be additional emphasis on the LONG TERM TREND OF
CEO TOTAL COMPENSATION RELATIVE TO SHAREHOLDER RETURN. ALSO CONSIDER THE MIX OF
performance-based compensation relative to total compensation. In general,
standard stock options or time-vested restricted stock are not considered to be
performance-based. If a company provides performance-based incentives to its
executives, the company is highly encouraged to provide the complete disclosure
of the performance measure and goals (hurdle rate) so that shareholders can
assess the rigor of the performance program. The use of non-GAAP financial
metrics also makes it very challenging for shareholders to ascertain the rigor
of the program as shareholders often cannot tell the type of adjustments being
made and if the adjustments were made consistently. Complete and transparent
disclosure helps shareholders to better understand the company's pay for
performance linkage.

Problematic Pay Practices

The focus is on executive compensation practices that contravene the global pay
principles, including:

   o   Problematic practices related to non-performance-based compensation
       elements;

   o   Incentives that may motivate excessive risk-taking; and

   o   Options Backdating.


Non-Performance based Compensation Elements
Companies adopt a variety of pay arrangements that may be acceptable in their
particular industries, or unique for a particular situation, and all companies
are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. However, there are certain adverse
practices that are particularly contrary to a performance-based pay philosophy,
including guaranteed pay and excessive or inappropriate non-performance-based
pay elements.
While not exhaustive, this is the list of practices that carry greatest weight
in this consideration and may result in negative vote recommendations on a
stand-alone basis. For more details, please refer to RMG's Compensation FAQ
document: http://www.riskmetrics.com/policy/2010_compensation_FAQ:

   o   Multi-year guarantees for salary increases, non-performance based
       bonuses, and equity compensation;

   o   Including additional years of unworked service that result in significant
       additional benefits, without sufficient justification, or including
       long-term equity awards in the pension calculation;

   o   Perquisites for former and/or retired executives, and extraordinary
       relocation benefits (including home buyouts) for current executives;

   o   Change-in-control payments exceeding 3 times base salary and target
       bonus; change-in-control payments without job loss or substantial
       diminution of duties ("Single Triggers"); new or materially amended
       agreements that provide for "modified single triggers" (under which an


<PAGE>


       executive may voluntarily leave for any reason and still receive the
       change-in-control severance package); new or materially amended
       agreements that provide for an excise tax gross-up (including "modified
       gross-ups");

   o   Tax Reimbursements related to executive perquisites or other payments
       such as personal use of corporate aircraft, executive life insurance,
       bonus, etc; (see also excise tax gross-ups above)

   o   Dividends or dividend equivalents paid on unvested performance shares or
       units;

   o   Executives using company stock in hedging activities, such as "cashless"
       collars, forward sales, equity swaps or other similar arrangements; or

   o   Repricing or replacing of underwater stock options/stock appreciation
       rights without prior shareholder approval (including cash buyouts and
       voluntary surrender/subsequent regrant of underwater options).


Incentives that may Motivate Excessive Risk-Taking

Assess company policies and disclosure related to compensation that could
incentivize excessive risk-taking, for example:

   o   Guaranteed bonuses;

   o   A single performance metric used for short- and long-term plans;

   o   Lucrative severance packages;

   o   High pay opportunities relative to industry peers;

   o   Disproportionate supplemental pensions; or

   o   Mega annual equity grants that provide unlimited upside with no downside
       risk.


Factors that potentially mitigate the impact of risky incentives include
rigorous claw-back provisions and robust stock ownership/holding guidelines.

Options Backdating

Vote CASE-by-CASE on options backdating issues. Generally, when a company has
recently practiced options backdating, WITHHOLD from or vote AGAINST the
compensation committee, depending on the severity of the practices and the
subsequent corrective actions on the part of the board. When deciding on votes
on compensation committee members who oversaw questionable options grant
practices or current compensation committee members who fail to respond to the
issue proactively, consider several factors, including, but not limited to, the
following:

   o   Reason and motive for the options backdating issue, such as inadvertent
       vs. deliberate grant date changes;

   o   Duration of options backdating;

   o   Size of restatement due to options backdating;

   o   Corrective actions taken by the board or compensation committee, such as
       canceling or re-pricing backdated options, the recouping of option gains
       on backdated grants; and


<PAGE>


   o   grant schedule or window period for equity grants in the future.

A CASE-by-CASE analysis approach allows distinctions to be made between
companies that had "sloppy" plan administration versus those that acted
deliberately and/or committed fraud, as well as those companies that
subsequently took corrective action. Cases where companies have committed fraud
are considered most egregious.

Board Communications and Responsiveness
Consider the following factors on a CASE-BY-CASE basis when evaluating ballot
items related to executive pay:

   o   Poor disclosure practices, including:

        -   Unclear explanation of how the CEO is involved in the pay setting
            process;

        -   Retrospective performance targets and methodology not discussed;

        -   Methodology for benchmarking practices and/or peer group not
            disclosed and explained.

   o   Board's responsiveness to investor input and engagement on compensation
       issues, for example:

        -   Failure to respond to majority-supported shareholder proposals on
            executive pay topics; or

        -   Failure to respond to concerns raised in connection with significant
            pposition to MSOP proposals.


                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Option Exchange Programs/Repricing Options

Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals seeking approval to exchange/reprice
options, taking into consideration: o Historic trading patterns--the stock price
should not be so volatile that the options are likely to be back "in-the-money"
over the near term;

   o   Rationale for the re-pricing--was the stock price decline beyond
       management's control?

   o   Is this a value-for-value exchange?

   o   Are surrendered stock options added back to the plan reserve?

   o   Option vesting--does the new option vest immediately or is there a
       black-out period?

   o   erm of the option--the term should remain the same as that of the
       replaced option;

   o   Exercise price--should be set at fair market or a premium to market;

   o   Participants--executive officers and directors should be excluded.


<PAGE>


If the surrendered options are added back to the equity plans for re-issuance,
then also take into consideration the company's total cost of equity plans and
its three-year average burn rate. In addition to the above considerations,
evaluate the intent, rationale, and timing of the repricing proposal. The
proposal should clearly articulate why the board is choosing to conduct an
exchange program at this point in time. Repricing underwater options after a
recent precipitous drop in the company's stock price demonstrates poor timing.
Repricing after a recent decline in stock price triggers additional scrutiny and
a potential AGAINST vote on the proposal. At a minimum, the decline should not
have happened within the past year. Also, consider the terms of the surrendered
options, such as the grant date, exercise price and vesting schedule. Grant
dates of surrendered options should be far enough back (two to three years) so
as not to suggest that repricings are being done to take advantage of short-term
downward price movements. Similarly, the exercise price of surrendered options
should be above the 52-week high for the stock price. Vote FOR shareholder
proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.

Shareholder Proposals on Compensation


Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation (Say-on-Pay)

Generally, vote FOR shareholder proposals that call for non-binding shareholder
ratification of the compensation of the Named Executive Officers and the
accompanying narrative disclosure of material factors provided to understand the
Summary Compensation Table.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Golden Coffins/Executive Death Benefits

Generally vote FOR proposals calling companies to adopt a policy of obtaining
shareholder approval for any future agreements and corporate policies that could
oblige the company to make payments or awards following the death of a senior
executive in the form of unearned salary or bonuses, accelerated vesting or the
continuation in force of unvested equity grants, perquisites and other payments
or awards made in lieu of compensation. This would not apply to any benefit
programs or equity plan proposals that the broad-based employee population is
eligible.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Recoup Bonuses

Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to recoup unearned incentive bonuses or
other incentive payments made to senior executives if it is later determined
that the figures upon which incentive compensation is earned later turn out to
have been in error. This is line with the clawback provision in the Trouble
Asset Relief Program. Many companies have adopted policies that permit
recoupment in cases where fraud, misconduct, or negligence significantly
contributed to a restatement of financial results that led to the awarding of
unearned incentive compensation. RMG will take into consideration:

   o   If the company has adopted a formal recoupment bonus policy;

   o   If the company has chronic restatement history or material financial
       problems; or

   o   If the company's policy substantially addresses the concerns raised by
       the proponent.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Stock Ownership or Holding Period Guidelines

Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum amount of
stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on
the board. While RMG favors stock ownership on the part of directors, the
company should determine the appropriate ownership requirement.

Vote on a CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to adopt
policies requiring Named Executive Officers to retain 75% of the shares acquired
through compensation plans while employed and/or for two years following the
termination of their employment, and to report to shareholders regarding this
policy. The following factors will be taken into account:


   o   Whether the company has any holding period, retention ratio, or officer
       ownership requirements in place. These should consist of:

        -   Rigorous stock ownership guidelines, or

        -   A holding period requirement coupled with a significant long-term
            ownership requirement, or

        -   A meaningful retention ratio,

   o   Actual officer stock ownership and the degree to which it meets or
       exceeds the proponent's suggested holding period/retention ratio or the
       company's own stock ownership or retention requirements.

   o   Problematic pay practices, current and past, which may promote a
       short-term versus a long-term focus.

A rigorous stock ownership guideline should be at least 10x base salary for the
CEO, with the multiple declining for other executives. A meaningful retention
ratio should constitute at least 50 percent of the stock received from equity
awards (on a net proceeds basis) held on a long-term basis, such as the
executive's tenure with the company or even a few years past the executive's
termination with the company.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

6. Social/Environmental Issues:

Overall Approach

When evaluating social and environmental shareholder proposals, RMG considers
the following factors:

   o   Whether adoption of the proposal is likely to enhance or protect
       shareholder value;

   o   Whether the information requested concerns business issues that relate to
       a meaningful percentage of the company's business as measured by sales,
       assets, and earnings;

   o   The degree to which the company's stated position on the issues raised in
       the proposal could affect its reputation or sales, or leave it vulnerable
       to a boycott or selective purchasing;


<PAGE>



   o   Whether the issues presented are more appropriately/effectively dealt
       with through governmental or company-specific action;

   o   Whether the company has already responded in some appropriate manner to
       the request embodied in the proposal;

   o   Whether the company's analysis and voting recommendation to shareholders
       are persuasive;

   o   What other companies have done in response to the issue addressed in the
       proposal;

   o   Whether the proposal itself is well framed and the cost of preparing the
       report is reasonable;

   o   Whether implementation of the proposal's request would achieve the
       proposal's objectives;

   o   Whether the subject of the proposal is best left to the discretion of the
       board;

   o   Whether the requested information is available to shareholders either
       from the company or from a publicly available source; and

   o   Whether providing this information would reveal proprietary or
       confidential information that would place the company at a competitive
       disadvantage.


                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Board Diversity

Generally vote FOR requests for reports on the company's efforts to diversify
the board, unless:

   o   The gender and racial minority representation of the company's board is
       reasonably inclusive in relation to companies of similar size and
       business; and

   o   The board already reports on its nominating procedures and gender and
       racial minority initiatives on the board and within the company.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking the company to increase the gender and
racial minority representation on its board, taking into account:

   o   The degree of existing gender and racial minority diversity on the
       company's board and among its executive officers;

   o   The level of gender and racial minority representation that exists at the
       company's industry peers;

   o   The company's established process for addressing gender and racial
       minority board representation;

   o   Whether the proposal includes an overly prescriptive request to amend
       nominating committee charter language;


<PAGE>


   o   The independence of the company's nominating committee;

   o   The company uses an outside search firm to identify potential director
       nominees; and

   o   Whether the company has had recent controversies, fines, or litigation
       regarding equal employment practices.


                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation, and Domestic Partner Benefits

Generally vote FOR proposals seeking to amend a company's EEO statement or
diversity policies to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and/or
gender identity, unless the change would result in excessive costs for the
company.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to extend company benefits to, or
eliminate benefits from domestic partners. Decisions regarding benefits should
be left to the discretion of the company.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting a report on greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions from company operations and/or products and operations, unless:

   o   The company already provides current, publicly-available information on
       the impacts that GHG emissions may have on the company as well as
       associated company policies and procedures to address related risks
       and/or opportunities;

   o   The company's level of disclosure is comparable to that of industry
       peers; and

   o   There are no significant, controversies, fines, penalties, or litigation
       associated with the company's GHG emissions.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals that call for the adoption of GHG reduction
goals from products and operations, taking into account:

   o   Overly prescriptive requests for the reduction in GHG emissions by
       specific amounts or within a specific time frame;

o      Whether company disclosure lags behind industry peers;

o      Whether the company has been the subject of recent, significant
       violations, fines, litigation, or controversy related to GHG emissions;

o      The feasibility of reduction of GHGs given the company's product line and
       current technology and; o Whether the company already provides meaningful
       disclosure on GHG emissions from its products and operations.

                                [GRAPHIC OMITTED]

Political Contributions and Trade Association Spending

Generally vote AGAINST proposals asking the company to affirm political
nonpartisanship in the workplace so long as:

   o   There are no recent, significant controversies, fines or litigation
       regarding the company's political contributions or trade association
       spending; and

   o   The company has procedures in place to ensure that employee contributions
       to company-sponsored political action committees (PACs) are strictly
       voluntary and prohibits coercion.


<PAGE>


Vote AGAINST proposals to publish in newspapers and public media the company's
political contributions. Such publications could present significant cost to the
company without providing commensurate value to shareholders.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to improve the disclosure of a company's
political contributions and trade association spending, considering:

   o   Recent significant controversy or litigation related to the company's
       political contributions or governmental affairs; and

   o   The public availability of a company policy on political contributions
       and trade association spending including information on the types of
       organizations supported, the business rationale for supporting these
       organizations, and the oversight and compliance procedures related to
       such expenditures of corporate assets.

Vote AGAINST proposals barring the company from making political contributions.
Businesses are affected by legislation at the federal, state, and local level
and barring political contributions can put the company at a competitive
disadvantage.

Vote AGAINST proposals asking for a list of company executives,
directors, consultants, legal counsels, lobbyists, or investment bankers that
have prior government service and whether such service had a bearing on the
business of the company. Such a list would be burdensome to prepare without
providing any meaningful information to shareholders.

Labor and Human Rights Standards

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting a report on company or company supplier
labor and/or human rights standards and policies unless such information is
already publicly disclosed.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to implement company or company supplier labor
and/or human rights standards and policies, considering:


   o   The degree to which existing relevant policies and practices are
       disclosed;

   o   Whether or not existing relevant policies are consistent with
       internationally recognized standards;

   o   Whether company facilities and those of its suppliers are monitored and
       how;

   o   Company participation in fair labor organizations or other
       internationally recognized human rights initiatives;

   o   Scope and nature of business conducted in markets known to have higher
       risk of workplace labor/human rights abuse;

   o   Recent, significant company controversies, fines, or litigation regarding
       human rights at the company or its suppliers;

   o   The scope of the request; and

   o   Deviation from industry sector peer company standards and practices.

Sustainability Reporting

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting the company to report on its policies,
initiatives, and oversight mechanisms related to social, economic, and
environmental sustainability, unless:

   o   The company already discloses similar information through existing
       reports or policies such as an Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS)
       report; a comprehensive Code of Corporate Conduct; and/or a Diversity
       Report; or

   o   The company has formally committed to the implementation of a reporting
       program based on Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines or a
       similar standard within a specified time frame

Potential Conflicts of Interests

          In general, Four Corners seeks to allocate the purchase and sale of
corporate loans to clients in a fair and equitable manner to quickly and
prudently create a well-constructed, fully invested portfolio of corporate
loans. Since Four Corners' clients have varying investment restrictions, and
because of the constraining mechanics of the corporate loan market, allocation
of trades through methods such as pro-rata allocation are not feasible.
Therefore, the allocation of corporate loan purchases and sales to various
accounts is generally based on factors such as the client's investment
restrictions and objectives, including expected liquidity and/or third party
credit ratings, the client's acceptance or rejection of prospective investments,
if applicable, and the relative percentage of invested assets of a client's
portfolio, among others. Assets may be disproportionately allocated to accounts
during their initial investment (ramp up) period, notwithstanding that other
accounts may also have assets available for investment. Such disproportionate
allocation to accounts during the ramp-up process may have a detrimental effect
on other accounts. Subject to the foregoing, whenever Four Corners' clients have
available funds for investment, investments suitable and appropriate for each
will be allocated in a manner Four Corners believes to be equitable to each,
although such allocation may result in a delay in one or more client accounts
being fully invested that would not occur if an allocation to other client
accounts were not made. Moreover, it is possible that due to differing
investment objectives or for other reasons, Four Corners and its affiliates may
purchase securities or loans of an issuer for one client and at approximately
the same time recommend selling or sell the same or similar types of securities
or loans for another client. For these and other reasons, not all portfolios
will participate in the gains or losses experienced by other portfolios with
similar investment objectives.


(a)(3)   Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management
Team Members


INFORMATION PROVIDED AS OF AUGUST 2, 2010

          Portfolio Manager and Management Team compensation is typically
comprised of a base salary and a bonus. There are no pre-determined formulas to
determine base salaries or bonus amounts. Bonuses for all employees, including
the Portfolio Managers, are discretionary. In addition, the Portfolio Managers
have stock options of Macquarie. These options are in varying amounts and are
subject to certain vesting and other provisions of the Macquarie option plan.
Finally, the Portfolio Managers are Members of the entity that Macquarie
recently purchased, and there are certain payments associated with that purchase
which will be paid over time. A portion of those payments is based on achieving
certain revenue targets.


          The Portfolio Managers' salaries are set at certain levels and may be
raised at the discretion of Macquarie. Bonuses are entirely discretionary and
are likely to be related to, among other things, business unit profitability and
personal performance. Compensation is determined without regard to the
performance of any one particular fund. The Portfolio Managers and the
Management Team have no direct incentive to take undue risks when individual
fund performance is lagging.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This code of conduct is being adopted by the investment companies
advised by First Trust Advisors L.P., from time to time, (the "Funds"). The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable assets that are vital to the
Funds' success. Each officer of the Funds, and officers and employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters, including each of the
Funds' senior financial officers ("SFOs"), is responsible for conducting each
Fund's business in a manner that demonstrates a commitment to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President), the Controller (who is the principal accounting officer), and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer), and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds, First Trust Advisors L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Rule 17j-1 Code"). These Codes of Ethics are designed to prevent
certain conflicts of interest that may arise when officers, employees, or
directors of the Funds and the foregoing entities know about present or future
Fund transactions and/or have the power to influence those transactions, and
engage in transactions with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise take advantage of their position and knowledge with
respect to those securities. In an effort to prevent these conflicts and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1, the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions and conduct that create conflicts of interest, and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was designed to address corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely disclosing financial information. Under Section
406 of the Act, all public companies (including the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent future situations (such as occurred in well-reported situations
involving such companies as Enron and WorldCom) where a company creates an
environment in which employees are afraid to express their opinions or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds have chosen to adopt a senior financial officer Code of
Conduct to encourage their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust Advisors or First Trust Portfolios to act ethically and to question
potentially unethical or illegal practices, and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.


<PAGE>


II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT

         The purposes of this Code are:

                    A. To promote honest and ethical conduct, including the
         ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
         personal and professional relationships;

                    B. To promote full, fair, accurate, timely, and
         understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Funds file
         with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the
         Funds make;

                    C. To promote compliance with applicable governmental laws,
         rules and regulations;

                    D. To encourage the prompt internal reporting to an
         appropriate person of violations of the Code; and

                    E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated W. Scott Jardine or other
appropriate officer designated by the President of the respective Funds to be
the Compliance Coordinator for the implementation and administration of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The Funds have adopted guidelines under which its SFOs perform their
duties. However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or distributor who participate in the preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                    A. Act with honesty and integrity and avoid violations of
         this Code, including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the
         Fund in personal and professional relationships.

                    B. Disclose to the Fund's Compliance Coordinator any
         material transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected
         to give rise to any violations of the Code, including actual or
         apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund. You should disclose these
         transactions or relationships whether you are involved or have only
         observed the transaction or relationship. If it is not possible to
         disclose the matter to the Compliance Coordinator, it should be
         disclosed to the Fund's Principal Financial Officer or Principal
         Executive Officer.

<PAGE>


                    C. Provide information to the Fund's other officers and
         appropriate employees of service providers (adviser, administrator,
         outside auditor, outside counsel, custodian, etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                    D. Endeavor to ensure full, fair, timely, accurate, and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                    E. Comply with the federal securities laws and other
         applicable laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                    F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care,
         competence and diligence, without misrepresenting material facts or
         allowing your independent judgment to be subordinated.

                    G. Respect the confidentiality of information acquired in
         the course of your work except when you have Fund approval to disclose
         it or where disclosure is otherwise legally mandated. You may not use
         confidential information acquired in the course of your work for
         personal advantage.

                    H. Share and maintain skills important and relevant to the
         Fund's needs.

                    I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your
         work environment.

                    J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources
         employed or entrusted to you.

                    K. Record or participate in the recording of entries in the
         Fund's books and records that are accurate to the best of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE

         SFOs and other parties subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting their request in writing to the Compliance Coordinator for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver. All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's shareholders to the extent required by SEC rules. A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code, however, shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

VII.      REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code must immediately report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the Audit Committee of the Fund Board. An example of a possible Code
violation is the preparation and filing of financial disclosure that omits
material facts, or that is accurate but is written in a way that obscures its
meaning.

          B. Because service providers such as an administrator, outside
accounting firm, and custodian provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements, you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal, or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct. You
should report these actions to the Compliance Coordinator even if you know, or
think, that the service provider has its own code of ethics for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other officers or employees who report violations or
suspected violations in good faith will not be subject to retaliation of any
kind. Reported violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.     VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this Code, regardless of whether this Code specifically refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary action,
up to and including termination of employment. A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940, state laws relating to duties owed by Fund directors and
officers, and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material misstatements in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material fact. These material
misstatements and omissions include financial statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B. Examples of criminal violations of the law include stealing,
embezzling, misapplying corporate or bank funds, making a payment for an
expressed purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments, whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to influence the judgment or actions
of political candidates, government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the Funds' activities. The Funds must and will report all suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.
