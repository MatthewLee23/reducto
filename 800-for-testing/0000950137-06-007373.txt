PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS, NET
ASSET VALUE (NAV) AND COMMON SHARE MARKET PRICE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES,
WHEN SOLD, MAY BE WORTH MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

The Lehman Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index is a broad-based statistical
composite of New York municipal bonds. The index does not include any expenses,
fees or sales charges, which would lower performance. The index is unmanaged and
should not be considered an investment. It is not possible to invest directly in
an index.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2006

MARKET CONDITIONS

The economy continued to grow during the six-month period ended April 30, 2006,
demonstrating some resiliency in the face of rising oil and other commodity
prices, the Gulf Coast hurricanes, and emerging weakness in the housing market.
This expansion was more modest in the final months of 2005, but gained
considerable momentum in the first quarter.

Against the backdrop of growth and good employment data, the Federal Open Market
Committee (the "Fed") continued raising the federal funds target rate during the
period, implementing four additional increases of 25 basis points each. These
moves brought the target rate to 4.75 percent. The final hike of the period
represented the fifteenth consecutive increase--the longest stretch of increases
in 25 years. As the period came to a close, market observers speculated about
the Fed's near-term intentions, given the central bank's view that although
longer-term inflation currently appeared contained, commodity prices could
amplify inflationary pressures.

Returns across the municipal bond market varied significantly. As investors
sought income opportunities, lower rated bonds outpaced investment-grade bonds
by a wide margin. Long-term bonds earned the best returns, broadly speaking,
while bonds in the three-to-seven year range posted the most muted gains.

Municipal bond issuance was robust during the final months of 2005. (In fact,
2005 marked a record high for municipal bond volume.) The tide changed in 2006,
however. As rising rates discouraged issuers from refinancing debt, national
municipal issuance dropped by approximately 25 percent in the first four months
of the year versus the same period in 2005. While supply ebbed, the market's
appetite for municipal bonds remained strong, with particularly heavy demand
from high yield municipal bond funds.

Although slowing refunding activity in 2006 contributed to a drop in issuance
that was in line with national trends, New York remained a leading issuer of
municipal bonds during the period. The state currently enjoys a stable credit
outlook, and economic growth has boosted state revenues. The securities and
tourism industries count among the state's bright spots, as does the real estate
market. Growth in professional and business services has served as a catalyst
for employment gains in the New York City metropolitan area and the Hudson
Valley region. Manufacturing activity, especially in upstate New York, remains a
notable pocket of economic weakness, however.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. On an NAV basis, the trust outperformed its benchmark index, the Lehman
Brothers New York Municipal Bond Index. On a market price basis, the trust
underperformed its benchmark.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information
and index definition.

The trust uses leverage to enhance its dividend to common shareholders. The
trust borrows money at short-term rates through the issuance of preferred
shares. The proceeds are reinvested in longer-term securities, taking advantage
of the difference between short- and longer-term rates. The Fed's policy of
raising interest rates throughout the period made the trust's borrowing activity
more expensive, which reduced the benefits of the trust's leverage activities.

We managed the trust according to a long-term "buy and hold" discipline anchored
by rigorous research. We sought what we believed to be high quality bonds with
attractive return potential and good liquidity. (Liquid securities are those for
which there is a robust market of purchasers and sellers.) We also engaged in
selective, opportunistic relative value trading, selling holdings to purchase
those which we believed offer more attractive characteristics.

We sought opportunities to enhance the trust's yield during the period. For
example, we added BBB rated tobacco revenue bonds. Our decision to increase
tobacco bond exposure reflected our analytical findings of strong tobacco
industry fundamentals and an improving litigation environment. As of the close
of the period, tobacco issues represented more than 10 percent of the trust's
bonds. We also increased the trust's stake in health care, housing, airline and
airline facility issues.

Based on our view that interest rates would continue to rise, with longer-term
rates advancing less rapidly, we kept the trust's duration shorter than its
benchmark's. (Duration is a measure of interest rate sensitivity.) The trust
also

                                                                               3
<PAGE>

benefited from its emphasis on bonds with long maturities, which outperformed
bonds with shorter maturities. Our purchases favored bonds with maturities of 20
years and longer. In contrast, we sold intermediate- and short-term bonds with
maturities of 15 years and less. Short-term pre-refunded issues were also
included among our sales. Consistent with our quality-driven approach, 100
percent of bonds in the portfolio carried investment-grade ratings of BBB or
higher at the close of the period, while 72 percent were rated AA or higher. The
trust's portfolio was well-represented across the major sectors of the municipal
bond market. As of the close of the period, the trust's largest allocations were
to the general purpose, hospital, tobacco settlement, public transportation and
student housing sectors.

VTN's procedure for reinvesting all dividends and distributions in common shares
is through purchases in the open market. This method helps support the market
value of the Fund's shares. In addition, we would like to remind you that the
Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the Fund may, when appropriate,
purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at a
price not above market value or net asset value, whichever is lower at the time
of purchase.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the trust in
the future.

VAN KAMPEN TRUST FOR INVESTMENT GRADE NEW YORK MUNICIPALS

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Trust for Investment Grade New York Municipals (the "Trust") is
registered as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's
investment objective is to provide a high level of current income exempt from
federal as well as New York State and New York City income taxes, consistent
with preservation of capital. The Trust will invest substantially all of its
assets in New York municipal securities rated investment grade at the time of
investment, but may invest up to 20% of its assets in unrated securities which
are believed to be of comparable quality to those rated investment grade. The
Trust commenced investment operations on March 27, 1992.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION Municipal bonds are valued by independent pricing services
or dealers using the mean of the bid and asked prices or, in the absence of
market quotations, at fair value based upon yield data relating to municipal
bonds with similar characteristics and general market conditions. Securities
which are not valued by independent pricing services or dealers are valued at
fair value using procedures established in good faith by the Board of Trustees.
Futures contracts are valued at the settlement price established each day on the
exchange on which they are traded. Short-term securities with remaining
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates
market value.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Security transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis. The
Trust may purchase and sell securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery"
basis, with settlement to occur at a later date. The value of the security so
purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will
segregate assets with the custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to
the amount of the when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until
payment is made. At April 30, 2006, there were no when-issued and delayed
delivery purchase commitments.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Bond
premium is amortized and discount is accreted over the expected life of each
applicable security.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required.

    On October 28, 2005, the Trust acquired all of the assets and liabilities of
Van Kampen New York Quality Municipal Trust (ticker symbol VNM) and Van Kampen
New York Value Municipal Income Trust (ticker symbol VNV) through a tax free
reorganization approved by VNM and VNV shareholders on October 21, 2005. The
Trust issued 5,253,319 common shares and 1,800 Auction Preferred Shares (APS)
with a net asset value of $88,308,273 and liquidation value of $45,000,000,
respectively, in exchange for VNM's net assets. The Trust issued 4,017,876
common shares and 1,600 APS with a net asset value of $67,540,588 and
liquidation value of $40,000,000, respectively, in exchange for VNV's net
assets. The shares of VNM were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of
0.928864 to 1 and 1 to 1, for common shares and APS, respectively. The shares of
VNV were converted into Trust shares at a ratio of .936312 to 1 and 1 to 1, for
common shares and APS, respectively. Included in these net assets was a deferred
compensation and retirement plan balance of $486,347 which is included with
accumulated undistributed net investment income. Net unrealized appreciation of
VNM and VNV as of October 28, 2005 were $5,509,076 and $5,816,625, respectively.
The Trust assumed VNM and VNV's book to tax accretion differences, which
resulted in a $456,025 increase to accumulated undistributed net investment
income and a corresponding decrease to net unrealized appreciation. Combined net
assets applicable to common shares on the day of reorganization were
$260,233,331 and combined net assets including preferred shares were
$405,233,331, which included gains or losses of $565,780 recognized for tax
purposes on open future transactions at merger date of October 28, 2005. The
Trust incurred merger expenses of $153,900, which represent costs related to the
preparation, printing and distribution of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus,
Reorganization Agreement and registration statements as well as legal, audit and
filing fees.

4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the period, the cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investments,
excluding short-term investments, were $98,130,401 and $102,434,282,
respectively.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    In order to seek to manage the interest rate exposure of the Trust's
portfolio in a changing interest rate environment, the Trust may purchase or
sell financial futures contracts or engage in transactions involving interest
rate swaps, caps, floors or collars. The Trust expects to enter into these
transactions primarily as a hedge against anticipated interest rate or fixed
income market changes, for duration management or for risk management purposes,
but may also enter into these transactions to generate additional income. All of
the Trust's portfolio holdings, including derivative instruments, are marked to
market each day with the change in value reflected in the unrealized
appreciation/depreciation. Upon disposition, a realized gain or loss is
recognized accordingly, except when taking delivery of a security underlying a
futures contract. In this instance, the recognition of gain or loss is postponed
until the disposal of the security underlying the futures contract. Risks may
arise as a result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts.

    Summarized below are the specific types of derivative financial instruments
used by the Trust.

A. FUTURES CONTRACTS A futures contract is an arrangement involving the delivery
of a particular asset on a specified future date at an agreed upon price. The
Trust generally invests in exchange traded futures contracts on U.S. Treasury
securities and typically closes the contract prior to the delivery date. These
contracts are generally used to manage the Trust's effective maturity and
duration. Upon entering into futures contracts, the Trust maintains an amount of
cash or liquid securities with a value equal to a percentage of the contract
amount with either a futures commission merchant pursuant to the rules and
regulations promulgated under the 1940 Act, as amended, or with its custodian in
an account in the broker's name. This amount is known as initial margin. During
the period the futures contract is open, payments are received from or made to
the broker based upon changes in the value of the contract (the variation
margin). The risk of loss associated with a futures contract is in excess of the
variation margin reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

    Transactions in futures contracts for the six months ended April 30, 2006,
were as follows:

B. INTEREST RATE SWAPS The Trust may enter into interest rate swaps primarily to
preserve a return or spread on a particular investment or portion of its
portfolio, as a duration

                                                                              21

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- APRIL 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED) continued

management technique or to protect against any increase in the price of
securities the Trust anticipates purchasing at a later date. Interest rate swaps
are contractual agreements to exchange periodic interest payment streams
calculated on a predetermined notional principal amount. Interest rate swaps
generally involve one party paying a fixed interest rate and the other party
paying a variable rate. The Trust will usually enter into swaps on a net basis,
i.e., the two payment streams are netted out in a cash settlement on the payment
date or dates specified in the instrument, with the Trust receiving or paying,
as the case may be, only the net amount of the two payments. The Trust accrues
the net amount with respect to each swap on a daily basis. This net amount is
recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation on swap contracts. Upon
cash settlement of the periodic payments, the net amount is recorded as realized
gain/loss on swap contracts on the Statement of Operations. Risks may arise as a
result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of
their contracts. If there is a default by the counterparty, the Trust will have
contractual remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction.

C. INDEXED SECURITY An inverse floating rate security is one where the coupon is
inversely indexed to a short-term floating interest rate multiplied by a
specific factor. As the floating rate rises, the coupon is reduced. Conversely,
as the floating rate declines, the coupon is increased. The price of these
securities may be more volatile than the price of a comparable fixed rate
security. These instruments are typically used by the Trust to enhance the yield
of the portfolio. These instruments are identified in the Portfolio of
Investments.

6. PREFERRED SHARES

As of April 30, 2006, the Trust has outstanding 5,800 (APS). Series A contains
2,400 shares, Series B contains 1,800 shares and Series C contains 1,600 shares.
Dividends are cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every 28
days for Series A and B, while Series C is generally reset every 7 days through
an auction process. The average rate in effect on April 30, 2006 was 3.742%.
During the six months ended April 30, 2006, the rates ranged from 2.200% to
4.770%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

7. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.
