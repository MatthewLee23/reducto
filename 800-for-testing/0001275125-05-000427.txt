LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS

GLOBAL MARKET OVERVIEW
    Monetary policy remained very accommodative across the globe during the
period under review and much has been written about a global savings glut
pushing down long term rates. Economies from the emerging markets are
continuing to build foreign currency reserves. Their strong export growth is
generating income that cannot be fully reinvested in their domestic economies.
Because these countries' capital markets are not large enough at this stage of
their development to be the recipient of so much liquidity, their money is
being invested in government debt in Europe and the United States.

    As economic growth has cooled off since the beginning of the year, the
build up of excess liquidity described above also found its way into merger and
acquisitions financing. It has, in addition, facilitated the process of
bringing companies to the market. Initial public offerings in Europe reached
10,778 billion euros in the second quarter, an increase of 19% over the same
period the prior year. Mergers and acquisitions (especially in the food,
telecommunications and banking sectors) have also been significant since the
beginning of the year.

SWISS MARKET NEWS
    Switzerland has seen its share of consolidation and take-over attempts,
especially in the small capitalization segment of the market. Examples of
recent activity targeting Swiss companies were the Japanese Group Sumida making
a bid for Saia-Burgess; CVC Capital Partners, an electronic components
manufacturer, bidding for Forbo; and Hexagon, a floor covering producer,
bidding for Leica Geosystems, a manufacturer of surveying and mapping equipment.

    Victory, an Austrian investment company, has acquired a majority voting
stake in Unaxis, the Swiss semi-conductor and coating equipment company, and
replaced almost the entire board of directors. As expected, the Swiss Takeover
Commission ruled that Victory was not required to make a formal offer to
minority shareholders.

    The Swiss exchange announced the new composition of the large
capitalization companies index: Swiss Market Index (SMI) that will be active
starting October 1, 2005. The two main changes are the entry of Nobel Biocare,
which develops and produces dental implants, with a market capitalization of
6.7 billion Swiss francs and the exit of Unaxis. The total number of companies
in the SMI remains at 27.

SWISS ECONOMIC NOTES
    The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has kept the target range for the three-month
LIBOR rate unchanged at 0.25%-1.25% and intends to keep the rate in the middle
of the target range at around 0.75% for the time being. The SNB still expects
the economy to recover during the course of the year. However, it predicts a
lower growth rate for the year in comparison with its last assessment in March
(around 1% compared with 1.5%).

LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS (continued)

    Growth in the Swiss Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has declined from 2.1% in
June 2004 to 0.8% in March 2005. The KOF (Konjunkturforschungstelle) economic
barometer which indicates the development of year-to-year growth has been
showing a more pronounced downward movement, which indicates that the slowdown
in GDP growth is likely to persist throughout the next few months.

    The unemployment rate, on the other hand, seems to be improving. After
reaching 4% in December 2004, it has declined to 3.6% in June 2005.

    Yields on longer-term bonds (10 years), after regaining from mid-February
to the end of March, dropped until the beginning of June, reaching 1.955% by
the end of that month.

    The increase in the Consumer Price Index was 0.7% over the prior year, a
decrease from the March increase of 1.4%.

SWISS MARKET REVIEW AND FUND PERFORMANCE
    The Swiss market performed well during the first half of the year, with a
return for the broad index, the Swiss Performance Index (SPI), of 12.23% in
local currency. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar, however, reduced that
return to -0.94% for the U.S. investor. The dispersion of year-to-date returns
for the different industry groups was relatively low, with most sectors up
between 11% to 15% in local currency. Chemicals and banks were the weakest
sectors while basic materials and industrial cyclicals were the strongest.

    Small capitalization stocks (up 16.68% in local currency) outperformed mid
capitalization stocks (up 11.1%) which, in turn, outperformed large
capitalization stocks (up 10.6%). The Fund has a larger relative exposure to
mid capitalization stocks than to small capitalization ones. So far the Fund's
Management found more sustainable investment cases in the mid capitalization
companies universe. It has been more difficult to find growth stories in the
small capitalization area that are not too cyclical in nature. Management wants
to avoid Fund exposure to the liquidity risk involved in trying to exit a
position as fundamentals for a company are changing and the business risk of
the company itself.

    Among large capitalization stocks, one of the best performers was Roche
Holding AG, up 23% during the first half-year, which benefited from the
outstanding performance of Genentech's cancer drug portfolio (Roche owns 56% of
Genentech). ABB Ltd. was even stronger this year but it merely made up for the
ground it lost last year after disappointing results in its power division last
September and the lack of progress in its asbestos liability settlement. The
luxury sector came back strongly at the beginning of June on upgrades by
several analysts, the strength of the dollar, and strong Swiss watch export
numbers for the U.S. and Asia. Compagnie Financiere Richemont AG was the
strongest of the group. Zurich Financial Services AG (insurance) and Holcim
Ltd. (cement) also performed above the market. The technology sector was strong
as well

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS (continued)

with Kudelski SA (conditional access systems) up 12% and Logitech International
SA (computer input devices) up 18%.

    The Fund's performance of 10.17% in local currency lagged the SPI by 2.06%.
The Fund has an overweight position in the utility sector. This industry is
benefiting from continuous increase in electricity wholesale prices in Europe
and from its access to cheap producing capacity (hydro-power). In addition,
this is a very fragmented industry in Switzerland, be it at the production or
distribution level and consolidation is high on the agenda as Switzerland is
finally expected to move to a fully deregulated regime.

    The utility group was up 13.4% year-to-date but one of the investments of
the Fund (Elektrizitaets-Gesellschaft Laufenburg AG) in that sector
underperformed as regulatory environment changes reduced opportunity for
trading profit.

    This, with the Fund's light exposure to the luxury goods sector, was the
main reason why its performance lagged the Swiss market. At the beginning of
the year Management was concerned about the health of global consumer demand,
as economically sensitive stocks had a sharp correction and as bond yields made
new lows on fears of a global slowdown. The Fund has increased its exposure to
the luxury goods sector since then, as the market positions of Swiss companies
in Asia continued to strengthen, and as the dollar stayed strong, helped by
interest rate differentials and lower than expected public deficits.

    The Fund's cumulative performance continues to be superior to, and its near
term performance competitive with, its Swiss peers and its benchmark. As of
June 30, 2005, the Fund had a rating of three stars from Morningstar.*

*Morningstar is an independent fund performance monitor. Its ratings reflect
historic risk-adjusted performance and may change monthly. Its ratings of one
(low) and five (high) stars are based on a fund's three- and five-year average
annual total returns with fee adjustments, and a risk factor that reflects fund
performance relative to three-month Treasury Bill monthly returns. Only 33% of
the funds in an investment category may receive four or five stars. As of June
30, 2005, there were 95 funds in the Fund's asset category rated by Morningstar.

CURRENCY
    In separate referendum, voters in France and Holland rejected the European
Union (EU) constitution. Although we did not see any immediate material impact
on the bond market, the euro has certainly been weaker against the U.S. dollar.
Moreover, the Swiss franc and British pound have not really benefited from a
potential slowdown in EU reform and the apparent loosening of the Maastrich
criteria. Most likely, the economic situation in Euroland is influenced for now
more by the fate of the U.S. consumer and Asian producers than by events in
Europe.

    The recent strength of the U.S. dollar is mostly a positive factor for the
return of Swiss stocks in local currency. Companies like Nestle AG and Swiss
Reinsurance Company benefit as more than 50% of their sales are in U.S.
dollars, a level that is higher than their U.S. dollar costs. In addition, they
report financial results in Swiss francs.

LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS (continued)

    Novartis AG and Roche Holding AG have between 35% and 40% of sales in U.S.
currency, but their costs match those percentages more closely. In addition,
Novartis AG reports its financial results in U.S. dollars. Among companies that
could be penalized by the currency translation effect are Syngenta AG, and ABB
Ltd. as they report financial results in U.S. currency and have a substantial
percentage of sales outside the U.S.

OUTLOOK / STRATEGY
    The markets should remain caught between price multiple compression (due to
the end of the multi-year decline in interest rates) and the positive aspects
of low opportunity cost for holding stocks (bond yields are still low for now).
In the short-term, stock investors could benefit from a reacceleration of
earnings and expectations of approaching the end of the Federal Reserve Bank's
tightening of interest rates. In Switzerland, the retreat of the Swiss franc
should initiate a round of earnings upgrades.

    The Fund's Management believes there are still opportunities for growth in
the second tier of the market or increases in valuations and that the large
capitalization segment will benefit from favorable valuations, defensive
characteristics and the strength of the U.S. and Asian currencies.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
    Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market
purchases of its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 and has
continued purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock
repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net
asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect upon the
Fund's expense ratio and without realizing capital gains in order to fund the
repurchases. The Board has authorized the purchase of up to 250,000 shares in
2005. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, there were no shares
repurchased and retired by the Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)

NOTE 1--ORGANIZATIONAND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. ORGANIZATION
The Swiss Helvetia Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), as a non-diversified, closed-end
investment management company. The Fund is organized as a corporation under the
laws of the State of Delaware.
The investment objective of the Fund is to seek long-term growth of capital
through investment in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies.

B. VALUATION OF SECURITIES
The Fund values its investments at market value.

When valuing listed equity securities, the Fund uses the last sale price prior
to the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. When valuing equity
securities that are not listed or that are listed but have not traded, the Fund
uses the mean between the bid and asked prices for that day.

When valuing fixed income securities, the Fund uses the last bid price prior to
the calculation of the Fund's net asset value. If a current bid price is not
available, the Fund uses the mean between the latest quoted bid and asked
prices. When valuing fixed income securities that mature within sixty days, the
Fund uses amortized cost.

It is the responsibility of the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board") to
establish fair valuation procedures. When valuing securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or for which the market quotations that
are available are considered unreliable, the Fund determines a fair value in
good faith in accordance with these procedures. The Fund may use these
procedures to establish the fair value of securities when, for example, a
significant event occurs between the time the market closes and the time the
Fund values its investments. After consideration of various factors, the Fund
may value the securities at their last reported price or at some other value.
On June 30, 2005, there were no fair valued securities.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses are determined by comparing the proceeds of a sale or the cost of a
purchase with a specific offsetting transaction.

Dividend income, net of any foreign taxes withheld, is recorded on the
ex-dividend date. Interest income, including amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts, is accrued daily. Estimated expenses are also accrued
daily.

The Fund records Swiss withholding tax as an expense, net of any amount
receivable from Swiss tax authorities in accordance with the tax treaty between
the United States and Switzerland.

D. DISTRIBUTIONS
The Fund pays dividends annually to the extent it has any net investment income
and net realized gains from foreign currency transactions and makes
distributions of any net realized capital gains to the extent they exceed any
capital loss carryforwards. The Fund determines the size and nature of these
distributions in accordance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Distributions may be paid either in cash or in stock with an option to take
cash. The Fund records dividends and distributions on its books on the
ex-dividend date.

E. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and
to distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Therefore, no federal
income tax provision is required.

Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles.

F. SECURITIES LENDING INCOME
The Fund may lend securities to financial institutions. The Fund retains
beneficial ownership of the securities it has loaned and continues to
participate in any changes in their market value.

Although the Fund is entitled to receive amounts equivalent to any dividends
paid on securities while they are on loan, these amounts do not receive the
favorable tax treatment accorded to dividends received from the company itself.
Accordingly, the Fund does not lend securities on the ex-date of the dividend.

                                      18
<PAGE>
                         THE SWISS HELVETIA FUND, INC.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (continued)

For the initial transaction, the Fund requires the borrowers of the securities
to establish collateral with the Fund in the form of cash and/or government
securities equal to 105% of the value of the securities loaned. Subsequent to
the initial transaction, the Fund requires the borrowers to maintain collateral
with the Fund equal to 100% of the value of the securities loaned. The Fund
receives fees as compensation for lending its securities. Either the Fund or
the borrower may terminate the securities loan at any time. On June 30, 2005,
there were no securities on loan.

G. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
The Fund maintains its accounting records in U.S. dollars. The Fund determines
the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and
transactions by using prevailing exchange rates. In valuing assets and
liabilities, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the valuation date.
In valuing securities transactions, the receipt of income and the payment of
expenses, the Fund uses the prevailing exchange rate on the transaction date.

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translations
shown on the Fund's financial statements result from the sale of foreign
currencies, from currency gains or losses realized between the trade and
settlement dates on securities transactions, and from the difference between
the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes recorded on
the Fund's books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually
received or paid.

When calculating realized and unrealized gains or losses on investments in
equity securities, the Fund does not separate the gain or loss attributable to
changes in the foreign currency price of the security from the gain or loss
attributable to the change in the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency.
Other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain
(loss) are disclosed separately.

H. ESTIMATES
In preparing its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, management makes estimates and
assumptions. Actual results may be different.

NOTE 2--FEES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
Hottinger Capital Corp. ("HCC"), which is owned jointly by Hottinger U.S., Inc.
and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich), is the Fund's advisor (the "Advisor"). The Fund
pays the Advisor an annual fee based on its month-end net assets which is
calculated and paid monthly at the following annual rates: 1.00% of the first
$60 million, 0.90% of the next $40 million, 0.80% of the next $100 million,
0.70% of the next $100 million, 0.65% of the next $100 million, 0.60% of the
next $100 million, 0.55% of the next $100 million, and 0.50% of such assets in
excess of $600 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2005, the Fund paid
the Advisor $1,565,867 in investment advisory fees. The Fund paid Hottinger &
Cie $46,760 in brokerage commissions for the six months ended June 30, 2005.

The Fund and the Advisor have agreed to share certain common expenses subject
to review by the audit committee of the Board. As of June 30, 2005, the Fund
and the Advisor each paid half of $10,676 of expenses incurred in connection
with publicizing the Fund.

Certain officers and directors of the Fund are also officers or directors of
HCC, Hottinger U.S., Inc. and Hottinger & Cie (Zurich). These persons are not
paid by the Fund for serving in these capacities.

NOTE 3--OTHER FEES
Citigroup Fund Services, LLC ("Citigroup") provides certain administration and
portfolio accounting services to the Fund.

American Stock Transfer & Trust Company is the Fund's transfer agent. The Fund
pays the transfer agent an annual fee which is accrued daily and paid monthly.

Swiss American Securities Inc. is the Fund's U.S. custodian. Credit Suisse
First Boston is the Fund's Swiss sub-custodian. The Fund pays the custodian and
sub-custodian an annual fee.

The Fund pays each director who is not an interested person (as such term is
defined in the Act) of the Fund, its Advisor, or Citigroup, approximately
$16,400 per annum in compensation, except for the Chairmen of the Audit
Committee and the Governance/Nominating Committee, to whom the Fund pays an
annual fee of approximately $18,000. In addition, the Fund pays each
disinterested director $750 for each Board meeting attended and $750 for each
committee meeting attended, if it

than short-term obligations, for the six months ended June 30, 2005, were
$86,508,191 and $100,327,982, respectively.

NOTE 6--STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
Pursuant to authorization by the Board, the Fund began open market purchases of
its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 and has continued
purchases in each subsequent year. The principal purpose of the stock
repurchase program is to enhance stockholder value by increasing the Fund's net
asset value per share without creating a meaningful adverse effect upon the
Fund's expense ratio and without realizing capital gains in order to fund the
repurchases. The Board has authorized the purchase of up to 250,000 shares in
2005. During the six months ended June 30, 2005, there were no shares
repurchased and retired by the Fund.

NOTE 7--PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

NOTE 9--ADVISORY AGREEMENT APPROVAL
At the March 17, 2005 meeting of the Board, the Board, including the
Independent Directors, considered the approval of the Investment Advisory
Agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with the Advisor. In evaluating the
Advisory Agreement, the Board considered the following information: (1) the
Fund's performance, (2) the Fund's expenses (including the fees paid to the
Advisor for its services), (3) the nature, extent and quality of the services
the Advisor provided to the Fund, (4) the financial position and profitability
of the Advisor, (5) the extent to which any economies of scale are realized as
the Fund grows and whether the fee level reflects these economies of scale for
the benefit of the Fund's investors, and (6) other benefits that the Advisor or
its parent derived from managing

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) (concluded)

the Fund. The Advisory Agreement was approved by stockholders of the Fund at
the annual meeting held on May 26, 2005.

The Board discussed the Fund's performance and expenses. The Independent
Directors reviewed the Fund's investment performance, determining that the
relevant measures should be in terms of its net asset value as measured in
Swiss francs since the Fund's portfolio securities and cash were denominated in
Swiss francs and since, as a matter of policy, the Fund did not hedge its
currency exposure. Based on this determination, the Independent Directors
compared the Fund's one and three year investment performance, as well as its
longer term performance, with the performance of the Swiss Performance Index
(SPI), the performance of the Swiss iShares traded on the New York Stock
Exchange, and the performance of a peer group of equity investment funds of
comparable or larger size that were managed by Swiss advisers with publicly
available performance information. The Independent Directors, in comparing the
Fund's performance with the performance of the SPI, took into consideration the
fact that, unlike the Fund, the performance of the SPI did not include the
impact of any expenses. The Independent Directors concluded that the Fund's
one-year (ended December 31, 2004), three-year and longer-term returns had
outperformed all of the above comparisons.

The Board also discussed the difference in the management fee charged to the
Fund and the fee charged to other U.S. regulated closed-end European country
funds as well as a peer group of similar equity funds actively managed by other
Swiss advisers. The Board noted the Advisor's fees were the lowest in each
group even after combining them with the 7 basis point administration fees paid
to a third party administrator to the Fund. The Independent Directors also
determined that the combined investment advisory fee and administration fee was
also lower than the fees the Advisor's parent charged to its private advisory
clients and to a Luxembourg fund it managed with comparable portfolios. The
Independent Directors separately considered the fees charged by the Advisor,
including the breakpoints at various asset levels, noting that the breakpoints
(which were voluntarily adjusted by the Advisor in 1995 to benefit the Fund)
allowed the Fund to share in economies of scale with its growth in assets.

The Board then reviewed the Advisor's financial condition concluding that
although the advisory fees comprised the bulk of its income, its financial
condition was sound. The Board then considered information provided by the
Advisor regarding its profitability with respect to the Fund and noted that its
profitability was reasonable for the services it provided. The Board also
considered other benefits that the Advisor and its parent derived from their
relationship with the Fund, including (1) limited brokerage commissions from
executing Fund transactions, (2) the marketing value of the Fund's performance
in attracting other clients, and (3) the cost benefits to the Advisor of soft
dollar research and portfolio and financial information services. Based on this
review, the Independent Directors determined that these benefits were
relatively minor and did not affect their overall assessment of the
reasonableness of the relationship.

The Board then evaluated (1) the nature of the investment product, (2) the
creativity of the Advisor in developing the Fund's investment strategies and
the complexity of the Fund's securities market, (3) the highly professional
services provided by the Advisor to the Fund, (4) the qualifications and number
of Advisor personnel and the continuity of its personnel over time, and (5) the
availability of company research and market and financial information from the
Advisor's parent in Switzerland and determined that these were all desirable
factors.

Prior to voting, the Board reviewed a memorandum from counsel discussing the
legal standards for its consideration of the Advisory Agreement. While the
Independent Directors did not identify any single factor as controlling, the
Independent Directors, after considering all the factors, concluded that the
approval of the Advisory Agreement was reasonable, fair and in the best
interests of the Fund and its shareholders.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (Unaudited)

THE PLAN
The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers a convenient way for
you to reinvest capital gains distributions and ordinary income dividends,
payable in whole or in part in cash, in additional shares of the Fund.

Some of the Plan features are:
   . Once you enroll in the Plan, all of your future distributions and
     dividends payable in whole or in part in cash will be automatically
     reinvested in Fund shares in accordance with the terms of the Plan.
   . You will receive shares valued at the lower of the Fund's net asset value
     or the Fund's market price as described below. The entire amount of your
     distribution or dividend will be reinvested automatically in additional
     Fund shares. For any balance that is insufficient to purchase full shares
     of the Fund, your account will be credited with fractional shares.
   . Your shares will be held in an account with the Plan agent. You will be
     sent regular statements for your records.
   . You may terminate participation in the Plan at any time.

   The following are answers to frequently asked questions about the Plan.

HOW DO I ENROLL IN THE PLAN?
If you are holding certificates for your shares, contact American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company (AST) at the address shown below. If your shares are
held in a brokerage account, contact your broker. Not all brokerage firms
permit their clients to participate in dividend reinvestment plans such as the
Plan and, even if your brokerage firm does permit participation, you may not be
able to transfer your Plan shares to another broker who does not permit
participation. Your brokerage firm will be able to advise you about its
policies.

HOW DOES THE PLAN WORK?
The cash portion of any dividends or distributions you receive, payable in
whole or in part in cash, will be reinvested in shares of the Fund. The number
of shares credited to your Plan account as a result of the reinvestment will
depend upon the relationship between the Fund's market price and its net asset
value per share on the record date of the distribution or dividend, as
described below:

   . If the net asset value is greater than the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a discount), AST, as Plan Agent, will buy Fund shares for your
     account on the open market on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere.
     Your dividends or distributions will be reinvested at the average price
     AST pays for those purchases.
   . If the net asset value is equal to the market price (the Fund is trading
     at parity), the Fund will issue for your account new shares at net asset
     value.
   . If the net asset value is less than but within 95% of the market price
     (the Fund is trading at a premium of less than 5%), the Fund will issue
     for your account new shares at net asset value.
   . If the net asset value is less than 95% of the market price (the Fund is
     trading at a premium of 5% or more), the Fund will issue for your account
     new shares at 95% of the market price.

If AST begins to buy Fund shares for your account at a discount to net asset

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN (Unaudited) (concluded)

ue, AST will complete its purchases, even though the result may be that the
average price paid for the purchases exceeds net asset value.

WILL THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF MY DISTRIBUTION OR DIVIDEND BE REINVESTED?
The entire amount of your distribution or dividend, payable in cash, will be
reinvested in additional Fund shares. If a balance remains after the purchase
of whole shares, your account will be credited with any fractional shares
(rounded to three decimal places) necessary to complete the reinvestment.

HOW CAN I SELL MY SHARES?
You can sell any or all of the shares in your Plan account by contacting AST.
AST charges $15 for the transaction plus $.10 per share for this service. You
can also withdraw your shares from your Plan account and sell them through your
broker.

DOES PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN CHANGE THE TAX STATUS OF MY DISTRIBUTIONS OR
DIVIDENDS?
No. The distributions and dividends are paid in cash and their taxability is
the same as if you received the cash. It is only after the payment of
distributions and dividends that AST reinvests the cash for your account.

CAN I GET CERTIFICATES FOR THE SHARES IN THE PLAN?
AST will issue certificates for whole shares upon your request. Certificates
for fractional shares will not be issued.

IS THERE ANY CHARGE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PLAN?
There is no charge to participate in the Plan. You will, however, pay a pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to AST's open market
purchases of shares for your Plan account.

HOW CAN I DISCONTINUE MY PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN?
Contact your broker or AST in writing. If your shares are in a Plan account,
AST will send you a certificate for your whole shares and a check for any
fractional shares.

WHERE CAN I DIRECT MY QUESTIONS AND CORRESPONDENCE?
