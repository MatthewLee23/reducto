(1) Inclusive of net assets attributable to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value and
dividing the remainder by the initial investment and expressing the result as a
percentage. The calculation assumes that all income dividends and capital gain
distributions by the Fund have been reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not reflect
broker commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period greater than one
year represents the average annual total return.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the current annualized per
share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share.

(1) Inclusive of net assets to attributable Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value and
dividing the remainder by the initial investment and expressing the result as a
percentage. The calculation assumes that all income dividends and capital gain
distributions by the Fund have been reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not reflect
broker commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period greater than one
year represents the average annual total return.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the current annualized per
share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share.

(1) Inclusive of net assets to Preferred Shares outstanding.

(2) PAST PERFORMANCE IS NO GUARANTEE OF FUTURE RESULTS. Total return is
determined by subtracting the initial investment from the redeemable value and
dividing the remainder by the initial investment and expressing the result as a
percentage. The calculation assumes that all income dividends and capital gain
distributions by the Fund have been reinvested at prices obtained under the
Fund's dividend reinvestment plan. Total investment return does not reflect
broker commissions or sales charges. Total return for a period greater than one
year represents the average annual total return.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the loss of principal.
Investment return, price, yield and net asset value will fluctuate with changes
in market conditions. This data is provided for information only and is not
intended for trading purposes. A portion of the income generated by the Fund may
be subject to federal, state and local taxes, and may at times be subject to the
alternative minimum tax. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not
continuously offered. There is a one-time public offering and once issued,
shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange.
Net asset value is total assets applicable to common shareholders less total
liabilities divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Holdings are
subject to change daily.

(3) Market Price Yield is determined by dividing the current annualized per
share dividend to common shareholders by the market price per common share.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2003


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
PIMCO Municipal Income Fund ("Municipal"), PIMCO California Municipal Income
Fund ("California Municipal") and PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund ("New
York Municipal"), collectively referred to as the "Funds", were organized as
Massachusetts business trusts on May 10, 2001. Prior to commencing operations
on June 29, 2001, the Funds had no operations other than matters relating to
their organization and registration as non-diversified, closed-end management
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
the rules and regulations thereunder, as amended, and the sale and issuance of
6,667 shares of beneficial interest of each Fund at an aggregate purchase price
of $100,005 per Fund to Allianz Dresdner Asset Management of America L.P.,
("ADAM"). PIMCO Advisors Fund Management LLC (the "Investment Manager"),
formerly PIMCO Funds Advisors LLC, serves as the Fund's Investment Manager and
is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of ADAM. ADAM is an indirect
majority-owned subsidiary of Allianz AG. The Funds have an unlimited amount of
no par value common stock authorized.

Municipal, California Municipal and New York Municipal issued 20,600,000,
15,200,000 and 6,200,000 shares of common stock, respectively, in their initial
public offerings. An additional 3,090,000, 2,280,000 and 930,000 shares of
Municipal, California Municipal and New York Municipal, respectively, were
issued in connection with the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment
option on June 26, 2001. These shares were all issued at $15.00 per share
before an underwriting discount of $0.675 per share. Offering costs of
$710,700, $524,400 and $213,900 (representing $0.03 per share for each Fund),
for Municipal, California Municipal and New York Municipal, respectively, were
offset against the proceeds of the offerings and have been charged to paid-in
capital. The Investment Manager has paid all offering costs (other than the
sales load) and organizational expenses exceeding $0.03 per share for each
Fund.

In addition, the underwriters commission and offering costs associated with the
Funds' issuance of Preferred Shares in the amounts of $2,000,000 and $335,000,
$1,500,000 and $364,023 and $630,000 and $205,414, for Municipal, California
Municipal and New York Municipal, respectively, have been charged to paid-in
capital.

The preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. In the normal course of business the Funds enter into
contracts that contain a variety of representations which provide general
indemnifications. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds
that have not yet occurred. However, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be
remote.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds:

(a) VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS
Debt securities are valued daily by an independent pricing service approved by
the Boards of Trustees. Any security or other asset for which market quotations
are not readily available is valued at fair value as determined in good faith
under procedures established by the Boards of Trustees. Municipal invests
substantially all of its assets in a portfolio of municipal bonds, the interest
from which is exempt from federal income taxes. California Municipal invests
substantially all of its assets in municipal bonds which pay interest that is
exempt from federal and California State income taxes. New York Municipal
invests substantially all of its assets in municipal bonds which pay interest
that is exempt from federal, New York State and New York City income taxes. The
Funds seek to avoid bonds generating interest income which could potentially
subject individuals to alternative minimum tax. The issuers' abilities to meet
their obligations may be affected by economic and political developments in a
specific state or region.

(b) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Funds intend to distribute all of their taxable income and to comply with
the other requirements of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
applicable to regulated investment companies. Accordingly, no provision for
U.S. federal income taxes is required. In addition, by distributing
substantially all of their taxable ordinary income and long-term capital gains,
if any, during each calendar year, the Funds intend not to be subject to U.S.
federal excise tax.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
April 30, 2003

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
(c) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME
Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses on investments are determined on the identified cost basis. Interest
income is recorded on an accrual basis. Original issue discounts or premiums on
debt securities purchased are accreted or amortized daily to non-taxable
interest income. Market discount, if any, is accreted daily to taxable income.


(d) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS -- COMMON STOCK
The Funds declare dividends from net investment income monthly to common
shareholders. Distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, are paid at
least annually. Each Fund records dividends and distributions to its
shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The amount of dividends and distributions
from net investment income and net realized capital gains are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
accepted accounting principles. These "book-tax" differences are either
considered temporary or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences
are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts based on their federal income tax treatment; temporary differences do
not require reclassification. To the extent dividends and/or distributions
exceed current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax
purposes, they are reported as dividends and/or distributions of paid-in
capital.


(e) EXPENSE OFFSET
The Funds benefit from an expense offset arrangement with their custodian bank
whereby uninvested cash balances earn credits which reduce monthly custodian
and accounting agent expenses. Had these cash balances been invested in income
producing securities, they would have generated income for the Funds.


(f) FUTURES CONTRACTS
A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to buy and sell a
financial instrument at a set price on a future date. Upon entering into such a
contract, the Funds are required to pledge to the broker an amount of cash or
securities equal to the minimum "initial margin" requirements of the exchange.
Pursuant to the contracts, the Funds agree to receive from or pay to the broker
an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in the value of the contracts.
Such receipts or payments are known as "variation margin" and are recorded by
the Funds as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. When the contracts are
closed, the Funds record a realized gain or loss equal to the difference
between the value of the contracts at the time they were opened and the value
at the time they were closed. Any unrealized appreciation or depreciation
recorded is simultaneously reversed. Futures transactions involve the risk of
an imperfect correlation in the movements in the price of futures contracts,
interest rates and the underlying hedged assets, and the possible inability of
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.

Futures contracts outstanding at April 30, 2003 were as follows:

(g) OPTION TRANSACTIONS
For hedging purposes, the Funds may purchase and write (sell) put and call
options on Municipal Bonds, U.S. government securities, swap agreements,
indexes or futures contracts which are standardized and traded on a U.S. or
other exchange, boards of trade, or similar entity, or quoted on an automated
quotation system. The risk associated with purchasing an option is that the
Funds pay a premium whether or not the option is exercised. Additionally, the
Funds bear the risk of loss of premium and change in market value should the
counterparty not perform under the contract. Put and call options purchased are
accounted for in the same manner as portfolio securities.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONCLUDED)
(g) OPTION TRANSACTIONS (CONCLUDED)
The cost of securities acquired through the exercise of call options is
increased by the premiums paid. The proceeds from the securities sold through
the exercise of put options is decreased by the premiums paid.

When an option is written, the premium received is recorded as an asset with an
equal liability which is subsequently adjusted to the current market value of
the option written. Premiums received from writing options which expire
unexercised are recorded on the expiration date as a realized gain. The
difference between the premium received and the amount paid on effecting a
closing purchase transaction, including brokerage commissions, is also treated
as a realized gain, or if the premium is less than the amount paid for the
closing purchase transactions, as a realized loss. If a call option is
exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds from the sale of the underlying
security in determining whether there has been a realized gain or loss. If a
put option is exercised, the premium reduces the cost basis of the security. In
writing an option, the Funds bear the market risk of an unfavorable change in
the price of the security underlying the written option. Exercise of an option
written could result in the Funds purchasing a security at a price different
from the current market price.

Transactions in options written for the year ended April 30, 2003 were:

2. INVESTMENT MANAGER AND SUB-ADVISER
Each Fund has entered into an Investment Management Agreement (the
"Agreements") with the Investment Manager to serve as Investment Manager to
each Fund. Subject to the supervision of each Fund's Board of Trustees, the
Investment Manager is responsible for managing, either directly or through
others selected by it, the investment activities of each Fund and each Fund's
business affairs and other administrative matters. Pursuant to the Agreements,
the Investment Manager will receive an annual fee, payable monthly, at the
annual rate of 0.65% of each Fund's average daily net assets (including net
assets attributable to any preferred shares that may be outstanding). In order
to reduce Fund expenses, the Investment Manager has contractually agreed to
reimburse each Fund for fees and expenses at the annual rate of 0.20% of the
Fund's average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any
preferred shares that may be outstanding) from the commencement of operations
through June 30, 2006, and for a declining amount thereafter through June 30,
2009.

The Investment Manager has retained its affiliate, Pacific Investment
Management Company LLC (the "Sub-Adviser"), to manage each Fund's investments.
Subject to the supervision of the Investment Manager, the Sub-Adviser makes all
investment decisions with respect to each Fund's assets. The Investment Manager
(not the Funds) pays a portion of the fees it receives to the Sub-Adviser in
return for its services, at the maximum annual rate of 0.37% of each Fund's
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any preferred
shares that may be outstanding). The Sub-Adviser has contractually agreed to
waive a portion of the fees it is entitled to receive from the Investment
Manager, such that the Sub-Adviser will receive 0.25% of each Fund's average
daily net assets (including net assets attributable to any preferred shares
that may be outstanding) from the commencement of the Funds' operations through
June 30, 2006, and will receive an increasing amount (not to exceed 0.37% of
each Fund's average daily

value.

Preferred Shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, generally vote with

(1)  Total investment return is calculated assuming a purchase of common stock
     at the current market price on the first day and a sale at the current
     market price on the last day of each period reported. Dividends and

     reinvested at prices obtained under the Funds' dividend reinvestment plan.

     charges. Total investment return for a period of less than one year is not
     annualized.

     and preferred shares relative to the average net assets of common
     shareholders.

(3)  Inclusive of expenses offset by earning credits from custodian bank. (See
     note 1(e) in Notes to Financial Statements).

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS



To the Shareholders and Board of Trustees of:
PIMCO Municipal Income Fund, PIMCO California Municipal Income Fund and
PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund




In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities,
including the schedules of investments, and the related statements of
operations and of changes in net assets applicable to common shareholders and
the financial highlights present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of each of PIMCO Municipal Income Fund, PIMCO California
Municipal Income Fund and PIMCO New York Municipal Income Fund (collectively
hereafter referred to as the "Funds") at April 30, 2003, the results of each of
their operations for the year then ended, and the changes in each of their net
assets applicable to common shareholders and the financial highlights for the
year then ended and for the period June 29, 2001 (commencement of operations)
through April 30, 2002, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Funds' management; our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these financial statements in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America, which require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at April 30, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS TAX INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, requires the
Funds to advise shareholders within 60 days of the Funds' tax year end (April
30, 2003) as to the federal tax status of dividends and distributions received
by shareholders during such tax period. Accordingly, please note that
substantially all dividends paid from net investment income from the Funds
during the tax period ended April 30, 2003 were federally exempt interest
dividends. Although these Funds invested in municipal bonds containing market
discount, whose accretion is taxable. Accordingly, the percentage of dividends
paid from net investment income during the tax period which are taxable were:

Municipal                                              1.57%
California Municipal                                   2.17%
New York Municipal                                     0.38%

Per share dividends for the tax period ended April 30, 2003 were as follows:

Municipal:
- ----------
  Dividends to common shareholders from net investment income        $0.9750
  Dividends to preferred shareholders from net investment income      $287.473
  Distributions to common shareholders from net realized gains        $0.03783
  Distributions to preferred shareholders from net realized gains     $14.27

California Municipal:
- ---------------------
  Dividends to common shareholders from net investment income         $0.924
  Dividends to preferred shareholders from net investment income      $286.052

New York Municipal:
- -------------------
  Dividends to  common shareholders from net investment income        $0.75
  Dividends to preferred shareholders from net investment income      $225.244

Since the Funds' fiscal year is not the calendar year, another notification
will be sent with respect to calendar year 2003. In January 2004, you will be
advised on IRS Form 1099 DIV as to the federal tax status of the dividends and
distributions received during calendar year 2003. The amount that will be
reported, will be the amount to use on your 2003 federal income tax return and
may differ from the amount which must be reported in connection with each
Fund's tax year ended April 30, 2003. Shareholders are advised to consult with
their tax advisers as to the federal, state and local tax status of the income
received from the Funds. In January 2004, an allocation of interest by state
will be provided which may be of value in reducing a shareholder's state or
local tax liability, if any.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), all Common
Shareholders whose shares are registered in their own names will have all
dividends, including any capital gain dividends, reinvested automatically in
additional Common Shares by PFPC Inc., as agent for the Common Shareholders
(the "Plan Agent"), unless the shareholder elects to receive cash. An election
to receive cash may be revoked or reinstated at the option of the shareholder.
In the case of record shareholders such as banks, brokers or other nominees
that hold Common Shares for others who are the beneficial owners, the Plan
Agent will administer the Plan on the basis of the number of Common Shares
certified from time to time by the record shareholder as representing the total
amount registered in such shareholder's name and held for the account of
beneficial owners who are to participate in the Plan. Shareholders whose shares
are held in the name of a bank, broker or nominee should contact the bank,
whose broker or nominee elects not to participate on the investor's behalf),
will be paid in cash by check mailed, in the case of direct shareholder, to the
record holder by PFPC Inc., as the Fund's dividend disbursement agent.

Unless you (or your broker or nominee) elects not to participate in the Plan,
the number of Common Shares you will receive will be determined as follows:

(1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value on the payment
      date, the Fund will issue new shares at the greater of (i) the net asset
      value per Common Share on the payment date or (ii) 95% of the market
      price per Common Share on the payment date; or

(2)   If Common Shares are trading below net asset value (minus estimated
      brokerage commissions that would be incurred upon the purchase of Common
      Shares on the open market) on the payment date, the Plan Agent will
      receive the dividend or distribution in cash and will purchase Common
      Shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere,
      for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the market price for
      the Common Shares may increase before the Plan Agent has completed its
      purchases. Therefore, the average purchase price per share paid by the
      Plan Agent may exceed the market price on the payment date, resulting in
      the purchase of fewer shares than if the dividend or distribution had
      been paid in Common Shares issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use
      all dividends and distributions received in cash to purchase Common
      Shares in the open market on or shortly after the payment date, but in no
      event later than the ex-dividend date for the next distribution. Interest
      will not be paid on any uninvested cash payments.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving notice to the Plan Agent.
If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a certificate for
each whole share in your account under the Plan and you will receive a cash
payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish, the Plan
Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. The Plan Agent will also furnish each person who
buys Common Shares with written instructions detailing the procedures for
electing not to participate in the Plan and to instead receive distributions in
cash. Common Shares in your account will be held by the Plan Agent in
non-certificated form. Any proxy you receive will include all Common Shares you
have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or
distributions in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata
share of brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open
market purchases.

Automatically reinvested dividends and distributions are taxed in the same
manner as cash dividends and distributions.

The Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to amend or terminate the Plan.
There is no direct service charge to participants in the Plan; however, the
Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge payable
by the participants. Additional information about the Plan may be obtained from
PFPC Inc., 400 Belleview Parkway, Wilmington, DE 19809, telephone number
1-800-331-1710.

PIMCO MUNICIPAL INCOME FUNDS PRIVACY POLICY


OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU
We consider customer privacy to be a fundamental aspect of our relationship
with clients. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity,
and security of our current, prospective and former clients' personal
information. We have developed policies designed to protect this
confidentiality, while allowing client needs to be served.


OBTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION
In the course of providing you with products and services, we may obtain
non-public personal information about you. This information may come from
sources such as account applications and other forms, from other written,
electronic or verbal correspondence, from your transactions, from your
brokerage or financial advisory firm, financial adviser or consultant, and/or
from information captured on our internet web sites.


RESPECTING YOUR PRIVACY
We do not disclose any personal or account information provided by you or
gathered by us to non-affiliated third parties, except as required or permitted
by law. As is common in the industry, non-affiliated companies may from time to
time be used to provide certain services, such as preparing and mailing
prospectuses, reports, account statements and other information, conducting
research on client satisfaction, and gathering shareholder proxies. We may also
retain non-affiliated companies to market our products and enter in joint
marketing agreements with other companies. These companies may have access to
your personal and account information, but are permitted to use the information
solely to provide the specific service or as otherwise permitted by law. We may
also provide your personal and account information to your brokerage or
financial advisory firm and/or to your financial adviser or consultant.


SHARING INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
We do reserve the right to disclose or report personal information to
non-affiliated third parties in limited circumstances where we believe in good
faith that disclosure is required under law, to cooperate with regulators or
law enforcement authorities, to protect our rights or property, or upon
reasonable request by any mutual fund in which you have chosen to invest. In
addition, we may disclose information about you or your accounts to a
non-affiliated third party at your request or if you consent in writing to the
disclosure.


SHARING INFORMATION WITH AFFILIATES
We may share client information with our affiliates in connection with
servicing your account or to provide you with information about products and
services that we believe may be of interest to you. The information we share
may include, for example, your participation in our mutual funds or other
investment programs, your ownership of certain types of accounts (such as
IRAs), or other data about your accounts. Our affiliates, in turn, are not
permitted to share your information with non-affiliated entities, except as
required or permitted by law.


IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCEDURES
We take seriously the obligation to safeguard your non-public personal
information. We have implemented procedures designed to restrict access to your
non-public personal information to our personnel who need to know that
information to provide products or services to you. To guard your non-public
personal information, physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards are in
place.
