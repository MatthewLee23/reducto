Dear Fellow Shareholder:

The value of Putnam Premier Income Trust's strategy of diversification
that we have noted in previous reports was demonstrated once again for
the full fiscal year that ended on July 31, 2003. The fund's performance
was driven by two significant trends during the period. Early in the
year, falling interest rates and a preference for higher-quality bonds
boosted prices among the fund's investment-grade holdings. The second
trend, which began in mid-October 2002, was an improving credit cycle.
This helped the fund's higher-yielding, lower-quality holdings
outperform. Management's decision to increase the fund's exposure to
this segment of the market early in the cycle contributed to strong
results.

The fund's exposure to lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds was less than
that of its peer group, dampening the fund's results versus its Lipper
category average. You will find the details on the facing page. As far
as we are concerned, however, the relative stability provided by this
mix of quality and opportunity is a worthwhile tradeoff over the long
term.

Meanwhile, it is heartening now to see signs that one of the most
challenging periods in recent investment history may at last be ending.
What we told you at the beginning of this fiscal year bears repeating
here. We deeply appreciate your continued confidence in Putnam and we
firmly believe that over the long haul your patience will be rewarded.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL                   /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                       George Putnam, III

Report from Fund Management


Fund highlights

* Putnam Premier Income Trust had a total return of 17.61% at net asset
  value for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2003. The fund's return at
  market price was 13.41%.

* Declining yields across all fixed-income sectors prompted management
  to recommend a reduction in the fund's dividend, which occurred in
  April 2003.

* Differences in portfolio composition caused the fund to underperform
  the average return for the Lipper Flexible Income Funds (Closed-End)
  category, which was 18.88%.

* The fund's strategy of investing in high-yield corporate and
  emerging-market debt helped it to significantly outperform its
  benchmark, the Lehman Government Bond Index, which returned 4.45%
  during the fund's fiscal year. Additional comparisons, many of which
  more closely track the fund's performance over this period, appear on
  page 2.

* See the Performance Summary on page 8 for complete fund performance,
  comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

The fund's robust total return and solid comparative results versus its
benchmark were due primarily to its emphasis on higher-yielding,
lower-rated bonds -- such  as U.S. high-yield corporate bonds as well as
sovereign debt issued by emerging-market countries -- while limiting
exposure to investment-grade bonds during the period. Higher-yielding,
lower-rated fixed-income sectors turned in exceptionally strong results
from mid-October 2002 through period end, significantly outperforming
higher-rated debt as investors' appetite for higher-risk asset classes
returned. We attribute the fund's modest underperformance versus its
Lipper universe to lower weightings in these riskier asset categories
than the average fund in the peer group. The fund's exposure to foreign
government bonds also contributed positively to results. The fund's
lower performance at market price is attributable to reduced investor
demand following the April dividend reduction.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Premier Income Trust is designed for investors seeking a high
level of current income. The fund maintains flexibility across three
sectors -- U.S. government and agencies, high-yield corporate, and
international -- to seek maximum current income without undue risk  to
capital. The fund may be appropriate for investors seeking a higher
level of income who can accept a moderately higher level of risk.


Market overview

The fund's fiscal year results should be considered in the context of an
extraordinarily favorable environment for bond performance across all
sectors. The war in Iraq, SARS-related fears, and a negative economic
climate drove bond yields to historic lows worldwide, significantly
driving up bond prices, which move in the opposite direction to yields.
Governments and central banks redoubled their efforts to revitalize the
sluggish global economy with additional fiscal and monetary easing,
which improved investor morale.

Supported by investor demand for yield and improving issuer
fundamentals, corporate bonds led the investment-grade market during the
period, after a dismal performance in the second half of 2002. The
securitized sector, which includes various types of mortgage-backed
securities (e.g. Ginnie Maes), as well as asset-backed securities
(ABSs), also advanced, although performance was undercut by
mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), which were hurt by mortgage
prepayments. ABSs performed well in the second half of the period.
Beginning in October 2002 and continuing through period end, falling
default rates and increasing optimism about growth prospects for the
second half of 2003 convinced high-yield investors that the credit cycle
was turning in their favor. Following the lead of high-yield bonds,
emerging-market debt rallied as investors' risk tolerance and appetite
for yield increased.

In the final month of the period, bond market conditions changed
abruptly. Improved prospects for an upturn in the economic cycle and a
quickly increasing U.S. federal budget deficit made bonds less
attractive to both domestic and non-U.S. investors. The bond market
sell-off that resulted drove yields up and prices down rapidly across
all bond sectors.

Strategy overview

Putnam Premier Income Trust's multisector strategy served it well during
the fiscal year. It provided us with the flexibility to pursue the most
attractive fixed-income opportunities in a period when substantial
changes in investor sentiment drove significantly different returns
across fixed-income sectors.

Early in the period, the fund's allocation to investment-grade corporate
bonds contributed to returns as investors preferred the relative
security of these higher-quality bonds amid declining equity markets and
geopolitical uncertainty. In mid October, however, constructive fiscal
and monetary policies combined with easing geopolitical tension and
compelling valuations to shift investor focus to lower-rated
higher-yielding sectors. With yields in these sectors near historic
highs and fundamentals finally poised to improve, we believed that this
nascent rally had momentum behind it. Consequently, we began to rotate
assets out of investment-grade securities and into high-yield corporate
and emerging-market debt. This reallocation proved timely as the rally
in these sectors extended through June.

The fund's investment in high-yield corporate and emerging-market debt
was funded by the sale of mortgage-backed securities, which we believed
would continue to come under pressure due to mortgage prepayments in a
persistently low interest-rate environment. We also sold U.S. government
and agency securities, reasoning that they were unlikely to benefit
further from interest-rate declines. For most of the period, we favored
foreign investment-grade securities over their U.S. counterparts.

How allocations affected performance

In the U.S. investment-grade sector, the fund benefited from its
allocation to corporate bonds, which outperformed all other segments
within this sector. Investors were drawn to investment-grade corporate
bonds not only as a source of yield as interest rates fell, but also in
response to companies' focus on debt and cost reduction, which increased
the bonds' attractiveness. The fund's selective exposure to
investment-grade securitized debt also contributed positively as this
market segment outperformed U.S. Treasuries. (The fund's holdings in the
securitized sector consist primarily of mortgage-backed securities
(MBSs), commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs), asset-backed
securities (ABSs), and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).) Our
strategy of emphasizing high-coupon MBSs and CMBSs helped performance,
while holdings of ABSs hurt performance, as this segment was negatively
affected by the struggles of two major manufactured housing financiers
(Conseco and Greentree) in late 2002.

In the corporate high-yield sector, we consolidated the fund's
positions, while still maintaining a high level of diversification. We
also sought to reduce exposure to callable bonds. Call risk, which is
the risk that a bond issuer may redeem outstanding bonds before their
scheduled maturity, became a significant factor as bond issuers chose to
take advantage of declining yields to refinance their debt at lower
rates. Within industry sectors, large holdings in wireless
communications, diversified media, and broadcasting were top performers
in the market rally. Cable holdings also contributed positively to
performance.

Weightings are shown as a percentage of market value and are an

For the fund's foreign investment-grade holdings, we emphasized
higher-yielding European sovereign debt (e.g., Sweden) where yields had
considerably more room to fall than in the United States. Bonds issued
by Canada and New Zealand were also favored because we believed that
these countries had prematurely boosted rates at the onset of the
economic recovery. These strategies benefited the fund as rates declined
more significantly in all of these countries amid the global bond market
rally. In addition, the fund benefited from our currency strategy, which
correctly anticipated U.S. dollar and Japanese yen weakness as well as
the relative strength of the euro, U.K. pound sterling, and Canadian and
Australian dollars.

While the fund did benefit from its emerging-market debt holdings, our
strategy may have been too conservative within the sector, given the
breadth and strength of the rally. Some of the situations that most
concerned us -- the economic policies of the newly elected Brazilian
president, for example -- played out better than we had anticipated.
Nevertheless, the fund's exposure to Russia proved advantageous. Russian
government bonds were strong performers as windfall oil exporting
revenues accumulated in government coffers. Please note that all
holdings discussed in this report are subject to review in accordance
with the fund's investment strategy and may vary in the future.

OF SPECIAL INTEREST

In April 2003 the fund's monthly distribution was reduced from $0.045 to
$0.039 per share. This reduction was prompted by declining yields across
all fixed-income sectors over the course of the prolonged bond-market
rally. In addition, many issuers called bonds and many mortgages were
prepaid, requiring the fund to reinvest at lower rates.

The fund's management team

The fund is managed by the Putnam Core Fixed-Income Team. The members of
the team are D. William Kohli (Portfolio Leader), David Waldman
(Portfolio Member), Carl Bell, Rob Bloemker, Andrea Burke, Kevin Cronin,
Steve Horner, James Prusko, Michael Salm, and John Van Tassel.


The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

The abrupt and significant increase in interest rates over the last six
weeks of the reporting period has shifted our valuation perspective on
bonds. As of the end of the period, we believed markets had become
prematurely confident that a lasting global economic recovery was
already underway. Yields on 10-year Treasuries had climbed too high and
we believe they should stabilize in coming months. We have consequently
moved from an underweight in Treasuries toward a more neutral weighting
in our multisector portfolio. Elsewhere in the U.S. investment-grade
sector, we are currently neutral with regard to investment-grade
corporate bonds. While fundamentals continue to improve, investors have
already recognized this improvement, so valuations of investment-grade
corporate bonds are no longer attractive. Mortgage-backed securities
(MBSs) typically fare poorly in rising interest-rate environments, and
the past six weeks have been no exception. We believe this sector now
looks attractive on a relative valuation basis and we are poised to take
advantage of opportunities in it.

As fiscal 2004 begins, high-yield corporates remain attractive in our
view. Although their yield spread versus Treasuries, a traditional
measure of valuation, has moved closer to historical averages, we
believe that the positive cycle for this asset class has more room to
run based on continuing improvement in fundamentals, declining default
rates, and sustained demand among investors for higher yields.

While we still prefer higher-yielding European government debt to U.S.
Treasury bonds, the recent outperformance in Europe prompted us to trim
these holdings and increase our U.S. Treasury exposure somewhat. New
Zealand and Sweden, where we anticipate improving spreads, are two of
our favorite markets. Our view on emerging markets is less positive. The
increase in U.S. Treasury yields, diminishing inflows, and an upsurge in
lower-quality issuance all suggest that the market is too rich at
current levels. From a country selection standpoint, we continue to
favor Russia and Peru.

The management team believes that the fund's diverse portfolio, flexible
strategy, and focus on risk management will continue to serve it well.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. International
investing involves certain risks, such as currency fluctuations,
economic instability, and political  developments. Additional risks may
be associated with emerging-market securities, including illiquidity and
volatility. Lower-rated bonds may offer higher yields in return for more
risk. Mutual funds that invest in government securities are not
guaranteed. Mortgage-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk.

Putnam's policy on confidentiality

In order to conduct business with our shareholders, we must obtain
certain personal information such as account holders' addresses,
telephone numbers, Social Security numbers, and the names of their
financial advisors. We use this information to assign an account number
and to help us maintain accurate records of transactions and account
balances.

It is our policy to protect the confidentiality of your information,
whether or not you currently own shares of our funds, and in particular,
not to sell information about you or your accounts to outside marketing
firms. We have safeguards in place designed to prevent unauthorized
access to our computer systems and procedures to protect personal
information from unauthorized use.

Under certain circumstances, we share this information with outside
vendors who provide services to us, such as mailing and proxy
solicitation. In those cases, the service providers enter into
confidentiality agreements with us, and we provide only the information
necessary to process transactions and perform other services related to
your account. We may also share this information with our Putnam
affiliates to service your account or provide you with information about
other Putnam products or services. It is also our policy to share
account information with your financial advisor, if you've listed one on
your Putnam account.

If you would like clarification about our confidentiality policies or
have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us at

A guide to the financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,
preceded by the Independent Auditors' Report, constitute the fund's
financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values
as of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by
asset type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of
concentration and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together.  Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are
subtracted from this total. The result is divided by the number of
shares to determine the net asset value per share, which is calculated
separately for each class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares,
the amount subtracted from total assets includes the net assets
allocated to remarketed preferred shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss.
This is done by first adding up all the fund's  earnings -- from
dividends and interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses
to determine net investment income (or loss).  Then, any net gain or
loss the fund realized on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any
unrealized gains or losses over the period -- is added to or subtracted
from the net investment result to determine the fund's net gain or loss
for the fiscal year.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by distributions to shareholders and by changes in the number
of the fund's shares. It lists distributions and their sources (net
investment income or realized capital gains) over the current reporting
period and the most recent fiscal year-end. The distributions listed
here may not match the sources listed in the Statement of operations
because the distributions are determined on a tax basis and may be paid
in a different period from the one in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment
results, per-share  distributions, expense ratios, net investment income
ratios, and portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting the five
most recent reporting periods.  In a semiannual report, the highlight
table also includes the current reporting  period. For open-end funds, a
separate table is provided for each share class.


Independent auditors' report

The Board of Trustees and Shareholders
Putnam Premier Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
Putnam Premier Income Trust, including the fund's portfolio, as of July
31, 2003, and the related statement of operations for the year then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years
in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and
financial highlights are the responsibility of the fund's management.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that
we plan and perform our audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as
of July 31, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Putnam Premier Income Trust as of July 31, 2003,
the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in
its net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then
ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

Notes to financial statements
July 31, 2003

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Premier Income Trust ("the fund"), is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company. The fund's investment
objective is to seek high current income by allocating its investments
among the U.S. government sector, the high yield sector
and the international sector of the fixed-income securities market.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The fund invests in higher yielding, lower rated bonds that
have a higher rate of default due to the nature of the investments. The
preparation of financial statements is in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America and
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements
and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from
operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

A) Security valuation Investments for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at the last reported sales price on their
principal exchange, or official closing price for certain markets. If no
sales are reported -- as in the case of some securities traded
over-the-counter -- a security is valued at its last reported bid price.
Market quotations are not considered to be readily available for certain
debt obligations; such investments are valued at market value on the
basis of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service or
dealers, approved by the Trustees. Such services or dealers determine
valuations for normal institutional-size trading units of such
securities using methods based on market transactions for comparable
securities and various relationships, generally recognized by
institutional traders, between securities. For foreign investments, if
trading or events occurring in other markets after the close of the
principal exchange in which the securities are traded are expected to
materially affect the value of the investments, then those investments
are valued, taking into consideration these events, at their fair value
following procedures approved by the Trustees. Securities quoted in
foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the current
exchange rate. Short-term investments having remaining maturities of 60
days or less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair
value. Other investments, including restricted securities, are valued at
fair value following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such
valuations and procedures are reviewed periodically by the Trustees.

B) Joint trading account The fund may transfer uninvested cash balances,
including cash collateral received under security lending arrangements,
into a joint trading account along with the cash of other registered
investment companies and certain other accounts managed by Putnam
Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the fund's manager, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. These balances may be
invested in issuers of high-grade short-term investments having
maturities of up to 397 days for collateral received under security
lending arrangements and up to 90 days for other cash investments.

C) Repurchase agreements The fund, or any joint trading account, through
its custodian, receives delivery of the underlying securities, the
market value of which at the time of purchase is required to be in an
amount at least equal to the resale price, including accrued interest.
Collateral for certain tri-party repurchase agreements is held at the
counterparty's custodian in a segregated account for the benefit of the
fund and the counterparty. Putnam Management is responsible for
determining that the value of these underlying securities is at all
times at least equal to the resale price, including accrued interest.

D) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income is
recognized on the ex-dividend. Non-cash dividends, if any, are recorded
at the fair market value of the securities received.

All premiums/discounts are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis.

E) Foreign currency translation The accounting records of the fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. The market value of foreign securities,
currency holdings, and other assets and liabilities are recorded in the
books and records of the fund after translation to U.S. dollars based on
the exchange rates on that day. The cost of each security is determined
using historical exchange rates. Income and withholding taxes are
translated at prevailing exchange rates when earned or incurred. The
fund does not isolate that portion of realized or unrealized gains or
losses resulting from changes in the foreign exchange rate on
investments from fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices
of the securities. Such gains and losses are included with the net
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments. Net realized gains
and losses on foreign currency transactions represent net realized
exchange gains or losses on closed forward currency contracts,
disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized
between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions and
the difference between the amount of investment income and foreign
withholding taxes recorded on the fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation of assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies arise from changes in the value of open forward currency
contracts and assets and liabilities other than investments at the
period end, resulting from changes in the exchange rate. Investments in
foreign securities involve certain risks, including those related to
economic instability, unfavorable political developments, and currency
fluctuations, not present with domestic investments.

F) Forward currency contracts The fund may buy and sell forward currency
contracts, which are agreements between two parties to buy and sell
currencies at a set price on a future date. These contracts are used to
protect against a decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar of the
currencies in which its portfolio securities are denominated or quoted
(or an increase in the value of a currency in which securities a fund
intends to buy are denominated, when a fund holds cash reserves and
short term investments). The U.S. dollar value of forward currency
contracts is determined using current forward currency exchange rates
supplied by a quotation service. The market value of the contract will
fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. The contract is
marked to market daily and the change in market value is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss. When the contract is closed, the fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. The fund could be exposed to risk if the value of the currency
changes unfavorably, if the counterparties to the contracts are unable
to meet the terms of their contracts or if the fund is unable to enter
into a closing position. Forward currency contracts outstanding at
period end are listed after The fund's portfolio.

G) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund
owns or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on
securities it owns or in which it may invest to increase its current
returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures
and options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the
hedged instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the
value of the underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary
market for the contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is
unable to perform. When the contract is closed, the fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. Realized gains and losses on purchased options are included in
realized gains and losses on investment securities.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in
the value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as "variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last
sale price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for
purchased options and the last ask price for written options. Options
traded over-the-counter are valued using prices supplied by dealers.
Futures and written option contracts outstanding at period end are
listed after The fund's portfolio.

H) Total return swap contracts The fund may enter into total return swap
contracts, which are arrangements to exchange a market linked return for
an interest payment, both based on a notional principal amount. To the
extent that the total return of the security or index underlying the
transaction exceeds or falls short of the offsetting interest rate
obligation, the fund will receive a payment from or make a payment to
the counterparty, respectively. Total return swap contracts are marked
to market daily based upon quotations from market makers and the change,
if any, is recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or
made at the end of the measurement period are recorded as realized gains
or losses. The fund could be exposed to credit or market risk due to
unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of interest rates or in the price
of the underlying security or index, the possibility that there is no
liquid market for these agreements or that the counterparty may default
on its obligation to perform. Total return swap contracts outstanding at
period end are listed after The fund's portfolio.

I) Interest rate swap contracts The fund may enter into interest rate
swap contracts, which are arrangements between two parties to exchange
cash flows based on a notional principal amount, to manage the fund's
exposure to interest rates. Interest rate swap contracts are marked to
market daily based upon quotations from market makers and the change, if
any, is recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments made or received
are recognized as part of interest income. A portion of the payments
received or made upon early termination are recognized as realized gain
or loss. The fund could be exposed to credit or market risk due to
unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of interest rates or if the
counterparty defaults on its obligation to perform. Interest rate swap
contracts outstanding at period end are listed after The fund's
portfolio.

J) Credit default contracts The fund may enter into credit default
contracts where one party, the protection buyer, makes an upfront
payment to a counter party, the protection seller, in exchange for the
right to receive a contingent payment as a result of a credit event
related to a specified security or index. The upfront payment received
by the fund, as the protection seller, is recorded as a liability on the
fund's books. The credit default contracts are marked to market daily
based upon quotations from market makers and the change, if any, is
recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made as a
result of a credit event or termination of the contract are recognized,
net of a proportional amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains
or losses. In addition to bearing the risk that the credit event will
occur, the fund could be exposed to market risk due to unfavorable
changes in interest rates or in the price of the underlying security or
index, the possibility that the fund may be unable to close out its
position at the same time or at the same price as if it had purchased
comparable publicly traded securities or that the counterparty may
default on its obligation to perform. Credit default contracts
outstanding at period end are listed after The fund's portfolio.

K) TBA purchase commitments The fund may enter into "TBA" (to be
announced) commitments to purchase securities for a fixed unit price at
a future date beyond customary settlement time. Although the unit price
has been established, the principal value has not been finalized.
However, the amount of the commitments will not significantly differ
from the principal amount. The fund holds, and maintains until
settlement date, cash or high-grade debt obligations in an amount
sufficient to meet the purchase price, or the fund may enter into
offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other securities it owns.
Income on the securities will not be earned until settlement date. TBA
purchase commitments may be considered securities themselves, and
involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased
declines prior to the settlement date, which risk is in addition to the
risk of decline in the value of the fund's other assets. Unsettled TBA
purchase commitments are valued at the current market value of the
underlying securities, according to the procedures described under
"Security valuation" above.

Although the fund will generally enter into TBA purchase commitments
with the intention of acquiring securities for its portfolio or for
delivery pursuant to options contracts it has entered into, the fund may
dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if Putnam Management deems
it appropriate to do so.

L) TBA sale commitments The fund may enter into TBA sale commitments to
hedge its portfolio positions or to sell mortgage-backed securities it
owns under delayed delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA sale
commitments are not received until the contractual settlement date.
During the time a TBA sale commitment is outstanding, equivalent
deliverable securities, or an offsetting TBA purchase commitment
deliverable on or before the sale commitment date, are held as "cover"
for the transaction.

Unsettled TBA sale commitments are valued at the current market value of
the underlying securities, generally according to the procedures
described under "Security valuation" above. The contract is
"marked-to-market" daily and the change in market value is recorded by
the fund as an unrealized gain or loss. If the TBA sale commitment is
closed through the acquisition of an offsetting purchase commitment, the
fund realizes a gain or loss. If the fund delivers securities under the
commitment, the fund realizes a gain or a loss from the sale of the
securities based upon the unit price established at the date the
commitment was entered into. TBA sale commitments outstanding at period
end are listed after The fund's portfolio.

M) Security lending The fund may lend securities, through its agents, to
qualified borrowers in order to earn additional income. The loans are
collateralized by cash and/or securities in an amount at least equal to
the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of
securities loaned is determined daily and any additional required
collateral is allocated to the fund on the next business day. The risk
of borrower default will be borne by the fund's agents; the fund will
bear the risk of loss with respect to the investment of the cash
collateral. Income from securities lending is included in investment
income on the Statement of operations. At July 31, 2003, the value of
securities loaned amounted to $49,338. The fund received cash collateral
of $65,225, which is pooled with collateral of other Putnam funds into
30 issuers of high-grade short-term investments.

N) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
taxable income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund to distribute
an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax under Section
4982 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Therefore, no
provision has been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or
unrealized appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income
and capital gains.

At July 31, 2003, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $234,718,499
available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future net capital
gains, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover    Expiration
- --------------------------------
   $39,893,260    July 31, 2007
    44,857,570    July 31, 2008
    24,930,247    July 31, 2009
    44,917,486    July 31, 2010
    80,119,936    July 31, 2011

Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to regulated
investment companies, the fund has elected to defer to its fiscal year
ending July 31, 2004 $2,541,873 of losses recognized during the period
November 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003.

O) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. The amount and character of
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. These differences include temporary and permanent
differences of losses on wash sale transactions, post-October loss
deferrals, dividends payable, defaulted bond interest, realized and
unrealized gains and losses on certain futures contracts, market
discount and interest on payment-in-kind securities. Reclassifications
are made to the fund's capital accounts to reflect income and gains
available for distribution (or available capital loss carryovers) under
income tax regulations. For the year ended July 31, 2003, the fund
reclassified $21,127,007 to decrease distributions in excess of net
investment income and $123,243 to increase paid-in-capital, with an
increase to accumulated net realized losses of $21,250,250.

The tax basis components of distributable earnings and the federal tax
cost as of period end were as follows:

Unrealized appreciation                             $52,218,623
Unrealized depreciation                             (81,715,125)
                                                 --------------
Net unrealized depreciation                         (29,496,502)
Undistributed ordinary income                        21,457,186
Capital loss carryforward                          (234,718,499)
Post-October loss                                    (2,541,873)
Cost for federal income
tax purposes                                     $1,002,873,499

Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee
is based on the following annual rates: 0.75% of the first $500 million
of average weekly net assets, 0.65% of the next $500 million, 0.60% of
the next $500 million and 0.55% thereafter.

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company (PFTC), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Investor
servicing agent functions are provided by Putnam Investor Services, a
division of PFTC.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the year ended July 31, 2003, the
fund's expenses were reduced by $46,318 under these arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $1,208 has been allocated to the fund, and an additional fee for
each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive additional fees for
attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan"),
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense
for the fund is included in Compensation of Trustees in the Statement of
operations. Accrued pension liability is included in Payable for
compensation of Trustees in the Statement of assets and liabilities.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the year ended July 31, 2003, cost of purchases and proceeds from
sales of investment securities other than U.S. government obligations
and short-term investments aggregated $397,201,340 and $383,807,567,
respectively. Purchases and sales of U.S. government obligations
aggregated $594,058,519 and $610,912,132, respectively.

Fund information

About Putnam Investments

One of the largest mutual fund families in the United States, Putnam
Investments has a heritage of investment leadership dating back to Judge
Samuel Putnam, whose Prudent Man Rule has defined fiduciary tradition
and practice since 1830. Founded over 65 years ago, Putnam Investments

Item 2. Code of Ethics:
- -----------------------
All officers of the Fund, including its principal executive, financial and
accounting officers, are employees of Putnam Investment Management, LLC,
the Fund's investment manager.  As such they are subject to a comprehensive
Code of Ethics adopted and administered by Putnam Investments which is
designed to protect the interests of the firm and its clients.  The Fund
has adopted a Code of Ethics which incorporates the Code of Ethics of
Putnam Investments with respect to all of its officers and Trustees who are
employees of Putnam Investment Management, LLC.  For this reason, the Fund
has not adopted a separate code of ethics governing its principal
executive, financial and accounting officers.

Item 3. Audit Committee Financial Expert:
- -----------------------------------------
The Funds' Audit and Pricing Committee is comprised solely of Trustees
who are "independent" (as such term has been defined by the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in regulations implementing Section 407
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (the "Regulations")).  The Trustees believe
that each of the members of the Audit and Pricing Committee also possess
a combination of knowledge and experience with respect to financial
accounting matters, as well as other attributes, that qualify them for
service on the Committee.  In addition, the Trustees have determined
that all members of the Funds' Audit and Pricing Committee meet the
financial literacy requirements of the New York Stock Exchange's rules
and that Mr. Patterson and Mr. Stephens qualify as "audit committee
financial experts" (as such term has been defined by the Regulations)
based on their review of their pertinent experience and education.
Certain other Trustees, although not on the Audit and Pricing Committee,
would also qualify as "audit committee financial experts."  The SEC has
stated that the designation or identification of a person as an audit
committee financial expert pursuant to this Item 3 of Form N-CSR does
not impose on such person any duties, obligations or liability that are
greater than the duties, obligations and liability imposed on such
person as a member of the Audit and Pricing Committee and the Board of
Trustees in the absence of such designation or identification.

Item 7. Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures For Closed End

         Management Investment Companies:
         --------------------------------

Proxy Voting Guidelines of the Putnam Funds
- -------------------------------------------
The proxy voting guidelines below summarize the Funds' positions on
various issues of concern to investors, and give a general indication of
how Fund portfolio securities will be voted on proposals dealing with a
particular issue. The Funds' proxy voting service is instructed to vote
all proxies relating to Fund portfolio securities in accordance with
these guidelines, except as otherwise instructed by the Proxy
Coordinator.

The proxy voting guidelines are just that - guidelines. The guidelines
are not exhaustive and do not include all potential voting issues.
Because proxy issues and the circumstances of individual companies are
so varied, there may be instances when the Funds may not vote in strict
adherence to these guidelines. For example, the proxy voting service is
expected to bring to the Proxy Coordinator's attention proxy questions
that are company-specific and of a non-routine nature and, although
covered by the guidelines, may be more appropriately handled on a
case-by-case basis.

Similarly, Putnam Management's investment professionals, as part of
their ongoing review and analysis of all Fund portfolio holdings, are
responsible for monitoring significant corporate developments, including
proxy proposals submitted to shareholders, and notifying the Proxy
Coordinator of circumstances where the interests of Fund shareholders
may warrant a vote contrary to these guidelines. In such instances, the
investment professionals will submit a written recommendation to the
Proxy Coordinator and the person or persons designated by Putnam
Management's Legal and Compliance Department to assist in processing
referral items pursuant to the Funds' "Proxy Voting Procedures."  The
Proxy Coordinator, in consultation with the Senior Vice President,
Executive Vice President and/or the Chair of the Board Policy and
Nominating Committee, as appropriate, will determine how the Funds'
proxies will be voted. When indicated, the Chair of the Board Policy
and Nominating Committee may consult with other members of the Committee
or the full board of Trustees.

The following guidelines are grouped according to the types of proposals
generally presented to shareholders. Part I deals with proposals which
have been approved and recommended by a company's board of directors.
Part II deals with proposals submitted by shareholders for inclusion in
proxy statements. Part III addresses unique considerations pertaining
to foreign issuers.

I. Board-Approved Proposals
- ---------------------------
The vast majority of matters presented to shareholders for a vote
involve proposals made by a company itself (sometimes referred to as
"management proposals"), which have been approved and recommended by its
board of directors. In view of the enhanced corporate governance
practices currently being implemented in public companies and the Funds'
intent to hold corporate boards accountable for their actions in
promoting shareholder interests, the Funds' proxies generally will be
voted in support of decisions reached by independent boards of
directors. Accordingly, the Funds' proxies will be voted for
board-approved proposals, except as follows:

A. Matters Relating to the Board of Directors
- ---------------------------------------------
The board of directors has the important role of overseeing management
and its performance on behalf of shareholders. The Funds' proxies will
be voted for the election of the company's nominees for directors and
for board-approved proposals on other matters relating to the board of
directors (provided that such nominees and other matters have been
approved by an independent nominating committee), except as follows:

* The Funds will withhold votes for the entire board of directors if

* The board does not have a majority of independent directors; or

* The board does not have nominating, audit and compensation committees
composed solely of independent directors.

Commentary:  While these requirements will likely become mandatory for
most public companies in the near future as a result of pending NYSE and
NASDAQ rule proposals, the Funds' Trustees believe that there is no
excuse for public company boards that fail to implement these vital
governance reforms at their next annual meeting. For these purposes, an
"independent director" is a director who meets all requirements to serve
as an independent director of a company under the pending NYSE rule
proposals (i.e., no material business relationships with the company, no
present or recent employment relationship with the company (including
employment of immediate family members) and, in the case of audit
committee members, no compensation for non-board services). As
indicated below, the Funds will generally vote on a case-by-case basis
on board-approved proposals where the board fails to meet these basic
independence standards.

* The Funds will withhold votes for any nominee for director who is
considered an independent director by the company and who has received
compensation from the company other than for service as a director
(e.g., investment banking, consulting, legal or financial advisory
fees).

Commentary:  The Funds' Trustees believe that receipt of compensation
for services other than service as a director raises significant
independence issues. The Funds will withhold votes for any nominee for
director who is considered an independent director by the company and
who receives such compensation.

* The Funds will withhold votes for the entire board of directors if the
board has more than 19 members or fewer than five members, absent
special circumstances.

Commentary:  The Funds' Trustees believe that the size of the board of
directors can have a direct impact on the ability of the board to govern
effectively. Boards that have too many members can be unwieldy and
ultimately inhibit their ability to oversee management performance.
Boards that have too few members can stifle innovation and lead to
excessive influence by management.

* The Funds will vote on a case-by-case basis in contested elections of
directors.

* The Funds will withhold votes for any nominee for director who attends
less than 75% of board and committee meetings without valid reasons for
the absences (i.e., illness, personal emergency, etc.).

Commentary:  Being a director of a company requires a significant time
commitment to adequately prepare for and attend the company's board and
committee meetings. Directors must be able to commit the time and
attention necessary to perform their fiduciary duties in proper fashion,
particularly in times of crisis.

The Funds' Trustees are concerned about over-committed directors. In
some cases, directors may serve on too many boards to make a meaningful
contribution. This may be particularly true for senior executives of
public companies (or other directors with substantially full-time
employment) who serve on more than a few outside boards. The Funds may
withhold votes from such directors on a case-by-case basis where it
appears that they may be unable to discharge their duties properly
because of excessive commitments.

* The Funds will withhold votes for any nominee for director of a public
company (Company A) who is employed as a senior executive of another
public company (Company B) if a director of Company B serves as a senior
executive of Company A (commonly referred to as an "interlocking
directorate").

Commentary:  The Funds' Trustees believe that interlocking directorships
are inconsistent with the degree of independence required for outside
directors of public companies.

Board independence depends not only on its members' individual
relationships, but also the board's overall attitude toward management.
Independent boards are committed to good corporate governance practices
and, by providing objective independent judgment, enhancing shareholder
value. The Funds may withhold votes on a case-by-case basis from some or
all directors that, through their lack of independence, have failed to
observe good corporate governance practices or, through specific
corporate action, have demonstrated a disregard for the interest of
shareholders.

* The Funds will vote against  proposals to classify a board, absent
special circumstances indicating that shareholder interests would be
better served by this structure.

Commentary:  Under a typical classified board structure, the directors
are divided into three classes, with each class serving a three-year
term. The classified board structure results in directors serving
staggered terms, with usually only a third of the directors up for
re-election at any given annual meeting. The Funds' Trustees generally
believe that it is appropriate for directors to stand for election each
year, but recognize that, in special circumstances, shareholder
interests may be better served under a classified board structure.

B. Executive Compensation
- -------------------------
The Funds generally favor compensation programs that relate executive
compensation to a company's long-term performance. The Funds will vote
on a case-by-case basis on board-approved proposals relating to
executive compensation, except as follows:

* Except where the Funds are otherwise withholding votes for the entire
board of directors, the Funds will vote for stock option plans which
will result in an average annual dilution of 1.67% or less (including
all equity-based plans).

* The Funds will vote against stock option plans that permit replacing
or repricing of underwater options (and against any proposal to
authorize such replacement or repricing of underwater options).

* The Funds will vote against stock option plans that permit issuance of
options with an exercise price below the stock's current market price.

* Except where the Funds are otherwise withholding votes for the entire
board of directors, the Funds will vote for employee stock purchase
plans that have the following features:  (1) the shares purchased under
the plan are acquired for no less than 85% of their market value, (2)
the offering period under the plan is 27 months or less, and (3)
dilution is 10% or less.

Commentary:  Companies should have compensation programs that are
reasonable and that align shareholder and management interests over the
longer term. Further, disclosure of compensation programs should provide
absolute transparency to shareholders regarding the sources and amounts
of, and the factors influencing, executive compensation. Appropriately
designed equity-based compensation plans can be an effective way to
align the interests of long-term shareholders with the interests of
management. The Funds may vote against executive compensation proposals
on a case-by-case basis where compensation is excessive by reasonable
corporate standards, or where a company fails to provide transparent
disclosure of executive compensation. In voting on proposals relating to
executive compensation, the Funds will consider whether the proposal has
been approved by an independent compensation committee of the board.

C. Capitalization
- -----------------
Many proxy proposals involve changes in a company's capitalization,
including the authorization of additional stock, the repurchase of
outstanding stock or the approval of a stock split. The management of a
company's capital structure involves a number of important issues,
including cash flow, financing needs and market conditions that are
unique to the circumstances of each company. As a result, the Funds will
vote on a case-by-case basis on board-approved proposals involving
changes to a company's capitalization, except that where the Funds are
not otherwise withholding votes from the entire board of directors:

* The Funds will vote for proposals relating to the authorization of
additional common stock (except where such proposals relate to a
specific transaction).

* The Funds will vote for proposals to effect stock splits (excluding
reverse stock splits.)

* The Funds will vote for proposals authorizing share repurchase
programs.

Commentary:  A company may decide to authorize additional shares of
common stock for reasons relating to executive compensation or for
routine business purposes. For the most part, these decisions are best
left to the board of directors and senior management. The Funds will
vote on a case-by-case basis, however, on other proposals to change a
company's capitalization, including the authorization of common stock
with special voting rights, the authorization or issuance of common
stock in connection with a specific transaction (e.g., an acquisition,
merger or reorganization) or the authorization or issuance of preferred
stock. Actions such as these involve a number of considerations that may
impact a shareholder's investment and warrant a case-by-case
determination.

D. Acquisitions, Mergers, Reincorporations, Reorganizations and
    Other Transactions
- ---------------------------------------------------------------
Shareholders may be confronted with a number of different types of
transactions, including acquisitions, mergers, reorganizations involving
business combinations, liquidations and sale of all or substantially all
of a company's assets, which may require their consent. Voting on such
proposals involves considerations unique to each transaction. As a
result, the Funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on board-approved
proposals to effect these types of transactions, except as follows:

* The Funds will vote for mergers and reorganizations involving business
combinations designed solely to reincorporate a company in Delaware.

Commentary:  A company may reincorporate into another state through a
merger or reorganization by setting up a "shell" company in a different
state and then merging the company into the new company. While
reincorporation into states with extensive and established corporate
laws - notably Delaware - provides companies and shareholders with a
more well-defined legal framework, generally speaking, shareholders must
carefully consider the reasons for a reincorporation into another
jurisdiction, including especially offshore jurisdictions.

E. Anti-Takeover Measures
- -------------------------
Some proxy proposals involve efforts by management to make it more
difficult for an outside party to take control of the company without
the approval of the company's board of directors. These include adoption
of a shareholder rights plan, requiring supermajority voting on
particular issues, adoption of fair price provisions, issuance of blank
check preferred stock and creating a separate class of stock with
disparate voting rights. Such proposals may adversely affect shareholder
rights, lead to management entrenchment, or create conflicts of
interest. As a result, the Funds will vote against board-approved
proposals to adopt such anti-takeover measures, except as follows:

* The Funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to ratify or
approve shareholder rights plans (commonly referred to as "poison
pills"); and

* The Funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to adopt fair
price provisions.

Commentary:  The Funds' Trustees recognize that poison pills and fair
price provisions may enhance shareholder value under certain
circumstances. As a result, the Funds will consider proposals to approve
such matters on a case-by-case basis.

F. Other Business Matters
- -------------------------
Many proxies involve approval of routine business matters, such as
changing the company's name, ratifying the appointment of auditors and
procedural matters relating to the shareholder meeting. For the most
part, these routine matters do not materially affect shareholder
interests and are best left to the board of directors and senior
management of the company. The Funds will vote for board-approved
proposals approving such matters, except as follows:

* The Funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on proposals to amend a
company's charter or bylaws (except for charter amendments necessary or
to effect stock splits to change a company's name or to authorize
additional shares of common stock).

* The Funds will vote against authorization to transact other
unidentified, substantive business at the meeting.

* The Funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on other business matters
where the Funds are otherwise withholding votes for the entire board of
directors.

Commentary:  Charter and bylaw amendments and the transaction of other
unidentified, substantive business at a shareholder meeting may directly
affect shareholder rights and have a significant impact on shareholder
value. As a result, the Funds do not view such items as routine business
matters. Putnam Management's investment professionals and the Funds'
proxy voting service may also bring to the Proxy Coordinator's attention
company-specific items which they believe to be non-routine and
warranting special consideration. Under these circumstances, the Funds
will vote on a case-by-case basis.

II. Shareholder Proposals
- -------------------------
SEC regulations permit shareholders to submit proposals for inclusion in
a company's proxy statement. These proposals generally seek to change
some aspect of a company's corporate governance structure or to change
some aspect of its business operations. The Funds will vote in
accordance with the recommendation of the company's board of directors
on all shareholder proposals, except as follows:

* The Funds will vote for shareholder proposals to declassify a board,
absent special circumstances which would indicate that shareholder
interests are better served by a classified board structure.

* The Funds will vote for shareholder proposals to require shareholder
approval of shareholder rights plans.

* The Funds will vote for shareholder proposals that are consistent with
the Fund's proxy voting guidelines for board-approved proposals.

* The Funds will vote on a case-by-case basis on other shareholder
proposals where the Funds are otherwise withholding votes for the entire
board of directors.

Commentary:  In light of the substantial reforms in corporate governance
that are currently underway, the Funds' Trustees believe that effective
corporate reforms should be promoted by holding boards of directors -
and in particular, their independent directors - accountable for their
actions, rather than imposing additional legal restrictions on board
governance through piecemeal proposals. Generally speaking, shareholder
proposals relating to business operations are often motivated primarily
by political or social concerns, rather than the interests of
shareholders as investors in an economic enterprise. As stated above,
the Funds' Trustees believe that boards of directors and management are
responsible for ensuring that their businesses are operating in
accordance with high legal and ethical standards and should be held
accountable for resulting corporate behavior. Accordingly, the Funds
will generally support the recommendations of boards that meet the basic
independence and governance standards established in these guidelines.
Where boards fail to meet these standards, the Funds will generally
evaluate shareholder proposals on a case-by-case basis.

III. Voting Shares of Foreign Issuers
- -------------------------------------
Many of the Funds invest on a global basis and, as a result, they may be
required to vote shares held in foreign issuers - i.e., issuers that are
incorporated under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction and that are not
listed a U.S. securities exchange or the NASDAQ stock market. Because
foreign issuers are incorporated under the laws of countries and
jurisdictions outside the U.S., protection for shareholders may vary
significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Laws governing foreign
issuers may, in some cases, provide substantially less protection for
shareholders. As a result, the foregoing guidelines, which are premised
on the existence of a sound corporate governance and disclosure
framework, may not be appropriate under some circumstances for foreign
issuers. The Funds will vote proxies of foreign issuers in accordance
with the foregoing guidelines where applicable, except as follows:

* The Funds will vote for shareholder proposals calling for a majority
of the directors to be independent of management.

* The Funds will vote for shareholder proposals seeking to increase the
independence of board nominating, audit and compensation committees.

* The Funds will vote for shareholder proposals that implement corporate
governance standards similar to those established under U.S. federal law
and the listing requirements of U.S. stock exchanges, and that do not
otherwise violate the laws of the jurisdiction under which the company
is incorporated.

* The Funds will vote on case-by-case basis on proposals relating to (1)
the issuance of common stock in excess of 20% of a company's outstanding
common stock where shareholders do not have preemptive rights, or (2)
the issuance of common stock in excess of 100% of a company's
outstanding common stock where shareholders have preemptive rights.

Commentary:  In many non-U.S. markets, shareholders who vote proxies for
shares of a foreign issuer are not able to trade in that company's stock
within a given period of time on or around the shareholder meeting date.
This practice is known as "share blocking."  In countries where share
blocking is practiced, the Funds will vote proxies only with direction
from Putnam Management's investment professionals.


As adopted March 14, 2003




Proxy Voting Procedures of the Putnam Funds
- -------------------------------------------

The Role of the Funds' Trustees
- -------------------------------
The Trustees of the Putnam Funds exercise control of the voting of
proxies through their Board Policy and Nominating Committee, which is
composed entirely of independent Trustees. The Board Policy and
Nominating Committee oversees the proxy voting process and participates,
as needed, in the resolution of issues which need to be handled on a
case-by-case basis. The Committee annually reviews and recommends for
approval by the Trustees guidelines governing the Funds' proxy votes,
including how the Funds vote on specific proposals and which matters are
to be considered on a case-by-case basis. The Trustees are assisted in
this process by their independent administrative staff ("Fund
Administration"), independent legal counsel, and an independent proxy
voting service. The Trustees also receive assistance from Putnam
Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the Funds' investment
adviser, on matters involving investment judgments. In all cases, the
ultimate decision on voting proxies rests with the Trustees, acting as
fiduciaries on behalf of the shareholders of the Funds.

The Role of the Proxy Voting Service
- ------------------------------------
The Funds have engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in
the voting of proxies. The proxy voting service is responsible for
coordinating with the Funds' custodians to ensure that all proxy
materials received by the custodians relating to the Funds' portfolio
securities are processed in a timely fashion. To the extent applicable,
the proxy voting service votes all proxies in accordance with the proxy
voting guidelines established by the Trustees. The proxy voting service
will refer proxy questions to the Proxy Coordinator (described below)
for instructions under circumstances where: (1) the application of the
proxy voting guidelines is unclear, (2) a particular proxy question is
not covered by the guidelines, or (3) the guidelines call for specific
instructions on a case-by-case basis. The proxy voting service is also
requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's attention specific proxy
questions which, while governed by a guideline, appear to involve
unusual or controversial issues. The Funds also utilize research
services relating to proxy questions provided by the proxy voting
service and by other firms.

The Role of the Proxy Coordinator
- ---------------------------------
Each year, a member of Fund Administration is appointed Proxy
Coordinator to assist in the coordination and voting of the Funds'
proxies. The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy voting
service and, in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy voting
service, will solicit voting recommendations and instructions from Fund
Administration, the Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee,
and Putnam Management's investment professionals, as appropriate. The
Proxy Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that these questions and
referrals are responded to in a timely fashion and for transmitting
appropriate voting instructions to the proxy voting service.

  Voting Procedures for Referral Items
- -------------------------------------
As discussed above, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions
to the Proxy Coordinator under certain circumstances. When the
application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear or a particular
proxy question is not covered by the guidelines (and does not involve
investment considerations), the Proxy Coordinator will assist in
interpreting the guidelines and, as appropriate, consult with the Senior
Vice President of Fund Administration, the Executive Vice President of
Fund Administration and the Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating
Committee on how the Funds' shares will be voted.

For proxy questions that require a case-by-case analysis pursuant to the
guidelines or that are not covered by the guidelines but involve
investment considerations, the Proxy Coordinator will refer such
questions, through a written request, to Putnam Management's investment
professionals for a voting recommendation. Such referrals will be made
in cooperation with the person or persons designated by Putnam
Management's Legal and Compliance Department to assist in processing
such referral items. In connection with each such referral item, the
Legal and Compliance Department will conduct a conflicts of interest
review, as described below under "Conflicts of Interest," and provide a
conflicts of interest report (the "Conflicts Report") to the Proxy
Coordinator describing the results of such review. After receiving a
referral item from the Proxy Coordinator, Putnam Management's investment
professionals will provide a written recommendation to the Proxy
Coordinator and the person or persons designated by the Legal and
Compliance Department to assist in processing referral items. Such
recommendation will set forth (1) how the proxies should be voted, (2)
the basis and rationale for such recommendation, and (3) any contacts
the investment professionals have had with respect to the referral item
with non-investment personnel of Putnam Management or with outside
parties (except for routine communications from proxy solicitors). The
Proxy Coordinator will then review the investment professionals'
recommendation and the Conflicts Report with the Senior Vice President
and/or Executive Vice President in determining how to vote the Funds'
proxies. The Proxy Coordinator will maintain a record of all proxy
questions that have been referred to Putnam Management's investment
professionals, the voting recommendation and the Conflicts Report.

In some situations, the Proxy Coordinator, the Senior Vice President
and/or the Executive Vice President may determine that a particular
proxy question raises policy issues requiring consultation with the
Chair of the Board Policy and Nominating Committee who, in turn, may
decide to bring the particular proxy question to the Committee or the
full board of Trustees for consideration.

Conflicts of Interest
- ---------------------
Occasions may arise where a person or organization involved in the proxy
voting process may have a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest
may exist, for example, if Putnam Management has a business relationship
with (or is actively soliciting business from) either the company
soliciting the proxy or a third party that has a material interest in
the outcome of a proxy vote or that is actively lobbying for a
particular outcome of a proxy vote. Any individual with knowledge of a
personal conflict of interest (e.g., familial relationship with company
management) relating to a particular referral item shall disclose that
conflict to the Proxy Coordinator and the Legal and Compliance
Department and otherwise remove himself or herself from the proxy voting
process. The Legal and Compliance Department will review each item
referred to Putnam Management's investment professionals to determine if
a conflict of interest exists and will provide the Proxy Coordinator
with a Conflicts Report for each referral item that (1) describes any
conflict of interest; (2) discusses the procedures used to address such
conflict of interest; and (3) discloses any contacts from parties
outside Putnam Management (other than routine communications from proxy
solicitors) with respect to the referral item not otherwise reported in
an investment professional's recommendation. The Conflicts Report will
also include written confirmation that any recommendation from an
investment professional provided under circumstances where a conflict of
interest exists was made solely on the investment merits and without
regard to any other consideration.

THE PUTNAM FUNDS

Code of Ethics


Each of The Putnam Funds (the "Funds") has determined to adopt this Code
of Ethics with respect to certain types of personal securities
transactions by officers and Trustees of the Funds which might be deemed
to create possible conflicts of interest and to establish reporting
requirements and enforcement procedures with respect to such
transactions.

I. Rules Applicable to Officers and Trustees
   Affiliated with Putnam Investments, Inc.

A.  Incorporation of Adviser's Code of Ethics.  The provisions of the
Code of Ethics for employees of Putnam Investments, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries (the "Putnam Investments Code of Ethics"), which is
attached as Appendix A hereto, are hereby incorporated herein as the
Funds' Code of Ethics applicable to officers and Trustees of the Funds
who are employees of the Funds or officers, directors or employees of
Putnam Investments, Inc. or its subsidiaries.  A violation of the Putnam
Investments Code of Ethics shall constitute a violation of the Funds'
Code.

B.  Reports.  Officers and Trustees of each of the Funds who are made
subject to the Putnam Investments Code of Ethics pursuant to the
preceding paragraph shall file the reports required by the Putnam
Investments Code of Ethics with the Compliance Director designated
therein.  A report filed with the Compliance Director shall be deemed to
be filed with each of the Funds of which the reporting individual is an
officer or Trustee.

C.  Review.  (1)  The Compliance Director shall compare the reported
personal securities transactions with completed and contemplated
portfolio transactions of each of the Funds to determine whether a
violation of this Code may have occurred.  Before making any
determination that a violation has been committed by any person, the
Compliance Director shall give such person an opportunity to supply
additional explanatory material.

(2)  If the Compliance Director determines that a violation of this Code
has or may have occurred, he shall submit his written determination,
together with the confidential quarterly report and any additional
explanatory material provided by the individual, to the Chairman of the
Funds, who shall make an independent determination of whether a
violation has occurred.

D.  Sanctions.  If the Chairman of the Funds finds that a violation has
occurred, he shall report the violation and any sanction imposed under
the Putnam Code of Ethics to the Trustees of the Funds who may impose
such additional sanctions as they deem appropriate.  If a securities
transaction of the Chairman is under consideration, the Vice Chairman of
the Funds shall act in all respects in the manner prescribed herein for
the Chairman.


II. Rules Applicable to Unaffiliated Trustees

A.  Definitions.

(1) "Beneficial ownership" shall be interpreted in the same manner as
    it would be in determining whether a person is subject to the provisions
    of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and
    regulations thereunder.  Application of this definition is explained in
    more detail in Exhibit A hereto.

(2) "Control" means the power to exercise a controlling influence over
    the management or policies of a company, unless such power is solely the
    result of an official position with such company.

(3) "Interested Trustee" means a Trustee of a Fund who is an "interested
    person" of the Fund within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.

(4) "Purchase or sale of a security" includes, among other things, the
    writing of an option to purchase or sell a security.

(5) "Security" shall have the same meaning as that set forth in Section
    2(a)(36) of the Investment Company Act (in effect, all securities)
    except that it shall not include securities issued by the Government of
    the United States or an agency thereof, bankers' acceptances, bank
    certificates of deposit, commercial paper and shares of registered
    open-end investment companies.

(6) "Unaffiliated Trustee" means a Trustee who is not made subject to
    the Putnam Investments Code of Ethics pursuant to Part I hereof.

B. Prohibited Purchases and Sales.  No Unaffiliated Trustee of any of
the Funds shall purchase or sell, directly or indirectly, any security
in which he has or by reason of such transaction acquires, any direct or
indirect beneficial ownership and which to his actual knowledge at the
time of such purchase or sale:

(1) is being considered for purchase or sale by the Fund;

(2) is being purchased or sold by the Fund; or

(3) was purchased or sold by the Fund within the most recent five days
if such person participated in the recommendation to, or the decision
by, Putnam Management to purchase or sell such security for the Fund.


C.  Exempted Transactions.  The prohibitions of Section   II-B of this
Code shall not apply to:

(1)  purchases or sales effected in any account over which the
Unaffiliated Trustee has no direct or indirect influence or control;

(2)  purchases or sales which are non-volitional on the part of either
the Unaffiliated Trustee or the Fund;

(3)  purchases which are part of an automatic dividend reinvestment
plan;

(4)  purchases effected upon the exercise of rights issued by an issuer
pro rata to all holders of a class of its securities, to the extent such
rights were acquired from such issuer, and sales of such rights so
acquired;

(5)  purchases or sales other than those exempted in (1) through (4)
above which do not cause the Unaffiliated Trustee to gain improperly a
personal benefit through his relationship with the Fund and are only
remotely potentially harmful to a Fund because they would be very
unlikely to affect a highly institutional market, and are previously
approved by the Compliance Director under the Putnam Code of Ethics or
the Chairman of the Funds, which approval shall be confirmed in writing.


D.  Reporting.  (1)  Whether or not one of the exemptions listed in
Section II-C applies, every Unaffiliated Trustee of a Fund shall file
with the Chairman of the Funds a report containing the information
described in Section II-D(2) of this Code with respect to transactions
in any security in which such Unaffiliated Trustee has, or by reason of
such transaction acquires, any direct or indirect beneficial ownership,
if such Trustee, at the time of that transaction, knew or, in the
ordinary course of fulfilling his official duties as a Trustee of the
Fund, should have known that, during the 15-day period immediately
preceding or after the date of the transaction by the Trustee:

(a)  such security was or is to be purchased or sold by the Fund or

(b)  such security was or is being considered for purchase or sale by the Fund;

provided, however, that an Unaffiliated Trustee shall not be required to
make a report with respect to transactions effected for any account over
which such person does not have any direct or indirect influence or
control.

(2)  Every report shall be made not later than 10 days after the end of
the calendar quarter in which the transaction to which the report
relates was effected, and shall contain the following information:

(a)  The date of the transaction, the title and the number of shares, and the
     principal amount of each security involved;

(b)  The nature of the transaction (i.e., purchase, sale or any other type of
     acquisition or disposition);

(c)  The price at which the transaction was effected; and

(d)  The name of the broker, dealer or bank with or through whom the
     transaction was effected.

(3)  Every report concerning a purchase or sale prohibited under Section
II-B hereof with respect to which the reporting person relies upon one
of the exemptions provided in Section IIC shall contain a brief
statement of the exemption relied upon and the circumstances of the
transaction.

(4)  Any such report may contain a statement that the report shall not
be construed as an admission by the person making such report that he
has any direct or indirect beneficial ownership in the security to which
the report relates.

(5)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an
Unaffiliated Trustee who is an Interested Trustee shall also file the
reports required by Rule 17j-1(c)(1) under the Investment Company Act of
1940.


E.  Review.  (1)  The Chairman of the Funds shall compare the reported
personal securities transactions with completed and contemplated
portfolio transactions of the Funds to determine whether any transaction
("Reviewable Transactions") listed in Section II-B (disregarding
exemptions provided by Section II-C(1) through (5)) may have occurred.

(2)  If the Chairman determines that a Reviewable Transaction may have
occurred, he shall then determine whether a violation of this Code may
have occurred, taking into account all the exemptions provided under
Section II-C.  Before making any determination that a violation has
occurred, the Chairman shall give the person involved an opportunity to
supply additional information regarding the transaction in question.

F.  Sanctions.  If the Chairman determines that a violation of this Code
has occurred, he shall so advise a committee consisting of the
Unaffiliated Trustees, other than the person whose transaction is under
consideration, and shall provide the committee with a report of the
matter, including any additional information supplied by such person.
The committee may impose such sanction as it deems appropriate.


III.  Miscellaneous.

A.  Amendments to The Putnam Companies Code of Ethics.  Any amendment to
the Putnam Companies Code of Ethics shall be deemed an amendment to
Section I-A of this Code effective 30 days after written notice of such
amendment shall have been received by the Chairman of the Funds, unless
the Trustees of the Funds expressly determine that such amendment shall
become effective at an earlier or later date or shall not be adopted.

B.  Records.  The Funds shall maintain records in the manner and to the
extent set forth below, which records may be maintained on microfilm
under the conditions described in Rule 31a-2(f)(1) under the Investment
Company Act and shall be available for examination by representatives of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1)  A copy of this Code and any other code which is, or at any time
within the past five years has been, in effect shall be preserved in an
easily accessible place;

(2)  A record of any violation of this Code and of any action taken as a
result of such violation shall be preserved in an easily accessible
place for a period of not less than five years following the end of the
fiscal year in which the violation occurs;

(3)  A copy of each report made by an officer or Trustee pursuant to
this Code shall be preserved for a period of not less than five years
from the end of the fiscal year in which it is made, the first two years
in an easily accessible place; and

(4)  A list of all person who are, or within the past five years have
been, required to make reports pursuant to this Code shall be maintained
in an easily accessible place.


C.  Confidentiality.  All reports of securities transactions and any
other information filed with any Fund pursuant to this Code shall be
treated as confidential, but are subject to review as provided herein
and by personnel of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

D.  Interpretation of Provisions.  The Directors and Trustees may from
time to time adopt such interpretations of this Code as they deem
appropriate.

E.  Delegation by Chairman.  The Chairman of the Funds may from time to
time delegate any or all of his responsibilities under this Code, either
generally or as to specific instances, to such officer or Trustee of the
Funds as he may designate.

* Overview

Every Putnam employee is required, as a condition of continued
employment, to read, understand, and comply with the entire Code of
Ethics. Additionally, employees are expected to comply with the policies
and procedures contained within the Putnam Employee Handbook, which can
be accessed on-line through www.ibenefitcenter.com.  This Overview is
provided only as a convenience and is not intended to substitute for a
careful reading of the complete document.

It is the personal responsibility of every Putnam employee to avoid any
conduct that could create a conflict, or even the appearance of a
conflict, with our clients, or do anything that could damage or erode
the trust our clients place in Putnam and its employees. This is the
spirit of the Code of Ethics. In accepting employment at Putnam, every
employee accepts the absolute obligation to comply with the letter and
the spirit of the Code of Ethics. Failure to comply with the spirit of
the Code of Ethics is just as much a violation of the Code as failure to
comply with the written rules of the Code.

The rules of the Code cover activities, including personal securities
transactions, of Putnam employees, certain family members of employees,
and entities (such as corporations, trusts, or partnerships) that
employees may be deemed to control or influence.

Sanctions will be imposed for violations of the Code of Ethics.
Sanctions may include bans on personal trading, reductions in salary
increases or bonuses, disgorgement of trading profits, suspension of
employment, and termination of employment.

- -- Insider trading:

   Putnam employees are forbidden to buy or sell any security while
   either Putnam or the employee is in possession of non-public
   information ("inside information") concerning the security or the
   issuer. A violation of Putnam's insider trading policies may result
   in criminal and civil penalties, including imprisonment and
   substantial fines.

- -- Conflicts of interest:

   The Code of Ethics imposes limits on activities of Putnam employees
   where the activity may conflict with the interests of Putnam or its
   clients. These include limits on the receipt and solicitation of
   gifts and on service as a fiduciary for a person or entity outside of
   Putnam.

   For example, Putnam employees generally may not accept gifts over
   $100 in total value in a calendar year from any entity or any
   supplier of goods or services to Putnam. In addition, a Putnam
   employee may not serve as a director of any corporation without prior
   approval of the Code of Ethics Officer, and Putnam employees may not
   be members of investment clubs.

- -- Confidentiality:

   Information about Putnam clients and Putnam investment activity and
   research is proprietary and confidential and may not be disclosed or
   used by any Putnam employee outside Putnam without a valid business
   purpose.

- -- Personal securities trading:

   Putnam employees may not buy or sell any security for their own
   account without clearing the proposed transaction in advance through
   the on-line pre-clearance system or with the Code of Ethics
   Administrator.

   Certain securities are excepted from this requirement (e.g., Marsh &
   McLennan stock and shares of open-end (not closed-end) Putnam Funds).

   Clearance must be obtained in advance, between 11:30 a.m. and 4:00
   p.m. EST on the day of the trade.  Clearance may be obtained between
   9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on the day of the trade for up to 1,000
   shares of stock of an issuer whose capitalization exceeds $5 billion.
   A clearance is valid only for the day it is obtained.  The Code also
   strongly discourages excessive trading by employees for their own
   account (i.e., more than 10 trades in any calendar quarter). Trading
   in excess of this level will be reviewed with the Code of Ethics
   Oversight Committee.

- -- Short Selling:

   Putnam employees are prohibited from short selling any security,
   whether or not it is held in a Putnam client portfolio, except that
   short selling against broad market indexes and "against the box" are
   permitted.

- -- Confirmations of trading and periodic account statements:

   All Putnam employees must have their brokers send confirmations of
   personal securities transactions, including transactions of immediate
   family members and accounts over which the employee has investment
   discretion, to the Code of Ethics Officer. Employees must contact the
   Code of Ethics Administrator to obtain an authorization letter from
   Putnam for setting up a personal brokerage account.


- -- Quarterly and annual reporting:

   Certain Putnam employees (so-called "Access Persons" as defined by
   the SEC and in the Code of Ethics) must report all their securities
   transactions in each calendar quarter to the Code of Ethics Officer
   within 10 days after the end of the quarter.   All Access Persons
   must disclose all personal securities holdings upon commencement of
   employment and thereafter on an annual basis.  You will be notified
   if these requirements apply to you. If these requirements apply to
   you and you fail to report as required, salary increases and bonuses
   will be reduced.

- -- IPOs and private placements:

   Putnam employees may not buy any securities in an initial public
   offering or in a private placement, except in limited circumstances
   when prior written authorization is obtained.

- -- Procedures for Approval of New Financial Instruments:

   No new types of securities or instruments may be purchased for any
   Putnam fund or other client account without the prior approval of the
   Risk Management Committee.

- -- Personal securities transactions by Access Persons and certain investment
   professionals:

   The Code imposes several special restrictions on personal securities
   transactions by Access Persons and certain investment professionals,
   which are summarized as follows:

- -- "60-Day Holding Period". No Access Person shall purchase and then sell at a
   profit, or sell and then repurchase at a lower price, any security or
   related derivative security within 60 calendar days.

- -- "7-Day" Rule. Before a portfolio manager places an order to buy a security
   for any portfolio he manages, he must sell from his personal account any
   such security or related derivative security purchased within the preceding
   7 calendar days and disgorge any profit from the sale.

- -- "Blackout" Rules. No portfolio manager may sell any security or
   related derivative security for her personal account until 7 calendar
   days have passed since the most recent purchase of that security or
   related derivative security by any portfolio she manages. No portfolio
   manager may buy any security or related derivative security for his
   personal account until 7 calendar days have passed since the most recent
   sale of that security or related derivative security by any portfolio he
   manages.

- -- "Contra-Trading" Rule. No portfolio manager may sell out of her personal
   account any security or related derivative security that is held in any
   portfolio she manages unless she has received the written approval of a
   CIO and the Code of Ethics Officer.

- -- No manager may cause a Putnam client to take action for the manager's own
   personal benefit.

- -- SIMILAR RULES LIMIT PERSONAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS BY ANALYSTS,
   CO-MANAGERS, AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICERS. PLEASE READ THESE RULES
   CAREFULLY. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR UNDERSTANDING THE RESTRICTIONS.

This Overview is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of the Code
of Ethics. The Code requires that all Putnam employees read, understand,
and comply with the entire Code of Ethics.


* Preamble

It is the personal responsibility of every Putnam employee to avoid any
conduct that would create a conflict, or even the appearance of a
conflict, with our clients, or embarrass Putnam in any way. This is the
spirit of the Code of Ethics. In accepting employment at Putnam, every
employee also accepts the absolute obligation to comply with the letter
and the spirit of the Code of Ethics. Failure to comply with the spirit
of the Code of Ethics is just as much a violation of the Code as failure
to comply with the written rules of the Code.

Sanctions will be imposed for violations of the Code of Ethics,
including the Code's reporting requirements. Sanctions may include bans
on personal trading, reductions in salary increases or bonuses,
disgorgement of trading profits, suspension of employment and
termination of employment.

Putnam Investments is required by law to adopt a Code of Ethics. The
purposes of the law  are to ensure that companies and their employees
comply with all applicable laws and to prevent abuses in the investment
advisory business that can arise when conflicts of interest exist
between the employees of an investment adviser and its clients. Having
an effective Code of Ethics is good business practice, as well. By
adopting and enforcing a Code of Ethics, we strengthen the trust and
confidence reposed in us by demonstrating that, at Putnam, client
interests come before personal interests.

Putnam has had a Code of Ethics for many years. The first Putnam Code
was written more than 30 years ago by George Putnam. It has been revised
periodically, and was re-drafted in its entirety in 1989 to take account
of legal and regulatory developments in the investment advisory
business. Since 1989, the Code has been revised regularly to reflect
developments in our business and the law.

The Code that follows represents a balancing of important interests. On
the one hand, as a registered investment adviser, Putnam owes a duty of
undivided loyalty to its clients, and must avoid even the appearance of
a conflict that might be perceived as abusing the trust they have placed
in Putnam. On the other hand, Putnam does not want to prevent
conscientious professionals from investing for their own account where
conflicts do not exist or are so attenuated as to be immaterial to
investment decisions affecting Putnam clients.

When conflicting interests cannot be reconciled, the Code makes clear
that, first and foremost, Putnam employees owe a fiduciary duty to
Putnam clients. In most cases, this means that the affected employee
will be required to forego conflicting personal securities transactions.
In some cases, personal investments will be permitted, but only in a
manner which, because of the circumstances and applicable controls,
cannot reasonably be perceived as adversely affecting Putnam client
portfolios or taking unfair advantage of the relationship Putnam
employees have to Putnam clients.

The Code contains specific rules prohibiting defined types of conflicts.
Because every potential conflict cannot be anticipated in advance, the
Code also contains certain general provisions prohibiting conflict
situations. In view of these general provisions, it is critical that any
individual who is in doubt about the applicability of the Code in a
given situation seek a determination from the Code of Ethics Officer
about the propriety of the conduct in advance. The procedures for
obtaining such a determination are described in Section VII of the Code.

It is critical that the Code be strictly observed. Not only will
adherence to the Code ensure that Putnam renders the best possible
service to its clients, it will ensure that no individual is liable for
violations of law.

It should be emphasized that adherence to this policy is a fundamental
condition of employment at Putnam. Every employee is expected to adhere
to the requirements of this Code of Ethics despite any inconvenience
that may be involved. Any employee failing to do so may be subject to
such disciplinary action, including financial penalties and termination
of employment, as determined by the Code of Ethics Oversight Committee
or the Chief Executive Officer of Putnam Investments.

* Section I.   Personal Securities Rules for All Employees

A.   Restricted List

RULE 1

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell for his personal account any
security without prior clearance obtained through Putnam's Intranet
pre-clearance system (in the "Workplace Community" section of
ibenefitcenter.com) or from the Code of Ethics Administrator. No
clearance will be granted for securities appearing on the Restricted
List. Securities shall be placed on the Restricted List in the following
circumstances:

(a) when orders to purchase or sell such security have been entered for any
    Putnam client, or the security is being actively considered for purchase
    or sale for any Putnam client;

(b) with respect to voting securities of corporations in the banking, savings
    and loan, communications, or gaming (i.e., casinos) industries, when
    holdings of Putnam clients exceed 7% (for public utilities, the threshold
    is 4%);

(c) when, in the judgment of the Code of Ethics Officer, other circumstances
    warrant restricting personal transactions of Putnam employees in a
    particular security;

(d) the circumstances described in the Policy Statement Concerning Insider
    Trading Prohibitions, attached as Appendix A.

Reminder: Securities for an employee's "personal account" include
securities owned by certain family members of a Putnam employee. Thus,
this Rule prohibits certain trades by family members of Putnam
employees. See Definitions.

Compliance with this rule does not exempt an employee from complying
with any other applicable rules of the Code, such as those described in
Section III. In particular, Access Persons and certain investment
professionals must comply with the special rules set forth in Section
II.

EXCEPTIONS

A. "Large Cap" Exception. If a security appearing on the Restricted List is
   an equity security for which the issuer has a market capitalization
   (defined as outstanding shares multiplied by current price per share) of
   over $5 billion, then a Putnam employee may purchase or sell up to 1,000
   shares of the security per day for his personal account. This exception
   does not apply if the security appears on the Restricted List in the
   circumstances described in subpart (b), (c), or (d) of Rule 1.

B. Investment Grade Or Higher Fixed-Income Exception. If a security being
   traded or considered for trade for a Putnam client is a non-convertible
   fixed-income security which bears a rating of BBB (Standard & Poor's) or
   Baa (Moody's) or any comparable rating or higher, then a Putnam employee
   may purchase or sell that security for his personal account without regard
   to the activity of Putnam clients. This exception does not apply if the
   security has been placed on the Restricted List in the circumstances
   described in subpart (b), (c), or (d) of Rule 1.

C. Pre-Clearing Transactions Effected by Share Subscription. The purchase and
   sale of securities made by subscription rather than on an exchange are
   limited to issuers having a market capitalization of $5 billion or more
   and are subject to a 1,000 share limit. The following are procedures to
   comply with Rule 1 when effecting a purchase or sale of shares by
   subscription:

(a) The Putnam employee must pre-clear the trade on the day he or she submits a
    subscription to the issuer, rather than on the actual day of the trade
    since the actual day of the trade typically will not be known to the
    employee who submits the subscription. At the time of pre-clearance, the
    employee will be told whether the purchase is permitted (in the case of a
    corporation having a market capitalization of $5 billion or more), or not
    permitted (in the case of a smaller capitalization issuer).

(b) The subscription for any purchase or sale of shares must be reported on
    the employee's quarterly personal securities transaction report, noting
    the trade was accomplished by subscription.

(c) As no brokers are involved in the transaction, the confirmation requirement
    will be waived for these transactions, although the Putnam employee must
    provide the Legal and Compliance Department with any transaction summaries
    or statements sent by the issuer.


 SANCTION GUIDELINES

A. Failure to Pre-Clear a Personal Trade

1. First violation: One month trading ban with written warning that a future
   violation will result in a longer trading ban.

2. Second violation: Three month trading ban and written notice to Managing
   Director of the employee's division.

3. Third violation: Six month trading ban with possible longer or permanent
   trading ban based upon review by Code of Ethics Oversight Committee.

B. Failure to Pre-Clear Securities on the Restricted List

1. First violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction, one month
   trading ban, and written warning that a future violation will result in a
   longer trading ban.

2. Second violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction, three
   month trading ban, and written notice to Managing Director of the
   employee's division.

3. Third violation: Disgorgement of any profit from the transaction, and six
   month trading ban with possible longer or permanent trading ban based upon
   review by Code of Ethics Oversight Committee.

NOTE: These are the sanction guidelines for successive failures to
pre-clear personal trades within a 2-year period.  The Code of Ethics
Oversight Committee retains the right to increase or decrease the
sanction for a particular violation in light of the circumstances.  The
Committee's belief that an employee intentionally has violated the Code
of Ethics will result in more severe sanctions than outlined in the
guidelines above.  The sanctions described in Paragraph B apply to
Restricted List securities that are: (i) small cap stocks (i.e., stocks
not entitled to the "Large Cap" exception) and (ii) large cap stocks
that exceed the daily 1,000 share maximum permitted under the "Large
Cap" exception. Failure to pre-clear an otherwise permitted trade of up
to 1,000 shares of a large cap security is subject to the sanctions
described above in Paragraph A.

IMPLEMENTATION

A. Maintenance of Restricted List. The Restricted List shall be maintained by
   the Code of Ethics Administrator.

B. Consulting Restricted List.  An employee wishing to trade any security for
   his personal account shall first obtain clearance through Putnam's
   Intranet pre-clearance system.  The system may be accessed from your
   desktop computer through the Putnam ibenefitcenter
   (https://www.ibenefitcenter.com) Workplace Community tab, Employee
   Essentials menu.  Employees may pre-clear all securities between 11:30 a.m.
   and 4:00 p.m. EST, and may pre-clear purchases or sales of up to 1,000
   shares of issuers having a market capitalization of more than $5 billion
   between 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. EST.   Requests to make personal securities
   transactions may not be made using the system or presented to the Code of
   Ethics Administrator after 4:00 p.m.

The pre-clearance system will inform the employee whether the security
may be traded and whether trading in the security is subject to the
"Large Cap" limitation.  The response of the pre-clearance system as to
whether a security appears on the Restricted List and, if so, whether it
is eligible for the exceptions set forth after this Rule shall be final,
unless the employee appeals to the Code of Ethics Officer, using the
procedure described in Section VII, regarding the request to trade a
particular security.

A clearance is only valid for trading on the day it is obtained.  Trades
in securities listed on Asian or European stock exchanges, however, may
be executed within one business day after pre-clearance is obtained.

If a security is not on the Restricted List, other classes of securities
of the same issuer (e.g., preferred or convertible preferred stock) may
be on the Restricted List.  It is the employee's responsibility to
identify with particularity the class of securities for which permission
is being sought for a personal investment.

If the pre-clearance system does not recognize a security, or if an
employee is unable to use the system or has any questions with respect
to the system or pre-clearance, the employee may consult the Code of
Ethics Administrator.  The Code of Ethics Administrator shall not have
authority to answer any questions about a security other than whether
trading is permitted.  The response of the Code of Ethics Administrator
as to whether a security appears on the Restricted List and, if so,
whether it is eligible for the exceptions set forth after this Rule
shall be final, unless the employee appeals to the Code of Ethics
Officer, using the procedure described in Section VII, regarding the
request to trade a particular security.

C. Removal of Securities from Restricted List. Securities shall be removed
   from the Restricted List when: (a) in the case of securities on the
   Restricted List pursuant to Rule 1(a), they are no longer being purchased
   or sold for a Putnam client or actively considered for purchase or sale
   for a Putnam client; (b) in the case of securities on the Restricted List
   pursuant to Rule 1(b), the holdings of Putnam clients fall below the
   applicable threshold designated in that Rule, or at such earlier time as
   the Code of Ethics Officer deems appropriate; or (c) in the case of
   securities on the Restricted List pursuant to Rule 1(c) or 1(d), when
   circumstances no longer warrant restrictions on personal trading.

COMMENTS

1. Pre-Clearance. Subpart (a) of this Rule is designed to avoid the conflict
   of interest that might occur when an employee trades for his personal
   account a security that currently is being traded or is likely to be
   traded for a Putnam client. Such conflicts arise, for example, when the
   trades of an employee might have an impact on the price or availability
   of a particular security, or when the trades of the client might have an
   impact on price to the benefit of the employee. Thus, exceptions involve
   situations where the trade of a Putnam employee is unlikely to have an
   impact on the market.

2. Regulatory Limits. Owing to a variety of federal statutes and regulations
   in the banking, savings and loan, communications, and gaming industries, it
   is critical that accounts of Putnam clients not hold more than 10% of the
   voting securities of any issuer (5% for public utilities). Because of the
   risk that the personal holdings of Putnam employees may be aggregated with
   Putnam holdings for these purposes, subpart (b) of this Rule limits personal
   trades in these areas. The 7% limit (4% for public utilities) will allow the
   regulatory limits to be observed.

3. Options. For the purposes of this Code, options are treated like the
   underlying security. See Definitions. Thus, an employee may not purchase,
   sell, or "write" option contracts for a security that is on the Restricted
   List. A securities index will not be put on the Restricted List simply
   because one or more of its underlying securities have been put on the
   Restricted List.  The exercise of an options contract (the purchase or
   writing of which was previously pre-cleared) does not have to be
   pre-cleared.  Note, however, that the sale of securities obtained through
   the exercise of options must be pre-cleared.

4. Involuntary Transactions. "Involuntary" personal securities transactions
   are exempted from the Code. Special attention should be paid to this
   exemption. (See Section I.D.)

5. Tender Offers. This Rule does not prohibit an employee from tendering
   securities from his personal account in response to an any-and-all tender
   offer, even if Putnam clients are also tendering securities. A Putnam
   employee is, however, prohibited from tendering securities from his
   personal account in response to a partial tender offer, if Putnam clients
   are also tendering securities.

B. Prohibited Transactions


RULE 1

Putnam employees are prohibited from short selling any security, whether
or not the security is held in a Putnam client portfolio.

EXCEPTIONS

Short selling against broad market indexes (such as the Dow Jone
Industrial Average, the NASDAQ index and the S&P 100 and 500 indexes)
and short selling "against the box" are permitted.

RULE 2

No Putnam employee shall purchase any security for her personal account
in an initial public offering.

EXCEPTION

Pre-existing Status Exception. A Putnam employee shall not be barred by
this Rule or by Rule 1(a) of Section I.A. from purchasing securities for
her personal account in connection with an initial public offering of
securities by a bank or insurance company when the employee's status as
a policyholder or depositor entitles her to purchase securities on terms
more favorable than those available to the general public, in connection
with the bank's conversion from mutual or cooperative form to stock
form, or the insurance company's conversion from mutual to stock form,
provided that the employee has had the status entitling her to purchase
on favorable terms for at least two years. This exception is only
available with respect to the value of bank deposits or insurance
policies that an employee owns before the announcement of the initial
public offering. This exception does not apply, however, if the security
appears on the Restricted List in the circumstances set forth in
subparts (b), (c), or (d) of Section I.A., Rule 1.

IMPLEMENTATION

A. General Implementation. An employee shall inquire, before any purchase
   of a security for her personal account, whether the security to be
   purchased is being offered pursuant to an initial public offering. If
   the security is offered through an initial public offering, the employee
   shall refrain from purchasing that security for her personal account
   unless the exception applies.


B. Administration of Exception. If the employee believes the exception
   applies, she shall consult the Code of Ethics Administrator concerning
   whether the security appears on the Restricted List and if so, whether
   it is eligible for this exception.

COMMENTS

1. The purpose of this rule is twofold. First, it is designed to prevent a
   conflict of interest between Putnam employees and Putnam clients who
   might be in competition for the same securities in a limited public
   offering. Second, the rule is designed to prevent Putnam employees from
   being subject to undue influence as a result of receiving "favors" in
   the form of special allocations of securities in a public offering from
   broker-dealers who seek to do business with Putnam.

2. Purchases of securities in the immediate after-market of an initial
   public offering are not prohibited, provided they do not constitute
   violations of other portions of the Code of Ethics. For example,
   participation in the immediate after-market as a result of a special
   allocation from an underwriting group would be prohibited by Section III,
   Rule 3 concerning gifts and other "favors."

3. Public offerings subsequent to initial public offerings are not deemed
   to create the same potential for competition between Putnam employees
   and Putnam clients because of the pre-existence of a market for the
   securities.

RULE 3

No Putnam employee shall purchase any security for his personal account
in a limited private offering or private placement.

COMMENTS

1. The purpose of this Rule is to prevent a Putnam employee from investing
   in securities for his own account pursuant to a limited private offering
   that could compete with or disadvantage Putnam clients, and to prevent
   Putnam employees from being subject to efforts to curry favor by those
   who seek to do business with Putnam.

2. Exemptions to the prohibition will generally not be granted where the
   proposed investment relates directly or indirectly to investments by a
   Putnam client, or where individuals involved in the offering (including
   the issuers, broker, underwriter, placement agent, promoter, fellow
   investors and affiliates of the foregoing) have any prior or existing
   business relationship with Putnam or a Putnam employee, or where the
   Putnam employee believes that such individuals may expect to have a
   future business relationship with Putnam or a Putnam employee.

3. An exemption may be granted, subject to reviewing all the facts and
   circumstances, for investments in:

(a) Pooled investment funds, including hedge funds, subject to the condition
    that an employee investing in a pooled investment fund would have no
    involvement in the activities or decision-making process of the fund
    except for financial reports made in the ordinary course of the fund's
    business.

(b) Private placements where the investment cannot relate, or be expected
    to relate, directly or indirectly to Putnam or investments by a Putnam
    client.

4. Employees who apply for an exemption will be expected to disclose to the
   Code of Ethics Officer in writing all facts and relationships relating to
   the proposed investment.

5. Limited partnership interests are frequently sold in private placements.
   An employee should assume that investment in a limited partnership is
   barred by these rules, unless the employee has obtained, in advance of
   purchase, a written exemption under the ad hoc exemption set forth in
   Section I.D., Rule 2. The procedure for obtaining an ad hoc exemption is
   described in Section VII, Part 4.

6. Applications to invest in private placements will be reviewed by the Code
   of Ethics Oversight Committee. This review will take into account, among
   other factors, the considerations described in the preceding comments.

RULE 4

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security for her personal
account or for any Putnam client account while in possession of
material, nonpublic information concerning the security or the issuer.

EXCEPTIONS

NONE. Please read Appendix A, Policy Statement Concerning Insider
Trading Prohibitions.

RULE 5

No Putnam employee shall purchase from or sell to a Putnam client any
securities or other property for his personal account, nor engage in any
personal transaction to which a Putnam client is known to be a party, or
which transaction may have a significant relationship to any action
taken by a Putnam client.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

It shall be the responsibility of every Putnam employee to make inquiry
prior to any personal transaction sufficient to satisfy himself that the
requirements of this Rule have been met.

COMMENT

This rule is required by federal law. It does not prohibit a Putnam
employee from purchasing any shares of an open-end Putnam fund. The
policy with respect to employee trading in closed-end Putnam funds is
attached as Appendix B.

RULE 6

No Putnam employee shall engage in market timing strategies within
Putnam mutual funds, including within Putnam's Profit Sharing Retirement
Plan accounts and deferred compensation accounts.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

"Market timing" occurs when a person frequently purchases and sells
shares of mutual funds based upon the activity of equity markets on the
days that the purchases and sales are effected.  Putnam has determined
that market timing has  a detrimental effect on the performance of the
mutual funds managed by Putnam, and Putnam has taken steps to reduce
instances of market timing by brokers and shareholders in the mutual
funds.  Putnam therefore expects that Putnam employees will avoid making
frequent trades into and out of the Putnam mutual funds, including
transactions made within Putnam's Profit Sharing Retirement Plan and
other deferred compensation vehicles.

C. Discouraged Transactions

RULE 1

Putnam employees are strongly discouraged from engaging in naked option
transactions for their personal accounts.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

Naked option transactions are particularly dangerous, because a Putnam
employee may be prevented by the restrictions in this Code of Ethics
from "covering" the naked option at the appropriate time. All employees
should keep in mind the limitations on their personal securities trading
imposed by this Code when contemplating such an investment strategy.
Engaging in naked options transactions on the basis of material,
nonpublic information is prohibited. See Appendix A, Policy Statement
Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions.

RULE 2

Putnam employees are strongly discouraged from engaging in excessive
trading for their personal accounts.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. Although a Putnam employee's excessive trading may not itself constitute
   a conflict of interest with Putnam clients, Putnam believes that its
   clients' confidence in Putnam will be enhanced and the likelihood of
   Putnam achieving better investment results for its clients over the
   long term will be increased if Putnam employees rely on their investment
   -- as opposed to trading -- skills in transactions for their own account.
   Moreover, excessive trading by a Putnam employee for his or her own
   account diverts an employee's attention from the responsibility of
   servicing Putnam clients, and increases the possibilities for transactions
   that are in actual or apparent conflict with Putnam client transactions.

2. Although this Rule does not define excessive trading, employees should
   be aware that if their trades exceed 10 trades per quarter the trading
   activity will be reviewed by the Code of Ethics Oversight Committee.

D. Exempted Transactions

RULE 1

Transactions which are involuntary on the part of a Putnam employee are
exempt from the prohibitions set forth in Sections I.A., I.B., and I.C.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. This exemption is based on categories of conduct that the Securities and
   Exchange Commission does not consider "abusive."

2. Examples of involuntary personal securities transactions include:

(a) sales out of the brokerage account of a Putnam employee as a result
    of bona fide margin call, provided that withdrawal of collateral by the
    Putnam employee within the ten days previous to the margin call was not
    a contributing factor to the margin call;

(b) purchases arising out of an automatic dividend reinvestment program of
    an issuer of a publicly traded security.

3. Transactions by a trust in which the Putnam employee (or a member of
his immediate family) holds a beneficial interest, but for which the
employee has no direct or indirect influence or control with respect to
the selection of investments, are involuntary transactions. In addition,
these transactions do not fall within the definition of "personal
securities transactions." See Definitions.

4. A good-faith belief on the part of the employee that a transaction
was involuntary will not be a defense to a violation of the Code of
Ethics. In the event of confusion as to whether a particular transaction
is involuntary, the burden is on the employee to seek a prior written
determination of the applicability of this exemption. The procedures for
obtaining such a determination appear in Section VII, Part 3.

RULE 2

Transactions which have been determined in writing by the Code of Ethics
Officer before the transaction occurs to be no more than remotely
potentially harmful to Putnam clients because the transaction would be
very unlikely to affect a highly institutional market, or because the
transaction is clearly not related economically to the securities to be
purchased, sold, or held by a Putnam client, are exempt from the
prohibitions set forth in Sections I.A., I.B., and I.C.

EXCEPTIONS

N.A.

IMPLEMENTATION

An employee may seek an ad hoc exemption under this Rule by following
the procedures in Section VII, Part 4.

COMMENTS

1. This exemption is also based upon categories of conduct that the
   Securities and Exchange Commission does not consider "abusive."

2. The burden is on the employee to seek a prior written determination
   that the proposed transaction meets the standards for an ad hoc
   exemption set forth in this Rule.


* Section II. Additional Special Rules for Personal Securities
              Transactions of Access Persons and Certain Investment
              Professionals

Access Persons (including all Investment Professionals and other employees
as defined on page ix)

RULE 1 ("60-DAY" RULE)

No Access Person shall purchase and then sell at a profit, or sell and
then repurchase at a lower price, any security or related derivative
security within 60 calendar days.

EXCEPTIONS

None, unless prior written approval from the Code of Ethics Officer is
obtained. Exceptions may be granted on a case-by-case basis when no
abuse is involved and the equities of the situation support an
exemption. For example, although an Access Person may buy a stock as a
long-term investment, that stock may have to be sold involuntarily due
to unforeseen activity such as a merger.

IMPLEMENTATION

1. The 60-Day Rule applies to all Access Persons, as defined in the
   Definitions section of the Code.

2. Calculation of whether there has been a profit is based upon the
   market prices of the securities.  The calculation is not net of
   commissions or other sales charges.

3. As an example, an Access Person would not be permitted to sell a
   security at $12 that he purchased within the prior 60 days for $10.
   Similarly, an Access Person would not be permitted to purchase a
   security at $10 that she had sold within the prior 60 days for $12.
   If the proposed transaction would be made at a loss, it would be
   permitted if the pre-clearance requirements are met. See, Section I,
   Rule 1.

COMMENTS

1. The prohibition against short-term trading profits by Access Persons
   is designed to minimize the possibility that they will capitalize
   inappropriately on the market impact of trades involving a client
   portfolio about which they might possibly have information.

2. Although Chief Investment Officers, Portfolio Managers, and Analysts
   may sell securities at a profit within 60 days of purchase in order to
   comply with the requirements of the 7-Day Rule applicable to them
   (described below), the profit will have to be disgorged to charity
   under the terms of the 7-Day Rule.

3. Access Persons occasionally make a series of transactions in securities
   over extended periods of time. For example, an Access Person bought
   100 shares of Stock X on Day 1 at $100 per share and then bought 50
   additional shares on Day 45 at $95 per share. On Day 75, the Access
   Person sold 20 shares at $105 per share. The question arises whether
   the Access Person violated the 60-Day Rule. The characterization of
   the employee's tax basis in the shares sold determines the analysis.
   If, for personal income tax purposes, the Access Person characterizes
   the shares sold as having a basis of $100 per share (i.e., shares
   purchased on Day 1), the transaction would be consistent with the 60-Day
   Rule. However, if the tax basis in the shares is $95 per share (i.e.,
   shares purchased on Day 45), the transaction would violate the 60-Day Rule.

Certain Investment Professionals

RULE 2 ("7-DAY" RULE)

(a) Portfolio Managers: Before a portfolio manager (including a Chief
Investment Officer with respect to an account he manages) places an
order to buy a security for any Putnam client portfolio that he manages,
he shall sell any such security or related derivative security purchased
in a transaction for his personal account within the preceding seven
calendar days.

(b) Co-Managers: Before a portfolio manager places an order to buy a
security for any Putnam client he manages, his co-manager shall sell any
such security or related derivative security purchased in transaction
for his personal account within the preceding seven calendar days.

(c) Analysts: Before an analyst makes a buy recommendation for a
security (including designation of a security for inclusion in the
portfolio of the Putnam Research Fund), he shall sell any such security
or related derivative security purchased in a transaction for his
personal account within the preceding seven calendar days.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. This Rule applies to portfolio managers (including Chief Investment
Officers with respect to accounts they manage) in connection with any
purchase (no matter how small) in any client account managed by that
portfolio manager or CIO (even so-called "clone accounts").  In
particular, it should be noted that the requirements of this rule also
apply with respect to purchases in client accounts, including "clone
accounts," resulting from "cash flows."  To comply with the requirements
of this rule, it is the responsibility of each portfolio manager or CIO
to be aware of the placement of all orders for purchases of a security
by client accounts that he or she manages for 7 days following the
purchase of that security for his or her personal account.

2. An investment professional who must sell securities to be in
compliance with the   7-Day Rule must absorb any loss and disgorge to
charity any profit resulting from the sale.

3. This Rule is designed to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of
interest between an investment professional and a Putnam client. A more
stringent rule is warranted because, with their greater knowledge and
control, these investment professionals are in a better position than
other employees to create an appearance of manipulation of Putnam client
accounts for personal benefit.

4. "Portfolio manager" is used in this Section as a functional label,
and is intended to cover any employee with authority to authorize a
trade on behalf of a Putnam client, whether or not such employee bears
the title "portfolio manager." "Analyst" is also used in this Section as
a functional label, and is intended to cover any employee who is not a
portfolio manager but who may make recommendations regarding investments
for Putnam clients.

RULE 3 ("BLACKOUT RULE")

(a) Portfolio Managers: No portfolio manager (including a Chief
Investment Officer with respect to an account she manages) shall: (i)
sell any security or related derivative security for her personal
account until seven calendar days have elapsed since the most recent
purchase of that security or related derivative security by any Putnam
client portfolio she manages or co-manages; or (ii) purchase any
security or related derivative security for her personal account until
seven calendar days have elapsed since the most recent sale of that
security or related derivative security from any Putnam client portfolio
that she manages or co-manages.

(b) Analysts: No analyst shall: (i) sell any security or related
derivative security for his personal account until seven calendar days
have elapsed since his most recent buy recommendation for that security
or related derivative security (including designation of a security for
inclusion in the portfolio of the Putnam Research Fund); or (ii)
purchase any security or related derivative security for his personal
account until seven calendar days have elapsed since his most recent
sell recommendation for that security or related derivative security
(including the removal of a security from the portfolio of the Putnam
Research Fund).

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. This Rule applies to portfolio managers (including Chief Investment
Officers with respect to accounts they manage) in connection with to any
transaction (no matter how small) in any client account managed by that
portfolio manager or CIO (even so-called "clone accounts").  In
particular, it should be noted that the requirements of this rule also
apply with respect to transactions in client accounts, including "clone
accounts," resulting from "cash flows."  In order to comply with the
requirements of this rule, it is the responsibility of each portfolio
manager and CIO to be aware of all transactions in a security by client
accounts that he or she manages that took place within the 7 days
preceding a transaction in that security for his or her personal
account.

2. This Rule is designed to prevent a Putnam portfolio manager or
analyst from engaging in personal investment conduct that appears to be
counter to the investment strategy she is pursuing or recommending on
behalf of a Putnam client.

3. Trades by a Putnam portfolio manager for her personal account in the
"same direction" as the Putnam client portfolio she manages, and trades
by an analyst for his personal account in the "same direction" as his
recommendation, do not present the same danger, so long as any "same
direction" trades do not violate other provisions of the Code or the
Policy Statements.

RULE 4 ("CONTRA TRADING" RULE)

(a) Portfolio Managers: No portfolio manager shall, without prior
clearance, sell out of his personal account securities or related
derivative securities held in any Putnam client portfolio that he
manages or co-manages.

(b) Chief Investment Officers: No Chief Investment Officer shall,
without prior clearance, sell out of his personal account securities or
related derivative securities held in any Putnam client portfolio
managed in his investment group.

EXCEPTIONS

None, unless prior clearance is given.

IMPLEMENTATION

A. Individuals Authorized to Give Approval. Prior to engaging in any
   such sale, a portfolio manager shall seek approval, in writing, of the
   proposed sale. In the case of a portfolio manager or director, prior
   written approval of the proposed sale shall be obtained from a Chief
   Investment Officer to whom he reports or, in his absence, another Chief
   Investment Officer. In the case of a Chief Investment Officer, prior
   written approval of the proposed sale shall be obtained from another
   Chief Investment Officer. In addition to the foregoing, prior written
   approval must also be obtained from the Code of Ethics Officer.

B. Contents of Written Approval. In every instance, the written approval
   form attached as Appendix C (or such other form as the Code of Ethics
   Officer shall designate) shall be used. The written approval should be
   signed by the Chief Investment Officer giving approval and dated the
   date such approval was given, and shall state, briefly, the reasons why
   the trade was allowed and why the investment conduct pursued by the
   portfolio manager, director, or chief investment officer was deemed
   inappropriate for the Putnam client account controlled by the individual
   seeking to engage in the transaction for his personal account. Such
   written approval shall be sent by the Chief Investment Officer approving
   the transaction to the Code of Ethics Officer within twenty-four hours
   or as promptly as circumstances permit. Approvals obtained after a
   transaction has been completed or while it is in process will not
   satisfy the requirements of this Rule.

COMMENT

This Rule, like Rule 3 of this Section, is designed to prevent a Putnam
portfolio manager from engaging in personal investment conduct that
appears to be counter to the investment strategy that he is pursuing on
behalf of a Putnam client.

RULE 5

No portfolio manager shall cause, and no analyst shall recommend, a
Putnam client to take action for the portfolio manager's or analyst's
own personal benefit.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. A portfolio manager who trades in, or an analyst who recommends,
   particular securities for a Putnam client account in order to support
   the price of securities in his personal account, or who "front runs" a
   Putnam client order is in violation of this Rule. Portfolio managers
   and analysts should be aware that this Rule is not limited to personal
   transactions in securities (as that word is defined in "Definitions").
   Thus, a portfolio manager or analyst who "front runs" a Putnam client
   purchase or sale of obligations of the U.S. government is in violation
   of this Rule, although U.S. government obligations are excluded from
   the definition of "security."

2. This Rule is not limited to instances when a portfolio manager or
   analyst has malicious intent. It also prohibits conduct that creates an
   appearance of impropriety. Portfolio managers and analysts who have
   questions about whether proposed conduct creates an appearance of
   impropriety should seek a prior written determination from the Code of
   Ethics Officer, using the procedures described in Section VII, Part 3.


* Section III.   Prohibited Conduct for All Employees

RULE 1

All employees must comply with applicable laws and regulations as well
as company policies. This includes tax, antitrust, political
contribution, and international boycott  laws.  In addition, no employee
at Putnam may engage in fraudulent conduct of any kind.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. Putnam may report to the appropriate legal authorities conduct by
   Putnam employees that violates this rule.

2. It should also be noted that the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
   makes it a criminal offense to make a payment or offer of payment to
   any non-U.S. governmental official, political party, or candidate to
   induce that person to affect any governmental act or decision, or to
   assist Putnam's obtaining or retaining business.

RULE 2

No Putnam employee shall conduct herself in a manner which is contrary
to the interests of, or in competition with, Putnam or a Putnam client,
or which creates an actual or apparent conflict of interest with a
Putnam client.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. This Rule is designed to recognize the fundamental principle that Putnam
   employees owe their chief duty and loyalty to Putnam and Putnam clients.

2. It is expected that a Putnam employee who becomes aware of an investment
   opportunity that she believes is suitable for a Putnam client who she
   services will present it to the appropriate portfolio manager, prior to
   taking advantage of the opportunity herself.

RULE 3

No Putnam employee shall seek or accept gifts, favors, preferential
treatment, or special arrangements of material value from any
broker-dealer, investment adviser, financial institution, corporation,
or other entity, or from any existing or prospective supplier of goods
or services to Putnam or Putnam Funds. Specifically, any gift over $100
in value, or any accumulation of gifts which in aggregate exceeds $100
in value from one source in one calendar year, is prohibited. Any Putnam
employee who is offered or receives an item prohibited by this Rule must
report the details in writing to the Code of Ethics Officer.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. This rule is intended to permit only proper types of customary business
   amenities. Listed below are examples of items that would be permitted
   under proper circumstances and of items that are prohibited under this
   rule. These examples are illustrative and not all-inclusive.
   Notwithstanding these examples, a Putnam employee may not, under any
   circumstances, accept anything that could create the appearance of any
   kind of conflict of interest. For example, acceptance of any
   consideration is prohibited if it would create the appearance of a
   "reward" or inducement for conducting Putnam business either with the
   person providing the gift or his employer.

2. This rule also applies to gifts or "favors" of material value that an
   investment professional may receive from a company or other entity being
   researched or considered as a possible investment for a Putnam client
   account.

3. Among items not considered of "material value" which, under proper
   circumstances, would be considered permissible are:

(a) Occasional lunches or dinners conducted for business purposes;

(b) Occasional cocktail parties or similar social gatherings conducted for
    business purposes;

(c) Occasional attendance at theater, sporting or other entertainment events
    conducted for business purposes; and

(d) Small gifts, usually in the nature of reminder advertising, such as pens,
    calendars, etc., with a value of no more than $100.

4. Among items which are considered of "material value" and which are
   prohibited are:

(a) Entertainment of a recurring nature such as sporting events, theater,
    golf games, etc.;

(b) The cost of transportation to a locality outside the Boston metropolitan
    area, and lodging while in another locality, unless such attendance and
    reimbursement arrangements have received advance written approval of the
    Code of Ethics Officer;

(c) Personal loans to a Putnam employee on terms more favorable than those
    generally available for comparable credit standing and collateral; and

(d) Preferential brokerage or underwriting commissions or spreads or
    allocations of shares or interests in an investment for the personal
    account of a Putnam employee.

5. As with any of the provisions of the Code of Ethics, a sincere belief by
   the employee that he was acting in accordance with the requirements of
   this Rule will not satisfy his obligations under the Rule. Therefore, an
   employee who is in doubt concerning the propriety of any gift or "favor"
   should seek a prior written determination from the Code of Ethics Officer,
   as provided in Part 3 of Section VII.

RULE 4

No Putnam employee may pay, offer, or commit to pay any amount of
consideration which might be or appear to be a bribe or kickback in
connection with Putnam's business.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

Although the rule does not specifically address political contributions,
Putnam employees should be aware that it is against corporate policy to
use company assets to fund political contributions of any sort, even
where such contributions may be legal. No Putnam employee should offer
or agree to make any political contributions (including political
dinners and similar fund-raisers) on behalf of Putnam, and no employee
will be reimbursed by Putnam for such contributions made by the employee
personally.

RULE 5

No contributions may be made with corporate funds to any political party
or campaign, whether directly or by reimbursement to an employee for the
expense of such a contribution. No Putnam employee shall solicit any
charitable, political or other contributions using Putnam letterhead or
making reference to Putnam in the solicitation. No Putnam employee shall
personally solicit any such contribution while on Putnam business.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

1. Putnam has established a political action committee (PAC) that contributes
   to worthy candidates for political office. Any request received by a
   Putnam employee for a political contribution must be directed to Putnam's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

2. This rule does not prohibit solicitation on personal letterhead by Putnam
   employees. Nonetheless, Putnam employees should use discretion in
   soliciting contributions from individuals or entities who provide services
   to Putnam. There should never be a suggestion that any service provider
   must contribute to keep Putnam's business.

RULE 6

No unauthorized disclosure may be made by any employee or former
employee of any trade secrets or proprietary information of Putnam or of
any confidential information. No information regarding any Putnam client
portfolio, actual or proposed securities trading activities of any
Putnam client, or Putnam research shall be disclosed outside the Putnam
organization without a valid business purpose.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

All information about Putnam and Putnam clients is strictly
confidential. Putnam research information should not be disclosed
unnecessarily and never for personal gain.

RULE 7

No Putnam employee shall serve as officer, employee, director, trustee
or general partner of a corporation or entity other than Putnam, without
prior approval of the Code of Ethics Officer.

EXCEPTION

Charitable or Non-profit Exception. This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as officer, director, or trustee of a
charitable or not-for-profit institution, provided that the employee
abides by the spirit of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements
with respect to any investment activity for which she has any discretion
or input as officer, director, or trustee.  The pre-clearance and
reporting requirements of the Code of Ethics do not apply to the trading
activities of such charitable or not-for-profit institutions for which
an employee serves as an officer, director, or trustee.

COMMENTS

1. This Rule is designed to ensure that Putnam cannot be deemed an affiliate
   of any issuer of securities by virtue of service by one of its officers
   or employees as director or trustee.

2. Certain charitable or not-for-profit institutions have assets (such as
   endowment funds or employee benefit plans) which require prudent
   investment. To the extent that a Putnam employee (because of her position
   as officer, director, or trustee of an outside entity) is charged with
   responsibility to invest such assets prudently, she may not be able to
   discharge that duty while simultaneously abiding by the spirit of the
   Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements. Employees are cautioned that
   they should not accept service as an officer, director, or trustee of an
   outside charitable or not-for-profit entity where such investment
   responsibility is involved, without seriously considering their ability
   to discharge their fiduciary duties with respect to such investments.

RULE 8

No Putnam employee shall serve as a trustee, executor, custodian, any
other fiduciary, or as an investment adviser or counselor for any
account outside Putnam.

EXCEPTIONS

Charitable or Religious Exception. This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as fiduciary with respect to a religious or
charitable trust or foundation, so long as the employee abides by the
spirit of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements with respect to
any investment activity over which he has any discretion or input.  The
pre-clearance and reporting requirements of the Code of Ethics do not
apply to the trading activities of such a religious or charitable trust
or foundation.

Family Trust or Estate Exception.  This Rule shall not prevent any
Putnam employee from serving as fiduciary with respect to a family trust
or estate, so long as the employee abides by all of the Rules of the
Code of Ethics with respect to any investment activity over which he has
any discretion.

COMMENT

The roles permissible under this Rule may carry with them the obligation
to invest assets prudently. Once again, Putnam employees are cautioned
that they may not be able to fulfill their duties in that respect while
abiding by the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements.

RULE 9

No Putnam employee may be a member of any investment club.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

This Rule guards against the danger that a Putnam employee may be in
violation of the Code of Ethics and the Policy Statements by virtue of
his personal securities transactions in or through an entity that is not
bound by the restrictions imposed by this Code of Ethics and the Policy
Statements.  Please note that this restriction also applies to the
spouse of a Putnam employee and any relatives of a Putnam employee
living in the same household as the employee, as their transactions are
covered by the Code of Ethics (see page x).

RULE 10

No Putnam employee may become involved in a personal capacity in
consultations or negotiations for corporate financing, acquisitions or
other transactions for outside companies (whether or not held by any
Putnam client), nor negotiate nor accept a fee in connection with these
activities without obtaining the prior written permission of the
president of Putnam Investments.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

RULE 11

No new types of securities or instruments may be purchased for a Putnam
fund or other client account without following the procedures set forth
in Appendix D.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

See Appendix D.

RULE 12

No employee may create or participate in the creation of any record that
is intended to mislead anyone or to conceal anything that is improper.
In addition, all employees responsible for the preparation, filing, or
distribution of any regulatory filings or public communications must
ensure that such filings or communications are timely, complete, fair,
accurate, and understandable.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENTS

1. In many cases, this is not only a matter of company policy and ethical
   behavior but also required by law. Our books and records must accurately
   reflect the transactions represented and their true nature. For example,
   records must be accurate as to the recipient of all payments; expense
   items, including personal expense reports, must accurately reflect the
   true nature of the expense. No unrecorded fund or asset shall be
   established or maintained for any reason.

2. All financial books and records must be prepared and maintained in
   accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and Putnam's
   existing accounting controls, to the extent applicable.

RULE 13

No employee should have any direct or indirect (including by a family
member or close relative) personal financial interest (other than normal
investments not material to the employee in the entity's publicly traded
securities) in any business, with which Putnam has dealings unless such
interest is disclosed and approved by the Code of Ethics Officer.

RULE 14

No employee shall, with respect to any affiliate of Putnam that provides
investment advisory services and is listed below in Comment 4 to this
Rule, as revised from time to time (each an "NPA"),

(a) directly or indirectly seek to influence the purchase, retention, or
disposition of, or exercise of voting, consent, approval or similar
rights with respect to, any portfolio security in any account or fund
advised by the NPA and not by Putnam,

(b) transmit any information regarding the purchase, retention or
disposition of, or exercise of voting, consent, approval or similar
rights with respect to, any portfolio security held in a Putnam or NPA
client account to any personnel of the NPA,

(c) transmit any trade secrets, proprietary information, or confidential
information of Putnam to the NPA without a valid business purpose,

(d) use confidential information or trade secrets of the NPA for the
benefit of the employee, Putnam, or any other NPA, or

(e) breach any duty of loyalty to the NPA by virtue of service as a
director or officer of the NPA.

COMMENTS

1. Sections (a) and (b) of the Rule are designed to help ensure that the
   portfolio holdings of Putnam clients and clients of the NPA need not be
   aggregated for purposes of determining beneficial ownership under
   Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act or applicable regulatory
   or contractual investment restrictions that incorporate such definition
   of beneficial ownership. Persons who serve as directors or officers of
   both Putnam and an NPA would take care to avoid even inadvertent
   violations of Section (b). Section (a) does not prohibit a Putnam
   employee who serves as a director or officer of the NPA from seeking
   to influence the modification or termination of a particular investment
   product or strategy in a manner that is not directed at any specific
   securities. Sections (a) and (b) do not apply when a Putnam affiliate
   serves as an adviser or subadviser to the NPA or one of its products,
   in which case normal Putnam aggregation rules apply.

2. As a separate entity, any NPA may have trade secrets or confidential
   information that it would not choose to share with Putnam. This choice
   must be respected.

3. When Putnam employees serve as directors or officers of an NPA, they are
   subject to common law duties of loyalty to the NPA, despite their Putnam
   employment. In general, this means that when performing their duties as
   NPA directors or officers, they must act in the best interest of the NPA
   and its shareholders. Putnam's Legal and Compliance Department will assist
   any Putnam employee who is a director or officer of an NPA and has
   questions about the scope of his or her responsibilities to the NPA.

4. Entities that are currently non-Putnam affiliates within the scope of this
   Rule are: Cisalpina Gestioni, S.p.A., PanAgora Asset Management Inc.,
   PanAgora Asset Management Ltd., Nissay Asset Management Co., Ltd.,
   Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P., Ampega Asset Management, GMBH, and Sceptre
   Investment Counsel, Ltd.

RULE 15

No employee shall use computer hardware, software, data, Internet,
electronic mail, voice mail, electronic messaging ("e-mail" or "cc:
Mail"), or telephone communications systems in a manner that is
inconsistent with their use as set forth in policy statements governing
their use that are adopted from time to time by Putnam. No employee
shall introduce a computer "virus" or computer code that may result in
damage to Putnam's information or computer systems.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

Putnam's policy statements relating to these matters are contained in
the "Computer System and Network Responsibilities" section of the
"Employment Issues" category within the Employee Handbook.  The on-line
Employee Handbook is located in the Putnam ibenefitcenter
(https://www.ibenefitcenter.com) at the "Policies and Procedures"
section of the "Workplace Community" tab.

RULE 16

All employees must follow and abide by the spirit of the Code of Ethics
and the Standards of Professional Conduct of the Association of
Investment Management and Research (AIMR).  The texts of the AIMR Code
of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct are set forth in Exhibit
E.

RULE 17

Except as provided below, no employee may disclose to any outside
organization or person any non-public personal information about any
individual who is a current or former shareholder of any Putnam retail
or institutional fund, or current or former client of a Putnam company.
All employees shall follow the security procedures as established from
time to time by a Putnam company to protect the confidentiality of all
shareholder and client account information.

Except as Putnam's Legal and Compliance Department may expressly
authorize, no employee shall collect any non-public personal information
about a prospective or current shareholder of a Putnam Fund or
prospective or current client of a Putnam company, other than through an
account application (or corresponding information provided by the
shareholder's financial representative) or in connection with executing
shareholder or client transactions, nor shall any information be
collected other than the following:  name, address, telephone number,
social security number, and investment, broker, and transaction
information.

EXCEPTIONS

Putnam Employees.  Non-public personal information may be disclosed to
Putnam employees in connection with processing transactions or
maintaining accounts for shareholders of a Putnam fund and clients of a
Putnam company, to the extent that access to such information is
necessary to the performance of that employee's job functions.

Shareholder Consent Exception.  Non-public personal information about a
shareholder's or client's account may be provided to a non-Putnam
organization at the specific request of the shareholder or client or
with the shareholder's or client's prior written consent.

Broker or Adviser Exception.  Non-public personal information about a
shareholder's or client's account may be provided to the shareholder's
or client's broker of record.

Third Party Service Provider Exception.  Non-public personal information
may be disclosed to a service provider that is not affiliated with a
Putnam fund or Putnam company only when such disclosure is necessary for
the service provider to perform the specific services contracted for,
and only (a) if the service provider executes Putnam's standard
confidentiality agreement, or (b) pursuant to an agreement containing a
confidentiality provision that has been approved by the Legal and
Compliance Department.  Examples of such service providers include proxy
solicitors and proxy vote tabulators, mail services and providers of
other administrative services, and Information Services Division
consultants who have access to non-public personal information.

COMMENTS

1. Non-public personal information is any information that personally
   identifies a shareholder of a Putnam fund or client of a Putnam company
   and is not derived from publicly available sources.  This privacy policy
   applies to shareholders or clients that are individuals, not institutions.
   However, as a general matter, all information that we receive about a
   shareholder of a Putnam fund or client of a Putnam company shall be
   treated as confidential.  No employee may sell or otherwise provide
   shareholder or client lists or any other information relating to a
   shareholder or client to any marketing organization.2.   All Putnam
   employees with access to shareholder or client account information must
   be trained in and follow Putnam's security procedures designed to
   safeguard that information from unauthorized use.  For example, a
   telephone representative must be trained in and follow Putnam's security
   procedures to verify the identity of a caller requesting account
   information.

3. Any questions regarding this privacy policy should be directed to Putnam's
   Legal and Compliance Department.  A violation of this policy will be subject
   to the sanctions imposed for violations of Putnam's Code of Ethics.

4. Employees must report any violation of this policy or any possible breach
   of the confidentiality of client information (whether intentional or
   accidental) to the Managing Director in charge of the employee's business
   unit.  Managing Directors who are notified of such a violation or possible
   breach must immediately report it in writing to Putnam's General Counsel
   and, in the event of a breach of computerized data, Putnam's Chief
   Technology Officer.

RULE 18

No employee may engage in any money laundering activity or facilitate
any money-laundering activity through the use of any Putnam account or
client account.  Any situations giving rise to a suspicion that
attempted money laundering may be occurring in any account must be
reported immediately to the Managing Director in charge of the
employee's business unit.  Managing Directors who are notified of such a
suspicion of money laundering activity must immediately report it in
writing to Putnam's General Counsel and Chief Financial Officer.

RULE 19

All employees must comply with the record retention requirements
applicable to the business unit.

COMMENT

Employees should check with their managers or the Chief Administrative
Officer of their division to determine what record retention
requirements apply to their business unit.


* Section IV.   Special Rules for Officers and Employees of Putnam
                Investments Limited
RULE 1

In situations subject to Section I.A., Rule 1 (Restricted List Personal
Securities Transactions), the Putnam Investments Limited. ("PIL") employee
must obtain clearance not only as provided in that rule, but also from PIL's
Compliance Officer or her designee, who must approve the transaction before
any trade is placed and record the approval.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

Putnam's Code of Ethics Administrator in Boston (the "Boston
Administrator") has also been designated the Assistant Compliance
Officer of PIL and has been delegated the right to approve or disapprove
personal securities transactions in accordance with the foregoing
requirement. Therefore, approval from the Code of Ethics Administrator
for PIL employees to make personal securities investments constitutes
approval under the Code of Ethics and also for purposes of compliance
with IMRO, the U.K. self-regulatory organization that regulates PIL.

The position of London Code of Ethics Administrator (the "London
Administrator") has also been created (Jane Barlow is the current London
Administrator). All requests for clearances must be made by e-mail to
the Boston Administrator copying the London Administrator. The e-mail
must include the number of shares to be bought or sold and the name of
the broker(s) involved. Where time is of the essence clearances can be
made by telephone to the Boston Administrator but they must be followed
up by e-mail.

Both the Boston and London Administrators will maintain copies of all
clearances for inspection by senior management and regulators.

RULE 2

No PIL employee may trade with any broker or dealer unless that broker
or dealer has sent a letter to the London Administrator agreeing to
deliver copies of trade confirmations to PIL. No PIL employee may enter
into any margin or any other special dealing arrangement with any
broker-dealer without the prior written consent of the PIL Compliance
Officer.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

PIL employees will be notified separately of this requirement once a
year by the PIL Compliance Officer, and are required to provide an
annual certification of compliance with the Rule.

All PIL employees must inform the London Administrator of the names of
all brokers and dealers with whom they trade prior to trading. The
London Administrator will send a letter to the broker(s) in question
requesting them to agree to deliver copies of confirms to PIL. The
London Administrator will forward copies of the confirms to the Boston
Administrator. PIL employees may trade with a broker only when the
London Administrator has received the signed agreement from that broker.

RULE 3

For purposes of the Code of Ethics, including Putnam's Policy Statement
on Insider Trading Prohibitions, PIL employees must also comply with
Part V of the Criminal Justice Act 1993 on insider dealing.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

To ensure compliance with U.K. insider dealing legislation, PIL
employees must observe the relevant procedures set forth in PIL's
Compliance Manual, a copy of which is sent to each PIL employee, and
sign an annual certification as to compliance.


* Section V.   Reporting Requirements for All Employees

Reporting of Personal Securities Transactions

RULE 1

Each Putnam employee shall ensure that broker-dealers send all
confirmations of securities transactions for his personal accounts to
the Code of Ethics Officer. (For the purpose of this Rule, "securities"
shall include securities of The Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., and
any option on a security or securities index, including broad-based
market indexes.)

EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

1. Putnam employees must instruct their broker-dealers to send
   confirmations to Putnam and must follow up with the broker-dealer
   on a reasonable basis to ensure that the instructions are being
   followed. Putnam employees should contact the Code of Ethics
   Administrator to obtain a letter from Putnam authorizing the setting
   up of a personal brokerage account. Confirmations should be submitted
   to the Code of Ethics Administrator. (Specific procedures apply to
   employees of Putnam Investments Limited ("PIL"). Employees of PIL
   should contact the London Code of Ethics Administrator.) Failure of a
   broker-dealer to comply with the instructions of a Putnam employee to
   send confirmations shall be a violation by the Putnam employee of this
   Rule.

COMMENTS

1. "Transactions for personal accounts" is defined broadly to include more
   than transaction in accounts under an employee's own name. See Definitions.

2. A confirmation is required for all personal securities transactions,
   whether or not exempted or excepted by this Code.

3. To the extent that a Putnam employee has investment authority over
   securities transactions of a family trust or estate, confirmations of
   those transactions must also be made, unless the employee has received a
   prior written exception from the Code of Ethics Officer.

RULE 2

Every Access Person shall file a quarterly report, within ten calendar
days of the end of each quarter, recording all purchases and sales of
any securities for personal accounts as defined in the Definitions. (For
the purpose of this Rule, "securities" shall include any option on a
security or securities index, including broad-based market indexes.)

EXCEPTIONS

None.

IMPLEMENTATION

All employees required to file such a report will receive by e-mail a
blank form at the end of the quarter from the Code of Ethics
Administrator. The form will specify the information to be reported. The
form shall also contain a representation that employees have complied
fully with all provisions of the Code of Ethics.

COMMENT

1. The date for each transaction required to be disclosed in the quarterly
   report is the trade date for the transaction, not the settlement date.

2. If the requirement to file a quarterly report applies to you and you
   fail to report within the required 10-day period, salary increases and
   bonuses will be reduced in accordance with guidelines stated in the form.

Reporting of Personal Securities Holdings

RULE 3

Access Persons must disclose all personal securities holdings to the
Code of Ethics Officer upon commencement of employment and thereafter on
an annual basis.

EXCEPTIONS

None.

COMMENT

These requirements are mandated by SEC regulations and are designed to
facilitate the monitoring of personal securities transactions.  Putnam's
Code of Ethics Administrator will provide Access Persons with the form
for making these reports and the specific information that must be
disclosed at the time that the disclosure is required.

Other Reporting Policies

The following rules are designed to ensure that Putnam's internal
Control and Reporting professionals are aware of all items that might
need to be addressed by Putnam or reported to appropriate entities.

RULE 4

If a Putnam employee suspects that fraudulent or other irregular
activity might be occurring at Putnam, the activity must be reported
immediately to the Managing Director in charge of that employee's
business unit.  Managing Directors who are notified of any such activity
must immediately report it in writing to Putnam's Chief Financial
Officer or Putnam's General Counsel.


RULE 5

Putnam employees must report all communications from regulatory or
government agencies (federal, state, or local) to the Managing Director
in charge of their business unit.  Managing Directors who are notified
of any such communication must immediately report it in writing to
Putnam's Chief Financial Officer or Putnam's General Counsel.

RULE 6

All claims, circumstances or situations that could give rise to a claim
against Putnam that come to the attention of a Putnam employee must be
reported through the employee's management structure up to the Managing
Director in charge of the employee's business unit.  Managing Directors
who are notified of any such claim, circumstance or situation that might
give rise to a claim against Putnam for more than $100,000 must
immediately report in writing it to Putnam's Chief Financial Officer or
Putnam's General Counsel.

RULE 7

All possible violations of law or regulations at Putnam that come to the
attention of a Putnam employee must be reported immediately to the
Managing Director in charge of the employee's business unit.  Managing
Directors who are notified of any such activity must immediately report
it in writing to Putnam's Chief Financial Officer or Putnam's General
Counsel.

RULE 8

Putnam employees must report all requests by anyone for Putnam to
participate in or cooperate with an international boycott to the
Managing Director in charge of their business unit.  Managing Directors
who are notified of any such request must immediately report it in
writing to Putnam's Chief Financial Officer or Putnam's General Counsel.

RULE 9

If a Putnam employee believes that there has been a violation of any of
the rules of the Code of Ethics, that employee must promptly notify the
Code of Ethics Officer, Bill Woolverton, or the Deputy Code of Ethics
Officer, Andy Hachey, of the violation.


* Section VI.   Education Requirements

Every Putnam employee has an obligation to fully understand the
requirements of the Code of Ethics. The Rules set forth below are
designed to enhance this understanding.

RULE 1

A copy of the Code of Ethics will be distributed to every Putnam
employee periodically.  All Access Persons will be required to certify
periodically that they have read, understood, and will comply with the
provisions of the Code of Ethics, including the Code's Policy Statement
Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions.

RULE 2

Every investment professional will attend a meeting periodically at
which the Code of Ethics will be reviewed.


* Section VII.   Compliance and Appeal Procedures

1. Assembly of Restricted List. The Code of Ethics Administrator will
   coordinate the assembly and maintenance of the Restricted List. The
   list will be assembled each day by 11:30 a.m. EST.  No employee may
   engage in a personal securities transaction without prior clearance
   on any day, even if the employee believes that the trade will be
   subject to an exception.  Note that pre-clearance may be obtained
   after 9:00 a.m. for purchases or sales of up to 1,000 shares of
   issuers having a market capitalization in excess of $5 billion.

2. Consultation of Restricted List. It is the responsibility of each
   employee to pre-clear through the pre-clearance system or consult
   with the Code of Ethics Administrator prior to engaging in a personal
   securities transaction, to determine if the security he proposes to
   trade is on the Restricted List and, if so, whether it is subject to
   the "Large Cap" limitation.  The pre-clearance system and the Code of
   Ethics Administrator will be able to tell an employee whether a security
   is on the Restricted List.  No other information about the Restricted
   List is available through the pre-clearance system.  The Code of Ethics
   Administrator shall not be authorized to answer any questions about the
   Restricted List, or to render an opinion about the propriety of a
   particular personal securities transaction. Any such questions shall be
   directed to the Code of Ethics Officer.

3. Request for Determination. An employee who has a question concerning the
   applicability of the Code of Ethics to a particular situation shall
   request a determination from the Code of Ethics Officer before engaging
   in the conduct or personal securities transaction about which he has a
   question.

   If the question pertains to a personal securities transaction, the request
   shall state for whose account the transaction is proposed, the relationship
   of that account to the employee, the security proposed to be traded, the
   proposed price and quantity, the entity with whom the transaction will
   take place (if known), and any other information or circumstances of the
   trade that could have a bearing on the Code of Ethics Officer's
   determination. If the question pertains to other conduct, the request for
   determination shall give sufficient information about the proposed conduct
   to assist the Code of Ethics Officer in ascertaining the applicability of
   the Code. In every instance, the Code of Ethics Officer may request
   additional information, and may decline to render a determination if the
   information provided is insufficient.

   The Code of Ethics Officer shall make every effort to render a determination
   promptly.

   No perceived ambiguity in the Code of Ethics shall excuse any violation.
   Any person who believes the Code to be ambiguous in a particular situation
   shall request a determination from the Code of Ethics Officer.

4. Request for Ad Hoc Exemption. Any employee who wishes to obtain an ad hoc
   exemption under Section I.D., Rule 2, shall request from the Code of Ethics
   Officer an exemption in writing in advance of the conduct or transaction
   sought to be exempted. In the case of a personal securities transaction,
   the request for an ad hoc exemption shall give the same information about
   the transaction required in a request for determination under Part 3 of
   this Section, and shall state why the proposed personal securities
   transaction would be unlikely to affect a highly institutional market, or
   is unrelated economically to securities to be purchased, sold, or held by
   any Putnam client. In the case of other conduct, the request shall give
   information sufficient for the Code of Ethics Officer to ascertain whether
   the conduct raises questions of propriety or conflict of interest (real or
   apparent).

   The Code of Ethics Officer shall make every effort to promptly render a
   written determination concerning the request for an ad hoc exemption.

5. Appeal to Code of Ethics Officer with Respect to Restricted List. If an
   employee ascertains that a security that he wishes to trade for his
   personal account appears on the Restricted List, and thus the transaction
   is prohibited, he may appeal the prohibition to the Code of Ethics Officer
   by submitting a written memorandum containing the same information as would
   be required in a request for a determination. The Code of Ethics Officer
   shall make every effort to respond to the appeal promptly.

6. Information Concerning Identity of Compliance Personnel. The names of Code
   of Ethics personnel are available by contacting the Legal and Compliance
   Department.



Appendix A

Policy Statement Concerning Insider Trading Prohibitions


PUTNAM INVESTMENTS

[SCALE LOGO OMITTED]


* Preamble

Putnam has always forbidden trading on material nonpublic information
("inside information") by its employees. Tougher federal laws make it
important for Putnam to restate that prohibition in the strongest
possible terms, and to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures to prevent the misuse of material nonpublic information.

Unlawful trading while in possession of inside information can be a
crime. Today, federal law provides that an individual convicted of
trading on inside information go to jail for some period of time. There
is also significant monetary liability for an inside trader; the
Securities and Exchange Commission can seek a court order requiring a
violator to pay back profits and penalties of up to three times those
profits. In addition, private plaintiffs can seek recovery for harm
suffered by them. The inside trader is not the only one subject to
liability. In certain cases, "controlling persons" of inside traders
(including supervisors of inside traders or Putnam itself) can be liable
for large penalties.

Section 1 of this Policy Statement contains rules concerning inside
information. Section 2 contains a discussion of what constitutes
unlawful insider trading.

Neither material nonpublic information nor unlawful insider trading is
easy to define. Section 2 of this Policy Statement gives a general
overview of the law in this area. However, the legal issues are complex
and must be resolved by the Code of Ethics Officer. If an employee has
any doubt as to whether she has received material nonpublic information,
she must consult with the Code of Ethics Officer prior to using that
information in connection with the purchase or sale of a security for
his own account or the account of any Putnam client, or communicating
the information to others. A simple rule of thumb is if you think the
information is not available to the public at large, don't disclose it
to others and don't trade securities to which the inside information
relates. If an employee has failed to consult the Code of Ethics
Officer, Putnam will not excuse employee misuse of inside information on
the ground that the employee claims to have been confused about this
Policy Statement or the nature of the information in his possession.

If Putnam determines, in its sole discretion, that an employee has
failed to abide by this Policy Statement, or has engaged in conduct that
raises a significant question concerning insider trading, he will be
subject to disciplinary action, including termination of employment.

THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS POLICY STATEMENT AND NO ONE IS EXEMPT.

Ethics Officer to assume responsibility for day-to-day,
non-discretionary administration of this Policy Statement.

Code of Ethics Officer. The Putnam officer who has been assigned the
responsibility of enforcing and interpreting this Policy Statement. The

of Putnam.

Putnam employee (or "employee"). Any employee of Putnam.

Security. Anything defined as a security under federal law. The term
includes any type of equity or debt security, any interest in a business
trust or partnership, and any rights relating to a security, such as put
and call options, warrants, convertible securities, and securities
indices. (Note: The definition of "security" in this Policy Statement
varies significantly from that in the Code of Ethics. For example, the
definition in this Policy Statement specifically includes securities of
The Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.)

Transaction for a personal account (or "personal securities
transaction"). Securities transactions: (a) for the personal account of
any employee; (b) for the account of a member of the immediate family of
any employee; (c) for the account of a partnership in which a Putnam
employee or immediate family member is a partner with investment
discretion; (d) for the account of a trust in which a Putnam employee or
immediate family member is a trustee with investment discretion; (e) for
the account of a closely-held corporation in which a Putnam employee or
immediate family member holds shares and for which he has investment
discretion; and (f) for any account other than a Putnam client account
which receives investment advice of any sort from the employee or
immediate family member, or as to which the employee or immediate family
member has investment discretion.

Officers and employees of Putnam Investments Limited ("PIL") must also
consult the relevant procedures on compliance with U.K. insider dealing
legislation set forth in PEL's Compliance Manual (see Rule 3 of Section
IV of the Code of Ethics).


* Section 1.   Rules Concerning Inside Information

RULE 1

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security listed on the
Inside Information List (the "Red List") either for his personal account
or for a Putnam client.

IMPLEMENTATION

When an employee contacts the Code of Ethics Administrator seeking
clearance for a personal securities transaction, the Code of Ethics
Administrator's response as to whether a security appears on the
Restricted List will include securities on the Red List.

COMMENT

This Rule is designed to prohibit any employee from trading a security
while Putnam may have inside information concerning that security or the
issuer. Every trade, whether for a personal account or for a Putnam
client, is subject to this Rule.

RULE 2

No Putnam employee shall purchase or sell any security, either for a
personal account or for the account of a Putnam client, while in
possession of material, nonpublic information concerning that security
or the issuer, without the prior written approval of the Code of Ethics
Officer.

IMPLEMENTATION

In order to obtain prior written approval of the Code of Ethics Officer,
a Putnam employee should follow the reporting steps prescribed in Rule
3.

COMMENTS

1. Rule 1 concerns the conduct of an employee when Putnam possesses
   material nonpublic information. Rule 2 concerns the conduct of an
   employee who herself possesses material, nonpublic information about
   a security that is not yet on the Red List.

2. If an employee has any question as to whether information she possesses
   is material and/or nonpublic information, she must contact the Code of
   Ethics Officer in accordance with Rule 3 prior to purchasing or selling
   any security related to the information or communicating the information
   to others. The Code of Ethics Officer shall have the sole authority to
   determine what constitutes material, nonpublic information for the
   purposes of this Policy Statement. An employee's mistaken belief that
   the information was not material nonpublic information will not excuse a
   violation of this Policy Statement.

RULE 3

Any Putnam employee who believes he may have received material,
nonpublic information concerning a security or the issuer shall
immediately report the information to the Code of Ethics Officer and to
no one else. After reporting the information, the Putnam employee shall
comply strictly with Rule 2 by not trading in the security without the
prior written approval of the Code of Ethics Officer and shall: (a) take
precautions to ensure the continued confidentiality of the information;
and (b) refrain from communicating the information in question to any
person.

EXCEPTION

This rule shall not apply to material, nonpublic information obtained by
Putnam employees who are directors or trustees of publicly traded
companies, to the extent that such information is received in their
capacities as directors or trustees, and then only to the extent such
information is not communicated to anyone else within the Putnam
organization.

IMPLEMENTATION

1. In order to make any use of potential material, nonpublic information,
   including purchasing or selling a security or communicating the
   information to others, an employee must communicate that information
   to the Code of Ethics Officer in a way designed to prevent the spread
   of such information. Once the employee has reported potential material,
   nonpublic information to the Code of Ethics Officer, the Code of Ethics
   Officer will evaluate whether information constitutes material,
   nonpublic information, and whether a duty exists that makes use of such
   information improper. If the Code of Ethics Officer determines either
   (a) that the information is not material or is public, or (b) that use
   of the information is proper, he will issue a written approval to the
   employee specifically authorizing trading while in possession of the
   information, if the employee so requests. If the Code of Ethics Officer
   determines (a) that the information may be nonpublic and material, and
   (b) that use of such information may be improper, he will place the
   security that is the subject of such information on the Red List.

2. An employee who reports potential inside information to the Code of
   Ethics Officer should expect that the Code of Ethics Officer will need
   significant information to make the evaluation described in the foregoing
   paragraph, including information about (a) the manner in which the employee
   acquired the information, and (b) the identity of individuals to whom the
   employee has revealed the information, or who have otherwise learned the
   information. The Code of Ethics Officer may place the affected security or
   securities on the Red List pending the completion of his evaluation.

3. If an employee possesses documents, disks, or other materials containing
   the potential inside information, an employee must take precautions to
   ensure the confidentiality of the information in question. Those
   precautions include (a) putting documents containing such information out
   of the view of a casual observer, and (b) securing files containing such
   documents or ensuring that computer files reflecting such information are
   secure from viewing by others.


* Section 2.   Overview of Insider Trading

A. Introduction

   This section of the Policy Statement provides guidelines for employees as
   to what may constitute inside information. It is possible that in the
   course of her employment, an employee may receive inside information. No
   employee should misuse that information, either by trading for her own
   account or by communicating the information to others.

B. What constitutes unlawful insider trading?

   The basic definition of unlawful insider trading is trading on material,
   nonpublic information (also called "inside information") by an individual
   who has a duty not to "take advantage" of the information. What does this
   definition mean? The following sections help explain the definition.

1. What is material information?

   Trading on inside information is not a basis for liability unless the
   information is material. Information is "material" if a reasonable person
   would attach importance to the information in determining his course of
   action with respect to a security. Information which is reasonably likely
   to affect the price of a company's securities is "material," but effect on
   price is not the sole criterion for determining materiality. Information
   that employees should consider material includes but is not limited to:
   dividend changes, earnings estimates, changes in previously released
   earnings estimates, reorganization, recapitalization, asset sales, plans
   to commence a tender offer, merger or acquisition proposals or agreements,
   major litigation, liquidity problems, significant contracts, and
   extraordinary management developments.

   Material information does not have to relate to a company's business. For
   example, a court considered as material certain information about the
   contents of a forthcoming newspaper column that was expected to affect the
   market price of a security. In that case, a reporter for The Wall Street
   Journal was found criminally liable for disclosing to others the dates
   that reports on various companies would appear in the Journal's "Heard on
   the Street" column and whether those reports would be favorable or not.


2. What is nonpublic information?

   Information is nonpublic until it has been effectively communicated to,
   and sufficient opportunity has existed for it to be absorbed by, the
   marketplace. One must be able to point to some fact to show that the
   information is generally public. For example, information found in a
   report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or appearing
   in Dow Jones, Reuters Economic Services, The Wall Street Journal, or
   other publications of general circulation would be considered public.

3. Who has a duty not to "take advantage" of inside information?

   Unlawful insider trading occurs only if there is a duty not to "take
   advantage" of material nonpublic information. When there is no such duty,
   it is permissible to trade while in possession of such information.
   Questions as to whether a duty exists are complex, fact-specific, and
   must be answered by a lawyer.

a. Insiders and Temporary Insiders. Corporate "insiders" have a duty not to
   take advantage of inside information. The concept of "insider" is broad.
   It includes officers, directors, and employees of a corporation. In
   addition, a person can be a "temporary insider" if she enters into a
   special confidential relationship with a corporation and as a result is
   given access to information concerning the corporation's affairs. A
   temporary insider can include, among others, accounting firms, consulting
   firms, law firms, banks and the employees of such organizations. Putnam
   would generally be a temporary insider of a corporation it advises or for
   which it performs other services, because typically Putnam clients expect
   Putnam to keep any information disclosed to it confidential.

EXAMPLE

An investment adviser to the pension fund of a large publicly-traded
corporation, Acme, Inc., learns from an Acme employee that Acme will not
be making the minimum required annual contribution to the pension fund
because of a serious downturn in Acme's financial situation. The
information conveyed is material and nonpublic.

COMMENT

Neither the investment adviser, its employees, nor clients can trade on
the basis of that information, because the investment adviser and its
employees could be considered "temporary insiders" of Acme.

b. Misappropriators. Certain people who are not insiders (or temporary
   insiders) also have a duty not to deceptively take advantage of inside
   information. Included in this category is an individual who
   "misappropriates" (or takes for his own use) material, nonpublic
   information in violation of a duty owed either to the corporation
   that is the subject of inside information or some other entity. Such
   a misappropriator can be held liable if he trades while in possession
   of that material, nonpublic information.

EXAMPLE

The chief financial officer of Acme, Inc., is aware of Acme's plans to
engage in a hostile takeover of Profit, Inc. The proposed hostile
takeover is material and nonpublic.

COMMENT

The chief financial officer of Acme cannot trade in Profit, Inc.'s stock
for his own account. Even though he owes no duty to Profit, Inc., or its
shareholders, he owes a duty to Acme not to "take advantage" of the
information about the proposed hostile takeover by using it for his
personal benefit.

c. Tippers and Tippees. A person (the "tippee") who receives material,
   nonpublic information from an insider or misappropriator (the "tipper")
   has a duty not to trade while in possession of that information if he
   knew or should have known that the information was provided by the tipper
   for an improper purpose and in breach of a duty owed by the tipper. In
   this context, it is an improper purpose for a person to provide such
   information for personal benefit, such as money, affection, or friendship.

EXAMPLE

The chief executive officer of Acme, Inc., tells his daughter that
negotiations concerning a previously-announced acquisition of Acme have
been terminated. This news is material and, at the time the father tells
his daughter, nonpublic. The daughter sells her shares of Acme.

COMMENT

The father is a tipper because he has a duty to Acme and its
shareholders not to "take advantage" of the information concerning the
breakdown of negotiations, and he has conveyed the information for an
"improper" purpose (here, out of love and affection for his daughter).
The daughter is a "tippee" and is liable for trading on inside
information because she knew or should have known that her father was
conveying the information to her for his personal benefit, and that her
father had a duty not to "take advantage" of Acme information.

A person can be a tippee even if he did not learn the information
directly from the tipper, but learned it from a previous tippee.

EXAMPLE

An employee of a law firm which works on mergers and acquisitions learns
at work about impending acquisitions. She tells her friend and her
friend's stockbroker about the upcoming acquisitions on a regular basis.
The stockbroker tells the brother of a client on a regular basis, who in
turn tells two friends, A and B. A and B buy shares of the companies
being acquired before public announcement of the acquisition, and
regularly profit from such purchases. A and B do not know the employee
of the law firm. They do not, however, ask about the source of the
information.

COMMENT

A and B, although they have never heard of the tipper, are tippees
because they did not ask about the source of the information, even
though they were experienced investors, and were aware that the "tips"
they received from this particular source were always right.

C. Who can be liable for insider trading?

   The categories of individuals discussed above (insiders, temporary
   insiders, misappropriators or tippees) can be liable if they trade while
   in possession of material nonpublic information.

   In addition, individuals other than those who actually trade on inside
   information can be liable for trades of others. A tipper can be liable
   if (a) he provided the information in exchange for a personal benefit in
   breach of a duty and (b) the recipient of the information (the "tippee")
   traded while in possession of the information.

   Most importantly, a controlling person can be liable if the controlling
   person "knew or recklessly disregarded" the fact that the controlled
   person was likely to engage in misuse of inside information and failed to
   take appropriate steps to prevent it. Putnam is a "controlling person" of
   its employees. In addition, certain supervisors may be "controlling
   persons" of those employees they supervise.

EXAMPLE

A supervisor of an analyst learns that the analyst has, over a long
period of time, secretly received material inside information from Acme,
Inc.'s chief financial officer. The supervisor learns that the analyst
has engaged in a number of trades for his personal account on the basis
of the inside information. The supervisor takes no action.

COMMENT

Even if he is not liable to a private plaintiff, the supervisor can be
liable to the Securities and Exchange Commission for a civil penalty of
up to three times the amount of the analyst's profit. (Penalties are
discussed in the following section.)

D. Penalties for Insider Trading

   Penalties for misuse of inside information are severe, both for individuals
   involved in such unlawful conduct and their employers. A person who
   violates the insider trading laws can be subject to some or all of the
   penalties below, even if he does not personally benefit from the violation.
   Penalties include:

- -- jail sentences (of which at least one to three years must be served)

- -- criminal penalties for individuals of up to $1,000,000, and for corporations
   of up to $2,500,000

- -- injunctions permanently preventing an individual from working in the
   securities industry

- -- injunctions ordering an individual to pay over profits obtained from
   unlawful insider trading

- -- civil penalties of up to three times the profit gained or loss avoided
   by the trader, even if the individual paying the penalty did not trade
   or did not benefit personally

- -- civil penalties for the employer or other controlling person of up to the
   greater of $1,000,000 or three times the amount of profit gained or loss
   avoided

- -- damages in the amount of actual losses suffered by other participants in
   the market for the security at issue.

Regardless of whether penalties or money damages are sought by others,
Putnam will take whatever action it deems appropriate (including
dismissal) if Putnam determines, in its sole discretion, that an
employee appears to have committed any violation of this Policy
Statement, or to have engaged in any conduct which raises significant
questions about whether an insider trading violation has occurred.


* Appendix B.   Policy Statement Regarding Employee Trades in Shares of
                Putnam Closed-End Funds

1. Pre-clearance for all employees

Any purchase or sale of Putnam closed-end fund shares by a Putnam
employee must be pre-cleared by the Code of Ethics Officer or, in his
absence, the Deputy Code of Ethics Officer. A list of the closed-end
funds can be obtained from the Code of Ethics Administrator. Trading in
shares of closed-end funds is subject to all the rules of the Code of
Ethics.

2. Special Rules Applicable to Managing Directors of Putnam Investment
   Management, LLC and officers of the Putnam Funds

Please be aware that any employee who is a Managing Director of Putnam
Investment Management, Inc. (the investment manager of the Putnam mutual
funds) and officers of the Putnam Funds will not receive clearance to
engage in any combination of purchase and sale or sale and purchase of
the shares of a given closed-end fund within six months of each other.
Therefore, purchases should be made only if you intend to hold the
shares more than six months; no sales of fund shares should be made if
you intend to purchase additional shares of that same fund within six
months.

You are also required to file certain forms with the Securities and
Exchange Commission in connection with purchases and sales of Putnam
closed-end funds. Please contact the Code of Ethics Officer or Deputy
Code of Ethics Officer for further information.

3. Reporting by all employees

As with any purchase or sale of a security, duplicate confirmations of
all such purchases and sales must be forwarded to the Code of Ethics
Officer by the broker-dealer utilized by an employee. If you are
required to file a quarterly report of all personal securities
transactions, this report should include all purchases and sales of
closed-end fund shares.

Please contact the Code of Ethics Officer or Deputy Code of Ethics
Officer if there are any questions regarding these matters.

* Appendix D.   Procedures for Approval of New Financial Instruments

1. Summary

a. Putnam has adopted procedures for the introduction of new instruments and
   securities, focusing on, but not limited to, derivatives.

b. No new types of securities or instruments may be purchased for any
   Putnam fund or other client account without the approval of Putnam's New
   Securities Review Committee ("NSRC").

c. Putnam publishes from time to time a list of approved derivatives. The
   purchase of any derivative not listed is prohibited without specific
   authorization from the NSRC.

2. Procedures

a. Introduction. The purchase and sale of financial instruments that have not
   been used previously at Putnam raise significant investment, business,
   operational, and compliance issues. In order to address these issues in a
   comprehensive manner, Putnam has adopted the following procedures for
   obtaining approval of the use of new instruments or investments. In
   addition, to provide guidance regarding the purchase of derivatives,
   Putnam publishes from time to time a list of approved derivatives. Only
   derivatives listed may be used for Putnam funds or accounts unless
   specifically authorized by the NSRC.

b. Process of approval. An investment professional wishing to purchase a new
   type of investment should discuss it with the Investment Division's
   Administrative office (the current contact is Julie Malloy). Investment
   Division Administration will coordinate a review of a new instrument by
   appropriate NSRC members from an investment, operational and compliance
   perspective, including the review of instruments by the Administrative
   Services Division of PFTC. Based on this review, the NSRC will then
   approve or disapprove the proposed new investment. Investment
   professionals must build in adequate time for this review before planned
   use of a new instrument. Further, the approval of the NSRC is only a
   general one. Individual fund and account guidelines must be reviewed in
   accordance with standard compliance procedures to determine whether
   purchase is permitted. In addition, if the instrument involves legal
   documentation, that documentation must be reviewed and be completed before
   trading. The NSRC may prepare a compliance and operational manual for the
   new derivative.

3. Violations

a. Putnam's Operating Committee has determined that adherence to rigorous
   internal controls and procedures for novel securities and instruments is
   necessary to protect Putnam's business standing and reputation. Violation
   of these procedures will be treated as violation of both compliance
   guidelines and Putnam's Code of Ethics.  Putnam encourages questions and
   expects that these guidelines will be interpreted conservatively.

independent practice.

and prevent such violations.

Prospects

judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity in making

particular care in determining applicable fiduciary duty and shall
comply with such duty as to those persons and interests to whom the duty
is owed. Members must act for the benefit of their clients and place
their clients' interests before their own.

B.2  Portfolio Investment Recommendations and Actions. Members shall:

a. Make a reasonable inquiry into a client's financial situation,
investment experience, and investment objectives prior to making any
investment recommendations and shall update this information as
necessary, but no less frequently than annually, to allow the members to
adjust their investment recommendations to reflect changed
circumstances.

b. Consider the appropriateness and suitability of investment
recommendations or actions for each portfolio or client. In determining
appropriateness and suitability, members shall consider applicable
relevant factors, including the needs and circumstances of the portfolio

basic characteristics of the total portfolio. Members shall not make a

is suitable to the client's financial situation, investment experience,
and investment objectives.

recommendations.

B.3  Fair Dealing. Members shall deal fairly and objectively with all
clients and prospects when disseminating investment recommendations,
disseminating material changes in prior investment recommendations, and
taking investment action.

B.4  Priority of Transactions. Transactions for clients and employers
shall have priority over transactions in securities or other investments
of which a member is the beneficial owner so that such personal
transactions do not operate adversely to their clients' or employer's
interests. If members make a recommendation regarding the purchase or
sale of a security or other investment, they shall give their clients
and employer adequate opportunity to act on their recommendations before
acting on their own behalf. For purposes of the Code and Standards, a
member is a "beneficial owner" if the member has

investments;

c. the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security or
investment.

B.5  Preservation of Confidentiality. Members shall preserve the
confidentiality of information communicated by clients, prospects, or
employers concerning matters within the scope of the client-member,
prospect-member, or employer-member relationship unless a member
receives information concerning illegal activities on the part of the
client, prospect, or employer.

B.6  Prohibition against Misrepresentation. Members shall not make any
statements, orally or in writing, that misrepresent

a. the services that they or their firms are capable of performing;

b. their qualifications or the qualifications of their firm;

c. the member's academic or professional credentials.

Members shall not make or imply, orally or in writing, any assurances or
guarantees regarding any investment except to communicate accurate
information regarding the terms of the investment instrument and the
issuer's obligations under the instrument.

B.7  Disclosure of Conflicts to Clients and Prospects. Members shall
disclose to their clients and prospects all matters, including
beneficial ownership of securities or other investments, that reasonably
could be expected to impair the members' ability to make unbiased and
objective recommendations.

B.8  Disclosure of Referral Fees. Members shall disclose to clients and
prospects any consideration or benefit received by the member or
delivered to others for the recommendation of any services to the client
or prospect.

Standard V: Relationships with and Responsibilities to the Public

A. Prohibition against Use of Material Nonpublic Information. Members
who possess material nonpublic information related to the value of a
security shall not trade or cause others to trade in that security if
such trading would breach a duty or if the information was
misappropriated or relates to a tender offer. If members receive
material nonpublic information in confidence, they shall not breach that
confidence by trading or causing others to trade in securities to which
such information relates. Members shall make reasonable efforts to
achieve public dissemination of material nonpublic information disclosed
in breach of a duty.

B. Performance Presentation.

1. Members shall not make any statements, orally or in writing, that
misrepresent the investment performance that they or their firms have
accomplished or can reasonably be expected to achieve.

2. If members communicate individual or firm performance information
directly or indirectly to clients or prospective clients, or in a manner
intended to be received by clients or prospective clients, members shall
make every reasonable effort to assure that such performance information
is a fair, accurate, and complete presentation of such performance.
