             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
SkyBridge Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of
SkyBridge Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC
(formerly Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios
LLC) (the Company), including the schedule of investments, as of March 31, 2011
and the related statements of operations and cash flows for the year then ended,
the statements of changes in shareholders' capital for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years
in the five-year period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of March 31, 2011, by correspondence with underlying fund
operators, the custodian and other appropriate auditing procedures. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
SkyBridge Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC as of
March 31, 2011, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended, the changes in its shareholders' capital for each of the years
in the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
years in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

     The above ratios may vary for individual investors based on the timing of

     using the total of monthly income and expense divided by beginning of month
     shares.

**   The ratios of expenses and net investment loss to average Shareholders'
     capital do not include the impact of expenses and incentive allocations or
     incentive fees related to the underlying Investment Funds or the impact of
     any placement fees paid by the Shareholder.

***  The subscription and redemption fees were immaterial and therefore had no
     impact on the ratio of expenses to average Shareholders capital and the
     ratio of net investment loss to average Shareholders capital for the year
     ended March 31, 2011. Furthermore, for the prior years ended 2010, 2009 and
     2008, the Company incurred redemption fees of $328,671, $2,199,068 and
     $2,151,669, respectively. Had the Company not incurred these fees, the
     ratio of expenses to average Shareholders capital and the ratio of net
     investment loss to average Shareholders capital would have been 1.99% and
     (1.98)% for the year end 2010, 2.30% and (2.29)% for the year end 2009 and
     2.40% and (2.37)% for the year ended 2008, respectively. There were no
     subscription or redemption fees for the year ended 2007.

SKYBRIDGE MULTI-ADVISER HEDGE FUND PORTFOLIOS LLC

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2011

1.   ORGANIZATION

     SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC (formerly known as
     Citigroup Alternative Investments Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC)
     (the "Company") was organized as a Delaware Limited Liability Company on
     August 16, 2002. The Company is registered under the Investment Company Act
     of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as amended, as a closed-end, non-diversified
     management investment company. The Company is also registered under the
     Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act").

     The investment objective of the Company is to achieve capital appreciation
     principally through investing in investment funds ("Investment Funds")
     managed by third-party investment managers ("Investment Managers") that
     employ a variety of alternative investment strategies. These investment
     strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or
     short-side positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across
     the global markets, often referred to as "alternative" strategies. Because
     Investment Funds following alternative investment strategies are often
     described as hedge funds, the investment program of the Company can be
     described as a fund of hedge funds.

     Shares of the Company ("Shares") are sold to eligible investors (referred
     to as "Shareholders"). The minimum initial investment in the Company from
     each Shareholder is $25,000; the minimum additional investment is $10,000.

     SkyBridge Capital II, LLC (the "Adviser"), a Delaware limited liability
     company, serves as the Company's investment adviser. The Adviser is
     registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of
     1940, as amended, and, among other things, is responsible for the
     allocation of the Company's assets to various Investment Funds. Under the
     Company's governing documents, the Company has delegated substantially all
     authority to oversee the management of the operations and assets of the
     Company to the Board of Directors.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and
     are expressed in United States dollars. The following is a summary of
     significant accounting and reporting policies used in preparing the
     financial statements.

     A.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     Investments in Investment Funds are subject to the terms of the respective
     limited partnership agreements, limited liability company agreements,
     offering memoranda and such negotiated "side letter" or similar
     arrangements as the Adviser may have entered into with the Investment Fund
     on behalf of the Company. The Company's investments in the Investment Funds
     are carried at fair value as determined by the Company's pro-rata interest
     in the net assets of each Investment Fund.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2011 (CONTINUED)

     All valuations utilize financial information supplied by each Investment
     Fund and are net of management and performance incentive fees or other
     allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers as required by the
     Investment Funds' agreements. Each Investment Manager to which the Adviser
     allocates assets will charge the Company, as an investor in an underlying
     Investment Fund, an asset-based fee, and some or all of the Investment
     Managers will receive performance-based compensation in the form of an
     incentive fee. The asset-based fees of the Investment Managers are
     generally expected to range from 1% to 4% annually of the net assets under
     their management and the incentive fee is generally expected to range from
     15% to 25% of net profits annually. These management and incentive fees are
     accounted for in the valuations of the Investment Funds and are not
     included in the management fees reflected in the Statement of Operations.

     The Company may invest in Investment Funds that may designate certain
     investments within those Investment Funds, typically those that are
     especially illiquid and/or hard to value, as "special situation" (often
     called "Side-Pocket") investments with additional redemption limitations.
     Such a Side-Pocket is, in effect, similar to a private equity fund that
     requires its investors to remain invested for the duration of the fund and
     distributes returns on the investment only when liquid assets are generated
     within the fund, typically through the sale of the fund's illiquid assets
     in exchange for cash.

     As a general matter, the fair value of the Company's investment in an
     Investment Fund represents the amount that the Company can reasonably
     expect to receive if the Company's investment was sold in an orderly
     transaction at the time of valuation. The Investment Funds provide for
     periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually. Investment Funds
     generally require advance notice of a Shareholder's intent to redeem its
     interest, and may, depending on the Investment Funds' governing agreements,
     deny or delay a redemption request. The Company considers whether a
     liquidity discount on any Investment Fund should be taken due to redemption
     restrictions or suspensions by the Investment Fund. However, the effects of
     any discounts related to redemption restrictions or lock-up periods were
     determined by the Adviser to be insignificant at March 31, 2011, and
     therefore, no discounts were applied to the fair value of the Investment
     Funds. The underlying investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for
     at fair value as described in each Investment Fund's financial statements.
     The Investment Funds may invest a portion of their assets in restricted
     securities and other investments that are illiquid.

     B.   NET ASSET VALUE DETERMINATION

     The net asset value of the Company is determined as of the close of
     business at the end of each month in accordance with the valuation
     principles set forth below or as may be determined from time to time
     pursuant to policies established by the Board of Directors.

     Retroactive adjustments to the Company's net asset value might be made
     after the valuation date which could impact the net asset value per share
     at which Shareholders purchase or sell Company Shares. The valuations
     reported by the Investment Funds, upon which the Company calculates its
     month end net asset value, may be subject to adjustment subsequent to the
     valuation date, based on information which becomes available after that
     valuation date. For example, fiscal year-end net

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2011 (CONTINUED)

     asset values of an Investment Fund may be revised as a result of a year-end
     audit performed by the independent auditors of that Investment Fund. Other
     adjustments to the Company's net asset value may also occur from time to
     time, such as from the misapplication by the Company or its agents of the
     valuation policies described in the Company's valuation procedures.

     Retroactive adjustments to the Company's net asset value, which are caused
     by adjustments to the Investment Funds values or by a misapplication of the
     Company's valuation policies, that are able to be made within 90 days of
     the valuation date(s) to which the adjustment would apply will be made
     automatically unless determined to be de minimis. Other potential
     retroactive adjustments, regardless of whether their impact increases or
     decreases the Company's net asset value, will be made only if they both (i)
     are caused by a misapplication of the Company's valuation policies and (ii)
     deemed to be material. All retroactive adjustments are reported to the
     Company's Valuation Committee and to affected Shareholders.

     The Company follows a policy which permits revisions to the number of
     Shares purchased or sold by Shareholders due to retroactive adjustments
     made under the circumstances described above which occur within 90 days of
     the valuation date. In circumstances where a retroactive adjustment is not
     made under the circumstances described above, Shares purchased or sold by
     Shareholders will not be adjusted. As a result, to the extent that the
     subsequent impact of the event which was not adjusted adversely affects the
     Company's net asset value, the outstanding Shares of the Company will be
     adversely affected by prior repurchases made at a net asset value per Share
     higher than the adjusted value. Conversely, any increases in net asset
     value per Share resulting from such subsequent impact will be to the
     benefit of the holders of the outstanding Shares of the Company and to the
     detriment of Shareholders who previously had their Shares repurchased at a
     net asset value per Share lower than the post-impact value. New
     Shareholders may be affected in a similar way, because the same principles
     apply to the purchase of Shares.

     C.   INCOME RECOGNITION AND EXPENSES

     Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis as earned. Expenses are
     recognized as incurred. Income, expenses and realized and unrealized gains
     and losses are recorded monthly.

     The change in an Investment Fund's net asset value is included in net
     change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments in Investment
     Funds on the Statement of Operations. During the year ended March 31, 2011,
     the Company accounted for realized gains and losses from Investment Fund
     transactions based on the pro-rata ratio of the fair value and cost of the
     underlying investment at the date of redemption. Previously, the Company
     utilized the cost recovery method. This retroactive change in presentation
     resulted in an increase in cost in the amount of $5,624,268 through a
     decrease in unrealized appreciation and a corresponding increase in
     realized gain at March 31, 2010. The change did not affect the Company's
     financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For tax purposes,
     the Company continues to use the cost recovery method with respect to sales
     of Investment Funds that are classified as partnerships for U.S. federal
     tax purposes, and the first-in-first-out method with respect to sales of
     Investment Funds that are classified as corporations for U.S. federal tax
     purposes.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2011 (CONTINUED)

     The Company bears all expenses incurred in the course of its operations,
     including, but not limited to, the following: all costs and expenses
     related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Company's account;
     professional fees; costs of insurance; registration expenses; and expenses
     of meetings of the Board of Directors.

     D.   INCOME TAXES

     The Company became a corporation that is taxed as a regulated investment
     company ("RIC') as of October 1, 2005. The Company operated as a
     partnership from inception through September 30, 2005.

     It is the Company's intention to meet the requirements of the Internal
     Revenue Code applicable to RICs and distribute substantially all of its
     taxable net investment income and capital gains, if any, to Shareholders
     each year. Therefore, no federal income or excise tax provision is required
     for the Company's financial statements. While the Company intends to
     distribute substantially all of its taxable net investment income and
     capital gains, in the manner necessary to avoid imposition of the 4% excise
     tax as described above, it is possible that some excise tax will be
     incurred. In such event, the Company will be liable for the tax only on the
     amount by which it does not meet the foregoing distribution requirements.
     During the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company incurred $189,591 of
     excise tax which is recognized as a component of miscellaneous expenses on
     the Statement of Operations. This expense was attributable to the Company
     for not distributing at least 98% of its income during the calendar year
     ended December 31, 2009.

     The Company has analyzed tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the
     course of preparing the Company's tax return for all open tax years and has
     concluded, as of March 31, 2011, no provision for income tax would be
     required in the Company's financial statements. The Company's federal and
     state income and federal excise tax returns for tax years for which the
     applicable statutes of limitations have not expired are subject to
     examination by the Internal Revenue Service and state departments of
     revenue. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to
     unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in the Statement of
     Operations. During the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company did not incur
     any interest or penalties.

     E.   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and monies invested in
     money market deposit accounts that are accounted for at amortized cost,
     which approximates fair value. Such cash, at times, may exceed federally
     insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts
     and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk on such
     bank deposits.

     F.   USE OF ESTIMATES AND RECLASSIFICATIONS

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
     management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
     amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
     Changes in the economic environment, financial markets, and

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2011 (CONTINUED)

     any other parameters used in determining these estimates could cause actual
     results to differ materially.

     Certain amounts have been reclassified from the prior year's information to
     conform to the current year's presentation.

     G.   NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
     Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2010-06 which requires new disclosures
     and provides amendments to Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC")
     Subtopic 820-10 clarifying existing disclosures. The disclosure regarding
     the Level 3 investment rollforward of purchases and sales activity on a
     gross basis is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
     2010. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this disclosure on
     its financial statements.

3.   FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES

     In accordance with the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements
     and disclosures under GAAP, the Company discloses the fair value of its
     investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
     techniques used to measure the fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest
     priority to valuations based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active
     markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the
     lowest priority to valuations based upon unobservable inputs that are
     significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurement). The guidance
     establishes three levels of fair value as listed below.

     Level 1- Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for
     identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access
     at the measurement date;

     Level 2- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset
     or liability either directly or indirectly, including inputs in markets
     that are not considered to be active;

     Level 3- Inputs that are unobservable.

     The notion of unobservable inputs is intended to allow for situations in
     which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability
     at the measurement date. Under Level 3, the owner of an asset must
     determine valuation based on their own assumptions about what market
     participants would take into account in determining the fair value of the
     asset, using the best information available.

     The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not necessarily
     an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities.

     The following is a summary of the investment strategies, their liquidity
     and redemption notice periods and any restrictions on the liquidity
     provisions of the investments in Investment Funds held by the Company as of
     March 31, 2011. Investment Funds with no current redemption restrictions
     may be subject to future gates, lock-up provisions or other restrictions,
     in accordance with their

     offering documents which would affect its disclosure. The Company had no
     unfunded capital commitments as of March 31, 2011.

     Directional equity funds take long and short stock positions. The manager
     may attempt to profit from both long and short stock positions
     independently, or profit from the relative outperformance of long positions
     against short positions. The stock picking and portfolio construction
     process is usually based on bottom-up fundamental stock analysis, but may
     also include top-down macro-based views, market trends and sentiment
     factors. Directional equity managers may specialize by region (e.g.,
     global, U.S., Europe or Japan) or by sector. No assurance can be given that
     the managers will be able to correctly locate profitable trading
     opportunities, and such opportunities may be adversely affected by
     unforeseen events. In addition, short selling creates the risk of loss if
     the security that has been sold short appreciates in value. The Investment
     Funds within this strategy have monthly to annual liquidity, and are
     generally subject to a 30 to 90 day notice period. Three Investment Funds
     in this strategy, representing approximately 1 percent in this strategy,
     are illiquid side pocket investments, and have suspended redemptions. In
     addition, another approximately 20 percent of the Investment Funds in this
     strategy are classified as Level 3 investments due to liquidity provisions
     on a greater than quarterly basis. The remaining approximately 79 percent
     of the Investment Funds in this strategy can be redeemed with no
     restrictions as of the measurement date, and so, are classified as Level 2
     investments in Investment Funds.

     Directional macro strategies require well developed risk management
     procedures due to the frequent employment of leverage. Investment managers
     may trade futures, options on future contracts and foreign exchange
     contracts and may trade in diversified markets or focus on one market
     sector. Two types of strategies employed by directional macro managers are
     discretionary and systematic trading. Discretionary trading strategies seek
     to dynamically allocate capital to relatively short-term trading
     opportunities around the world. Directional strategies (seeking to
     participate in rising and declining markets when the trend appears strong
     and justified by fundamentals) and relative value approaches (establishing
     long positions in undervalued instruments and short positions in related
     instruments believed to be over valued) or in "spread" positions in an
     attempt to capture changes in the relationships between instruments.
     Systematic trading strategies generally rely on computerized trading
     systems or models to identify and capitalize on trends in financial and
     commodity markets. This systematic approach allows investment managers to
     seek to take advantage of price patterns in very large number of markets.
     The trading models may be focused on technical or fundamental factors or
     combination of factors. Generally, the Investment Funds within this
     strategy have monthly liquidity, subject to a 5 to 90 day notice period.
     Investment Funds in this strategy, representing approximately 3 percent in
     this strategy, are illiquid side pocket investments with suspended
     redemptions and are classified as Level 3 investments. The remaining
     approximately 97 percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy can be
     redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date, and so, are
     classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     Event driven strategies involve investing in opportunities created by
     significant transactional events such as spin-offs, mergers and
     acquisitions, bankruptcies, recapitalizations and share buybacks. Event
     driven strategies include "merger arbitrage" and "distressed securities".
     Generally, the Investment Funds within this strategy have monthly to annual
     liquidity, subject to a 30 to 180 day


                                      -14-

     notice period. Investment Funds in this strategy, representing
     approximately 2 percent in this strategy, are illiquid side pocket
     investments with suspended redemptions. Approximately 2 percent of the
     Investment Funds in this strategy have gated redemptions, which are
     expected to be lifted within 12 to 36 months. In addition, approximately 15
     percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy are classified as Level 3
     investments due to liquidity provisions on a greater than quarterly basis.
     The remaining approximately 81 percent of the Investment Funds in this
     strategy can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date,
     and so, are classified as Level 2 investments in Investment Funds.

     Relative value strategies seek to take advantage of specific pricing
     anomalies, while also seeking to maintain minimal exposure to systematic
     market risk. This may be achieved by purchasing one security previously
     believed to be undervalued, while selling short another security perceived
     to be overvalued. Relative value arbitrage strategies include equity market
     neutral, statistical arbitrage, convertible arbitrage, and fixed income
     arbitrage. Some investment managers classified as multi-strategy relative
     value arbitrage use a combination of these substrategies. Generally, the
     Investment Funds within this strategy have monthly to quarterly liquidity,
     subject to a 30 to 90 day notice period. Investment Funds in this strategy,
     representing approximately 2 percent in this strategy, are illiquid side
     pocket investments with suspended redemptions. The remaining approximately
     98 percent of the Investment Funds in this strategy can be redeemed with no
     restrictions as of the measurement date, and so, are classified as Level 2
     investments in Investment Funds.

     The Company follows the authoritative guidance under GAAP on determining
     fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability
     have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not
     orderly. Accordingly, if the Company determines that either the volume
     and/or level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly
     decreased (from normal conditions for that asset or liability) or price
     quotations or observable inputs are not associated with orderly
     transactions, increased analysis and management judgment will be required
     to estimate fair value. Valuation techniques such as an income approach
     might be appropriate to supplement or replace a market approach in those
     circumstances.

     The guidance also provides a list of factors to determine whether there has
     been a significant decrease in relation to normal market activity.
     Regardless, however, of the valuation technique and inputs used, the
     objective for the fair value measurement in those circumstances is
     unchanged from what it would be if markets were operating at normal
     activity levels and/or transactions were orderly; that is, to determine the
     current exit price.

     A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based
     upon the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value
     measurement. However, the determination of what constitutes "observable"
     requires significant judgment by the Adviser. The Adviser considers
     observable data to be market data which is readily available, regularly
     distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and
     provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant
     market.

     Generally, initial and additional subscriptions for Shares may be accepted

     from time to time and in its complete and exclusive discretion, may
     determine to cause the Company to repurchase Shares from Shareholders
     pursuant to written tenders by Shareholders on such terms and conditions as
     it may determine. The Adviser expects that it typically will recommend to
     the Board of Directors that the Company offer to repurchase Shares from
     Shareholders quarterly, on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and
     December 31 (or, if any such date is not a business day, on the immediately

7.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Company
     invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
     investment activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
     not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts and
     entering into equity swaps. The Company's risk of loss in these Investment
     Funds is limited to the value of its investment in the respective
     Investment Funds.

8.   INCOME TAXES

     The tax basis of distributable earnings shown in the table below represent
     distribution requirements the Company must satisfy under the income tax
     regulations, losses the Company may be able to offset against income and
     gains realized in future years and unrealized appreciation or depreciation
     of Investment Funds for federal income tax purposes.

</TABLE>

     The primary difference between the book and tax appreciation or
     depreciation of Investment Funds is attributable to adjustments to the tax
     basis of Investment Funds based on allocation of income and distributions
     from Investment Funds and the tax realization of financial statement
     unrealized gain or loss. In addition, the cost of Investment Funds for
     federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items of taxable income
     allocated to the Company from the Investment Funds. The allocated taxable
     income is reported to the Company by each Investment Fund on Schedule K-1.
     The aggregate cost on Investment Funds for federal income tax purposes is
     therefore calculated and presented annually as of March 31. The aggregate
     cost on Investment Funds and the composition of unrealized appreciation and
     depreciation on Investment Funds for federal income tax purposes is noted
     below.

</TABLE>

     Net investment income (loss) and net realized gain (loss) differ for
     financial statement and tax purposes. The character of dividends and
     distributions made during the fiscal year from net investment income or net
     realized gains differ from their ultimate characterization for federal
     income tax purposes. Also, due to timing of dividends and distributions,
     the fiscal year in which amounts are distributed differ from the fiscal
     year in which the income or net realized gain was recorded by the Company.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - MARCH 31, 2011 (CONTINUED)

     Accordingly, the following amounts have been reclassified for March 31,
     2011, and are primarily due to the different book to tax treatment for the
     distributive share of partnership items, different book to tax treatment
     for gains realized on the sale of Investment Funds classified as passive
     foreign investment companies and retroactive changes in the cost recovery
     method presentation on Financial Statements.

     Net assets of the Company were unaffected by the reclassifications.

     As noted above, the differences between book and tax treatment for certain
     items impact the amount of distributable income and to conform with U.S.

     (loss). The following table reconciles the beginning and end of year
     balances of accumulated net investment income (loss).

</TABLE>

     For the year ended March 31, 2011, the tax character of distributions paid
     by the Company was $92,062,159 ordinary income. For the year ended March
     31, 2010, the tax character of distributions paid by the Company was
     $85,488,824 ordinary income. Distributions from net investment income and
     short-term capital gains are treated as ordinary income for federal income
     tax purposes.

     As of March 31, 2011, the Company has a capital loss carryforward of
     $36,398,784, which is available to offset future capital gains. If not
     utilized against capital gains, this capital loss carryforward will expire
     on March 31, 2018.

     As permitted by federal tax rules, the Company intends to treat capital
     losses of $5,864,617 incurred between November 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011
     as being incurred during the tax year ending on March 31, 2011. These
     losses are available to offset future capital gains, if any.

     Under the recently enacted Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act
     of 2010, the Company is permitted to carryforward capital losses incurred
     in taxable years beginning after

     December 22, 2010 ("post-enactment losses") for an unlimited period.
     However, any post-enactment losses are required to be utilized before the
     utilization of losses incurred prior to the effective date of the Act. As a
     result of this ordering rule, capital loss carryforwards related to taxable
     years beginning prior to the effective date of the Act may be more likely
     to expire unused. Additionally, post-enactment capital losses that are
     carried forward will retain their character as either short term or
     long-term capital losses rather than being considered all short term as
     under previous law. As the principle provisions of the Act will commence
     for fiscal periods beginning after December 22, 2010, or for the Company's
     fiscal year beginning April 1, 2011, the effect of the Act on the Company
     will not be fully known until that time.

9.   REDEMPTION PENALTY

     During the year ended March 31, 2011, the Company paid redemption penalties
     totaling $48,024. The redemption penalties were charged to the Company for
     redeeming its interests of certain Investment Funds prior to the expiration
     of applicable lock-up periods. The payment of these penalties released the
     Company from any further liability for its investments in the applicable
     Investment Funds and is recorded as an operating expense in the Statement
     of Operations.

10.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events on the Company
     through the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined
     that there were no subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure in
     the financial statements.

                                   (UNAUDITED)

     The Company's officers are appointed by the Directors and oversee the
     management of the day-to-day operations of the Company under the
     supervision of the Board of Directors. One of the Directors and all of the
     officers of the Company are directors, officers or employees of the Adviser
     or its subsidiaries. The other Directors are not affiliated with the
     Adviser or its subsidiaries and are not "interested persons" as defined
     under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act (the "Independent Directors"). The
     Directors and officers of the Company also may be directors and officers of

     subsidiaries. A list of the Directors and officers of the Company and a
     brief statement of their present positions, principal occupations and

     extent allowed by applicable law, including the 1940 Act, the LLC Agreement
     indemnifies the Directors and officers for all costs, liabilities and
     expenses that they may experience as a result of their service as such.

     Certain of the Directors and officers of the Company are also directors
     and/or officers of other investment companies that are advised by the
     Adviser. (The Company and such other investment companies, if also
     registered under the 1940 Act, are referred to collectively in the
     Prospectus as the "Fund Complex."). The address for each Director and
     officer in his or her capacity as such is 527 Madison Avenue, 16th Floor,
     New York, New York 10022.

     On July 30, 2010, a special meeting of Shareholders was held to seek

     As an Advisory Director, Mr. Weinreich participated in Board meetings in
     the same manner as a full Director, except that he was ineligible to cast a
     vote on any matter, as his appointment to the Board as an Independent
     Director had not yet been ratified by Shareholders.

     In addition to his role as Independent Director of the Company, Steven
     Krull served on a special independent committee (the "Committee")
     representing clients of Citigroup Alternative Investments, LLC, the Fund's
     predecessor investment adviser. The Committee was terminated in 2010.

                             Proxy Voting Procedures

SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC (the "Fund"), a "series"
investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as

proxies of its underlying portfolio funds (or other underlying securities) to
its investment adviser, an adviser registered with the SEC pursuant to the
Advisers Act. The investment adviser, SkyBridge Capital II, LLC (the "Adviser"),
has adopted proxy-voting procedures, including those designed to address any
material conflicts of interests between the Adviser and its clients ("Adviser
Procedures"), which have been reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors of
the Fund.

Annual Review. The Board of Directors of the Fund will review the Procedures and
the Adviser Procedures annually to ensure the procedures are reasonably designed
to ensure compliance with all relevant proxy-voting rules that are applicable to
the Funds.

Form N-PX. Commencing in 2004, the Fund will cause Form N-PX to be filed by
August 31 each year and will include proxy-voting information for the one-year
period ending that June 30. Form N-PX is an

</TABLE>

     POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

     As shown in the table above, Mr. Nolte is responsible for managing other
     accounts ("Other Accounts") in addition to the Fund. In certain instances,
     conflicts may arise in his management of the Fund and such other Accounts.

     One situation where a conflict may arise between the Fund and an Other
     Account is in the allocation of investment opportunities among the Fund and
     the Other Account. For example, the Adviser may determine that there is an
     opportunity that is suitable for the Fund as well as for Other Accounts of
     the Adviser, which have a similar investment objective. As a related
     matter, a particular Investment Fund interest or other security may be
     bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling
     that same security, which may adversely affect the Fund. The Company and
     the Adviser have adopted policies and procedures regarding the allocation
     of investment opportunities, which generally require that investment
     opportunities be allocated among the Fund and Other Accounts in a manner
     that is fair, equitable and consistent with their fiduciary obligations to
     each.

     Mr. Nolte's management of the Fund and Other Accounts may result in his
     devoting a disproportionate amount of time and attention to the management
     of a particular account as against another. This particularly may be the
     case when accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons,
     asset levels and fees.

     The management of personal accounts by Mr. Nolte may give rise to potential
     conflicts of interest. While the Adviser's code of ethics will impose
     limits on the ability of Mr. Nolte to trade for his personal account, there
     is no assurance that the Adviser's code of ethics will eliminate such
     conflicts.

     Other than the conflicts described above, the Company is not aware of any
     material conflicts that may arise in connection with the Adviser's
     management of the Fund's investments and such Other Accounts.

(a)(3) COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS
- AS OF MARCH 31, 2011

     Mr. Nolte's compensation is a combination of salary, discretionary bonus,
     deferred compensation, retirement plans and automatic participation in a
     company-funded retirement bonus. The discretionary bonus is based upon the
     financial results and profitability of SkyBridge as a whole for which Mr.
     Nolte serves as chief investment officer. The discretionary bonus is not
     linked to the performance of any specific benchmark or that of any
     SkyBridge investment fund or account; nor are specific asset size targets
     considered.

          90 days of the filing date of the report that includes the disclosure
          required by this paragraph, based on their evaluation of these

          240.15d-15(b)).

     (b)  There were no changes in the registrant's internal control over
          financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act
          (17 CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that occurred during the registrant's second
          fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has
          materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
          registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

                CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND SENIOR
                               FINANCIAL OFFICERS

A.   COVERED OFFICERS, PURPOSE OF THE CODE

     This Code of Ethics (the "Code") for the Fund applies to its Chief
Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (or persons
performing similar functions) (as of August 2005, Ray Nolte as President and as
of July 2010 Robert Phillips as Treasurer; each, a "Covered Officer") for the
purpose of promoting:

     1.   honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
          or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
          relationships;

     2.   full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports
          and documents that a company files with, or submits to, the Securities
          and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications
          made by the Fund;

     3.   compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

     4.   prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
          person or persons identified in the Code; and

     5.   accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest. Any question about the application of the Code
should be referred to the Fund's Chief Legal Officer (Marie Noble).

B.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
     INTEREST

     OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of, or his or
her service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his or her family, were to receive improper
personal benefits as a result of his or her position with the Fund.(1)

----------
(1)  Because conflicts of interest may arise as a result of family
     relationships, each Covered Officer should consider such potential
     conflicts and, if appropriate, familiarize his or her family members with
     the Covered Officer's relevant obligations under this Code.

<PAGE>

     Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act") and
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For example,
Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions (such as
the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the Fund because of
their status as "affiliated persons" (as defined in the Investment Company Act)
of the Fund. The Fund's and its investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside the parameters of this
Code, unless or until the Chief Legal Officer determines any violation of such
programs and procedures is also a violation of this Code.

     Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts may arise from, or as a result of, the contractual
relationship between the Fund and its investment adviser of which the Covered
Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that
the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether
formally for the Fund or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in
establishing policies and implementing decisions that will have different
effects on the Fund and its investment adviser. The participation of the Covered
Officers in such activities is inherent in the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the adviser and is consistent with the performance by the Covered
Officers of their duties as officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in
conformity with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment
Advisers Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In
addition, it is recognized by the Fund's Board of Directors ("Board") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Fund.

     Each Covered Officer must not:

     1.   use his or her personal influence or personal relationships improperly
          to influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund
          whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally (directly or
          indirectly) to the detriment of the Fund;

     2.   cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the (direct
          or indirect) individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather
          than the benefit of the Fund; or

     3.   use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
          contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
          personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

<PAGE>

     Each Covered Officer must, at the time of signing this Code, report all
affiliations and significant business interests outside of SkyBridge Capital II,
LLC or its affiliated businesses and must update the report annually.

     Conflict of interest situations should always be approved by the Chief
Legal Officer and, if material, be communicated to the relevant Fund's Board of
Directors. Examples of these include:

     1.   service as a director on the board of any company;

     2.   accepting directly or indirectly anything of value, including gifts
          and gratuities in excess of $100 per year from any person or entity
          with which the Fund has current or prospective business dealings, not
          including occasional meals or tickets to theatre or sporting events or
          other similar entertainment, provided it is business-related,
          reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not so
          frequent as to raise any question of impropriety.

     3.   any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of the Fund's service providers, other than its
          investment adviser, principal placement agent/underwriter, or any
          affiliated person thereof;

     4.   a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
          arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
          equity ownership.

C.   DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     Each Covered Officer should:

     1.   familiarize himself or herself with the disclosure requirements
          generally applicable to the Fund;

     2.   not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to misrepresent, facts
          about the Fund to others, whether within or outside the Fund,
          including to the Fund's Directors and auditors, and to governmental
          regulators and self-regulatory organizations; and

     3.   to the extent appropriate within his or her area of responsibility,
          consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and its adviser
          with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
          understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files
          with, or submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made
          by the Fund.

     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to use reasonable efforts
to promote compliance with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable
laws, rules and regulations.

<PAGE>

D.   REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

     Each Covered Officer must:

     1.   upon adoption of the Code (thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
          Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he or she has
          received, read and understands the Code;

     2.   annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he or she has complied
          with the requirements of the Code;

     3.   not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
          Fund or its affiliated persons for reports of potential violations
          that are made in good faith; and

     4.   notify the Chief Legal Officer promptly if he or she knows of any
          violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this
          Code.

     The Chief Legal Officer is responsible for applying this Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret this Code in any particular situation. However, any explicit or
implicit waivers(2) sought by a Covered Officer must be considered by the Audit
Committee of the relevant Fund as described below.

     The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing this
Code:

     1.   the Chief Legal Officer will take appropriate action to investigate
          any potential violations reported to him or her;

     2.   if, after such investigation, the Chief Legal Officer believes that no
          violation has occurred, the Chief Legal Officer is not required to
          take any further action, but will meet with the person reporting the
          violation for the purpose of informing such person of the reason for
          not taking action;

     3.   any matter that the Chief Legal Officer believes is a violation will
          be reported to the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board;

     4.   if the Audit Committee concurs that a violation has occurred, it will
          consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
          appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
          notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
          board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer as an
          officer of the Fund;

----------
(2)  Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
     a material departure form a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
     waiver" as "the registrant's failure to take action within a reasonable
     period of time regarding a material departure from a provision of the code
     of ethics that has been made known to an executive officer" of the
     registrant.

<PAGE>

     5.   the Audit Committee will be responsible for granting waivers, as
          appropriate, provided that waivers will be considered only if
          supported by a written request on behalf of the relevant Covered
          Officer explaining the basis for such request and how the waiver may
          be implemented consistent with the principles underlying this Code;
          and

     6.   any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
          be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

     The Audit Committee, in determining whether waivers should be granted or
whether violations have occurred, and the Chief Legal Officer, in rendering
decisions and interpretations and in conducting investigations of potential
violations under the Code, may, at their discretion, consult with such other
persons as they determine to be appropriate, including, but not limited to,
another senior legal officer of the Fund or its investment adviser or its
affiliates, counsel to the Fund or its investment adviser or such affiliate,
counsel to the Independent Directors, or (subject to applicable pre-approval
requirements) independent auditors or other consultants

E.   OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes
of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Fund, the Fund's investment adviser, principal
placement agent/underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to
govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to
this Code, they are superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or
conflict with the provisions of this Code, unless any provision of this Code
conflicts with any applicable federal or state law, in which case the
requirements of such law will govern. The Fund's and its investment adviser's
and principal placement agent/underwriter's codes of ethics under 17j-1 under
the Investment Company Act are separate requirements that may apply to the
