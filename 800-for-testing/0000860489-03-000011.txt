LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                                   June 25, 2003

Dear Shareholder,
   We are pleased to report that for the first six months  ended April 30, 2003,
the Central  European Equity Fund's net asset value per share rose 12.9%,  while
the Fund's  benchmark  rose 12.7% in US dollar  terms.  The region  continues to
outperform  developed  markets;  during the same period,  the S&P 500 Index rose
3.5% and the MSCI Europe Index rose 2.7%.
   Russia was the best  performing  country from the Fund's  portfolio,  gaining
over 20% during the six month period in US dollar terms.  Yukos  announced  last
month it agreed to merge with the Russian  oil company  Sibneft to create one of
the world's  largest oil companies.  Its shares rose over 26%. While Russian oil
and gas stocks continued to perform well, all other sectors  performed  strongly
as well. The Fund's two telecommunications stocks were both up over 40% in local
terms.  Norilsk  Nickel,  the metals and mining company rose almost 15%, and the
Fund's shares in a tracking vehicle for the Russian bank Sberbank rose more than
22%. The ADR shares of Unified Energy System,  the electric  utilities  company,
rose over 47%. In our  opinion,  the  breadth of the market  rally is a positive
sign of the sustainability of strong global interest in Russia's equity market.
   In  April,  Hungary  became  one of the  first  countries  to  hold a  public
referendum  on  joining  the  European  Union.  The  Hungarian  market  slightly
outperformed  the region,  rising 14.1% in US dollar  terms.  Economically,  the
country  continues to do well.  OTP Bank's GDR shares rose 22.3% during the same
period, MATAV, the telecommunications  company rose 25%, and Gedeon Richter, the
pharmaceutical company, GDR shares rose over 40%.
   The Czech Republic rose 9.7% during the six month period,  with the strongest
performance  coming from Unipetrol,  which rose over 44%. Poland's equity market
underperformed the region,  rising just 1.2% in US dollar terms. Poland is still
suffering from the central  bank's  excessive  monetary  tightening 2 years ago.
Since then, the central bank has reversed  course and lowered  interest rates 21
times.  Poland's  economic  growth  this year is expected to double the level of
growth achieved last year.
   At the May 9, 2003 meeting, the Board of Directors of your Fund moved to take
advantage of the positive  changes that we believe are taking place in Russia by
approving  increased  flexibility  for  the  Fund  to  invest  in  Russia.  This
recommendation was approved by shareholders at the June 24, 2003 Annual Meeting.
The changes establish a fundamental  policy to invest at least 80% of the Fund's
net assets in both Central Europe and Russia. The Fund's name is changing to The
Central Europe and Russia Fund, Inc. Its NYSE ticker symbol will remain "CEE."
   Also at the May 9th Board Meeting, the Board of Directors elected Mr. Fred H.
Langhammer,  President and Chief Executive Officer of The Estee Lauder Companies
Inc., and Mr. Eggert Voscherau, Vice Chairman of BASF as Directors of your Fund,
replacing  retiring  Directors Dr. Juergen Strube and Hans Storr. Last July, Mr.
Otto Wolff von Amerongen  also retired as Director of the Fund.  Mr.  Langhammer
had previously been Managing  Director of Estee Lauder Germany.  He was educated
in Germany,  Canada and Japan,  and is now based in New York.  Mr.  Voscherau is
based in Germany.
   We believe the Fund  continues to be an  attractive  investment  opportunity.
Economic  growth  outpaces  other  European  markets  while  valuations   remain
attractive.
   Sincerely,




   /S/ SIGNATURE           /S/ SIGNATURE

INTERVIEW WITH THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

QUESTION:  How  attractive  are the  countries  that  are  expected  to join the
European Union after their strong outperformance over the past 2 years?

ANSWER:  The equity  markets of Poland,  Hungary and the Czech  Republic  remain
attractive.  Economic  growth for the region is  expected  to be higher than the
average for the world  economy  for three  reasons.  First,  the region has been
receiving  large amounts of foreign  direct  investment.  Central Europe is very
attractive  to companies  seeking to expand into  untapped  markets and to those
looking to take advantage of relatively cheap labor. Second, interest rates have
been gradually converging to the levels of Western Europe.  Historically,  lower
interest rates make investment  projects more attractive and stimulate  economic
activity. Third, emerging economies joining the European Union have historically
benefited  from  the  affiliation  with  the  more  developed  Western  European
countries.

QUESTION:  What  will  be the  benefits  of the  proposed  reduction  in  Polish
Corporate Income Tax?

ANSWER:  The Polish  Government has proposed to reduce the corporate  income tax
(CIT) to 19%, down eight  percentage  points from the current 27%.  Although its
passage is still  uncertain,  if approved this cut could have a strong effect on
corporate  earnings,  employment and economic growth. The proposal must still be
approved by the government and the Parliament, but current sentiment leads us to
believe it will pass by the end of the year.  The tax cut will be  dependent  on
the removal of all tax breaks, allowances and deductions that reduce the nominal
income tax. The  government  estimated the 2003  effective tax rate to be 23.7%,
reducing the underlying tax reduction to 4.7%, still a meaningful reduction. The
lower CIT may improve Poland's  competitive position relative to other countries
in the region and may give an added boost to the Polish equity  market.  A lower
tax rate could also attract foreign investors and increase the number of foreign
firms looking to do business in Poland.

QUESTION: What is the progress of the 10 candidate countries in becoming members
of the European Union?

ANSWER: The EU membership  negotiations are making good progress.  By the end of
the summer, all the candidate countries are expected to have held referendums to
get the public's  approval to join the EU. To date, 7 countries  have  completed
this  task with  success.  Hungary's  referendum  was held in April and 83.8% of
those voting voted in favor of joining the EU. In Poland,  77.5% voted in favor,
and in the Czech Republic 77.3% also voted in favor.  The other four  countries,
Malta,  Slovenia,  Slovakia and Lithuania,  all showed strong public support for
joining  the EU. The  accession  to the EU  represents  a strong  anchor for the
candidate  countries'  economic and structural  policies.  Foreign investors are
increasingly  realizing this, as fund flows (representing  direct investment and
portfolio  investments)  have reached  record levels in Poland,  Hungary and the
Czech Republic.  It is our belief that these countries should be able to realize
even  higher  growth  rates  than the EU itself if they  continue  to  implement
further structural  reforms. It is this higher growth potential that makes these
countries very attractive to invest in.

REPORT FROM THE INVESTMENT ADVISER AND MANAGER
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ECONOMIC OUTLOOK FOR THE CENTRAL
EUROPEAN ECONOMIES

POLAND
On May 28th,  Poland's central bank reduced its main interest rate for the fifth
time this year after a steep decline in inflation.  Poland's  intervention  rate
now stands at a record low of 5.5%,  while two years ago the  intervention  rate
stood at 19%. The steep reduction in borrowing costs helped pull the economy out
of its worst  slowdown  since the end of communism.  We are basing our portfolio
decisions  on the view  that  reduction  in  interest  rates  will  continue  as
inflation has been brought down from its peak of 11.6% in July 2000, to a record
low of 0.3% this past April.  For 2003, we expect Poland's economy to grow 2.6%,
more than  twice the 1.2%  growth  achieved  during  2002.  The  effects  of the
interest  rates cuts take time to work their way into the economy and their full
effects  will be felt in 2004,  with an estimated  GDP growth of 4.0%.  Poland's
current  account  deficit is expected to remain below 4% of GDP this year on the
back of strong  exports.  In USD terms,  exports were up 33% year on year ending
February,  while  imports were up 17%. On June 8th,  Poland held a referendum on
Poland's entry into the European  Union,  with 77.5% of those voting  supporting
accession to the EU.

HUNGARY
Hungary has continued to be the best  performing  country in the region in terms
of economic activity,  with estimated GDP growth of 3.6% this year and 4.1% next
year. In addition,  there has been a significant  decline in inflation,  falling
from 9.2% in 2001 to 5.1% this year.  Hungary's  economic  performance  has been
quite  extraordinary  given the country's  large  exposure to foreign trade with
Western  Europe.   Hungary  has   successfully   stimulated   domestic   demand,
particularly  the  construction  and service  sectors,  through its loose fiscal
policy.  Private consumption  benefited from wage hikes in the public sector and
large-scale public investment projects.  Many of these large public projects are
being  funded by the  substantial  amounts of foreign  capital  that Hungary has
attracted  over the past few years.  Hungary was one of the first  countries  to
hold a  referendum  on joining  the  European  Union,  with 84% of those  voting
supporting accession.

RUSSIA
Russia's  economic  performance has been both remarkably  strong and stable over
the  past  couple  of  years,  at a  time  when  most  economies  experienced  a
considerable  drop-off in economic  performance.  In 2002, Russia's economy grew
4.3% and is  expected to grow 4.2% both this year and in 2004.  Economic  growth
over the next 2 years is expected to be  significantly  higher than in developed
Europe  and the US.  The key factor in the  strong  performance  of the  Russian
economy  has been oil and  natural  gas  exports.  The oil riches  have not only
fueled the real  economy,  but they have also  improved  the  Russian  financial
situation.  Russia is one of the few  countries  in the world with  surpluses in
both the federal budget and the current account. As a result, Russia was able to
repay some of its foreign debts before  maturity and raise its foreign  exchange
reserves to $44 billion.  Russia is potentially  the biggest oil producer in the
world and it could become over time the biggest oil  exporter.  In this respect,
three developments are noteworthy.  First, the $6.75 billion investment by BP in
a joint venture with three Russian oil companies  represents  the biggest single
direct  investment in Russia.  Second,  a political  decision to build a private
pipeline  and expand port  facilities  in Murmansk are aimed at  increasing  oil
exports to the US.  Third,  a merger of two big Russian oil  companies,  with an
output of 24 million barrels per day, will become the fifth biggest oil producer
in the world. To reduce the country's dependence on oil, the minister of finance
has  submitted a proposal to create a  stabilization  fund that would be used to
cushion the economy from the negative impact of potentially lower oil proceeds.

CZECH REPUBLIC
The Czech  economy has continued to perform  relatively  well,  considering  the
persistent  weakness in Western  Europe.  The initial data for 2002 were revised
upwards as the  negative  impact of last year's  flooding has  diminished.  Real
growth in 2002 was 2.5%,  and the outlook calls for growth of 3.0% this year and
3.6% in 2004, as both monetary and fiscal policies remain stimulative. The Czech
National Bank began easing interest rates relatively early, and together with an
expansionary   fiscal  policy  provided  sufficient  stimulus  to  the  economy.
Inflation  has been  subdued,  falling  from  4.8% in 2001 to 1.2% this year and
unemployment has also been gradually  declining,  falling from 8.5% last year to
8.0% this year. The Czech Republic held its public  referendum on joining the EU
on June 15th, with 77.3% in favor.

VOLUNTARY CASH PURCHASE PROGRAM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Fund has an attractive way to purchase additional shares at reduced cost.
This is the  Voluntary  Cash  Purchase  Program  which  is part of the  Dividend
Reinvestment Plan. By enrolling in the Voluntary Cash Purchase Program,  you may
make  additional  investments  each month--as  little as $100 in any month or as
much as $36,000 a year.  Share  purchases  are  combined to receive a beneficial
brokerage  fee. The Voluntary  Cash Purchase  Program and Dividend  Reinvestment
Plan has been amended to allow  enrollment in the Plan by making an initial cash
deposit of at least $250 with the plan agent.

PRIVACY POLICY AND PRACTICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(stockholders) with respect to their transactions in shares of the Fund but only
for those  stockholders  whose shares are  registered in their names.  We do not

THE CENTRAL EUROPEAN EQUITY FUND, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--APRIL 30, 2003 (UNAUDITED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


NOTE 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Central  European Equity Fund, Inc.  (formerly The Future Germany Fund, Inc.
or  the  "Fund")  commenced  investment   operations  on  March  6,  1990  as  a
non-diversified,   closed-end  management  investment  company  incorporated  in
Maryland.  Pursuant to shareholder approvals, on June 29, 1995, the Fund changed
its name and  investment  objective  to allow  investment  in  Central  European
countries,  and on June 20, 1997,  the Fund changed its  investment  policies to
permit  increased  flexibility  in the  geographic  distribution  of the  Fund's
investments.

The following is a summary of significant  accounting  policies  followed by the
Fund  in the  preparation  of  its  financial  statements.  The  preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United  States of  America  requires  management  to make  estimates  and
assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY  VALUATION:  Investments are stated at value.  All securities for which
market  quotations  are readily  available are valued at the last sales price on
the primary exchange on which they are traded prior to the time of valuation. If
no sales  price is  available  at that  time,  and both bid and ask  prices  are
available,  the  securities  are valued at the mean between the last current bid
and ask prices; if no quoted asked prices are available,  they are valued at the
last  quoted bid price.  All  securities  for which  market  quotations  are not
readily  available  will be valued as  determined  in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Fund.

SECURITIES  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME:  Securities  transactions  are
recorded on the trade date.  Cost of  securities  sold is  calculated  using the
identified cost method.  Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest  income is  recorded  on an  accrual  basis.  Such  dividend  income is
recorded net of unrecoverable foreign withholding tax.

LOANS OF PORTFOLIO  SECURITIES:  The Fund may lend portfolio securities while it
continues  to earn  dividends  on such  securities  loaned.  The market value of
government securities received as collateral is required to be at least equal to
105  percent  of  the  market  value  of  the  securities   loaned,   which  are
marked-to-market daily. Securities lending fees, net of rebates and agency fees,
are  earned  by the Fund  and are  identified  separately  in the  Statement  of
Operations.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: The books and  records of the Fund are  maintained
in United States dollars.

Assets and liabilities  denominated in euros and other foreign  currency amounts
are  translated  into United States  dollars at the 10:00 A.M.  mid-point of the
buying and selling  spot rates  quoted by the Federal  Reserve Bank of New York.
Purchases and sales of investment  securities,  income and expenses are reported
at the rate of exchange prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions.
The  resultant  gains and losses  arising from exchange  rate  fluctuations  are
identified  separately in the Statement of  Operations,  except for such amounts
attributable to  investments,  which are included in net realized and unrealized
gains and losses on investments.

Foreign  investments may involve certain  considerations and risks not typically
associated  with those of  domestic  origin as a result of,  among  others,  the
possibility of political and economic developments and the level of governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets.  In addition,  certain
foreign markets may be substantially  smaller,  less developed,  less liquid and
more volatile than the major markets of the United States.

In the normal course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of representations which provide general indemnifications.  The Fund's
maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is unknown as this would  involve
future  claims  that may be made  against  the Fund that have not yet  occurred.
However, based on experience, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

TAXES:  No provision has been made for United States  Federal income tax because
the Fund intends to meet the  requirements of the United States Internal Revenue
Code   applicable   to  regulated   investment   companies   and  to  distribute
substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders.

DIVIDENDS AND  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO  SHAREHOLDERS:  The Fund records  dividends and
distributions  to its shareholders on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and capital
gain  distributions  are  determined  in accordance  with United States  Federal
income tax  regulations  which may differ from accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United  States of  America.  These  differences,  which could be
temporary   or  permanent  in  nature,   may  result  in   reclassification   of
distributions; however, net investment income, net realized gains and net assets
are not affected.

NOTE 2. MANAGEMENT AND INVESTMENT
ADVISORY AGREEMENTS
The Fund has a Management  Agreement  with  Deutsche Bank  Securities  Inc. (the
"Manager"),  and an Investment Advisory Agreement with Deutsche Asset Management
International  GmbH (the "Investment  Adviser").  The Manager and the Investment

The Management  Agreement  provides the Manager with a fee,  computed weekly and

average  weekly net assets up to $100  million and .25% of such assets in excess
of $100 million.

Pursuant to the Management  Agreement,  the Manager is the corporate manager and
administrator  of the Fund  and,  subject  to the  supervision  of the  Board of
Directors and pursuant to recommendations made by the Fund's Investment Adviser,
determines the suitable  securities for investment by the Fund. The Manager also
provides office facilities and certain administrative,  clerical and bookkeeping
services  for the Fund.  Pursuant  to the  Investment  Advisory  Agreement,  the
Investment Adviser,  in accordance with the Fund's stated investment  objective,
policies and restrictions,  makes recommendations to the Manager with respect to
the  Fund's  investments  and,  upon  instructions  given by the  Manager  as to
suitable  securities  for  investment by the Fund,  transmits  purchase and sale

++ Total  investment  return based on market value is  calculated  assuming that
   shares of the Fund's common stock were  purchased at the closing market price
   as of  the  begin-ning  of the  year,  dividends,  capital  gains  and  other
   distributions  were  reinvested  as  provided  for  in  the  Fund's  dividend
   reinvestment  plan and then sold at the closing market price per share on the
   last day of the year. The computation  does not reflect any sales  commission
   investors may incur in purchasing  or selling  shares of the Fund.  The total
   investment  return based on the net asset value is similarly  computed except
   that the Fund's net asset value is substituted for the closing market value.

   balances.  The ratios of total expenses after custody  credits to average net
   assets are 1.50%,  1.54%, 1.62%, 1.35%, 1.43% and 1.17% for 2003, 2002, 2001,
   2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.
