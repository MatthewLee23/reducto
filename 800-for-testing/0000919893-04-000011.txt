Franklin Templeton Investments

GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the specialized
expertise of three world-class investment management groups--Franklin, Templeton
and Mutual Series.


SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE

Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying on its
own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines that underlie
its success.

FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a leader in tax-free investing and a
driving force in fixed income investing around the globe. They also bring
expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity investing.

TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing and, in
1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today, with
research offices in over 25 countries, they offer investors the broadest global
reach in the industry.

MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style of
value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among undervalued
stocks, arbitrage situations and distressed companies.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION

Because our management groups work independently and adhere to distinctly
different investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
typically have a low overlap of securities. That's why our funds can be used to
build truly diversified portfolios covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST

At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the
reliable account services that have helped us become one of the most trusted
names in financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months ended June 30, 2004, Templeton Dragon Fund posted cumulative
total returns of -18.89% in market price terms and +0.12% in net asset value
terms, as the Fund's market price declined more than the Fund's net asset value.
You can find the Fund's long-term performance in the Performance Summary
beginning on page 5.


ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Overall, China's economy grew 9.8% in first quarter 2004 compared with first
quarter 2003 on the strength of investments in factories, real estate and other
fixed assets.1 During the six months under review, the Chinese government
implemented measures to cool the booming economy. These measures included
raising reserve requirements for some commercial banks and capping bank lending
for the funding of steel, aluminum and cement projects, as well as price
controls on provincial governments in a bid to stem inflation. Although
government officials said that reduced investment and credit tightening policies
slowed growth, an increase in lending rates was expected as inflation registered
4.4% in May 2004, slightly below the 5% threshold set by the Central Bank.

Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian commenced his second term in office in May
2004. In his inaugural speech, Chen reiterated plans to amend the island's
constitution, but scrapped plans for a public referendum to impose a new
constitution. Aimed at improving Taiwan's infrastructure and service sectors,
the government approved plans to spend US$15 billion over the next five years.
Taiwan's first quarter 2004 gross domestic product (GDP) grew 6.3%, faster than
the 5.2% in fourth quarter 2003 as strengthening domestic demand and robust
exports boosted the economy.2

In 2004, Hong Kong continued its economic recovery as first quarter GDP grew
6.8%, mainly due to strengthening exports, booming tourism and rising domestic
spending. The government expected overall 2004 GDP growth to be 6%, up from 3.3%
last year. In line with the city's recovery, unemployment also improved, with
the rate falling to 7.0% in May 2004, down from a high of 8.7% in July 2003.

In early 2004, markets in the greater China region recorded positive
performances as investor optimism continued from 2003 into the new year.
However, concerns that China's economy could experience a hard landing, rising
interest rates in the

U.S., the situation in Iraq, and high and rising oil prices rattled investor
confidence. Thus, despite the continuation of generally positive economic
developments, stock market performances in the region declined in the second
half of the reporting period and ended the six-month period down overall.


INVESTMENT STRATEGY

Our investment strategy employs a fundamental, value-oriented, long-term
approach. In selecting companies for investment, we will consider overall growth
prospects, competitive positions in export markets, technologies, research and
development, productivity, labor costs, raw material costs and sources, profit
margins, returns on investment, capital resources, government regulation,
management and other factors in comparison to other companies around the world
which we believe are comparable.

Our approach to selecting investments emphasizes fundamental company-by-company
analysis (rather than broader analyses of specific industries or sectors of the
economy), to construct an "action list" from which we make our buy decisions.
Although we will consider historical value measures, the primary factor in
selecting securities for investment by the Fund will be the company's current
price relative to its long-term earnings potential.


MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

During the six months under review, the Morgan Stanley Capital International
(MSCI) China Index (the Index) posted -10.76% return in U.S. dollar terms, as
China-related stocks' performance belied the bright economic growth statistics.3
Our decision to hold Dairy Farm International and Hang Lung Group, which are not
in the Index, as well as the Fund's underweighted position in China Life
Insurance (sold by period-end) relative to the Index, benefited the Fund's
relative performance during the period. However, the Fund's overweighted
positions in TCL International Holdings and Sinopec hindered relative
performance. TCL is one of the largest manufacturers of television sets,
telecommunications products, personal computers and other electronic products in
China. Consistent with our strategy, we continued to hold TCL because we
believed the company is well positioned to benefit over the long term from
China's growing demand for consumer goods. Regarding Sinopec, our concerns over
the sustainability of high oil prices had already led us to reduce and then
eliminate our exposure to the company during the reporting period.

By industry, the Fund's overweighted position relative to the Index in the real
estate sector, as well as an underweighted position in the automobile sector,
contributed to the Fund's relative performance during the period. Alternatively,
underweighted positions in the wireless telecommunication services and oil and
gas sectors hindered performance relative to the Index.

We reduced the Fund's exposure to the oil and gas sector during the period as
holdings reached sell price targets. Key sales included the aforementioned
Sinopec, as well as PetroChina and Beijing Yanhua Petrochemical. We had concerns
regarding the sustainability of high commodity prices, especially oil, and we
believed selling these holdings was prudent. Largely as a result of such sales,
the Fund's exposure to China "H" shares decreased during the period. China H
shares are Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies. The Fund also divested its
Singapore Airlines position as the stock reached our price target, thereby
eliminating the Fund's exposure to Singapore by period-end.

The Fund increased its holdings in Taiwan through purchases in Mega Financial
Holdings, one of Taiwan's largest financial holding companies, and Acer, one of
the market leaders in Europe's notebook computer market. Elsewhere, key
purchases included HSBC Holdings, a U.K.-based global banking group with
significant businesses in emerging markets, especially Hong Kong; China Mobile,
the world's largest mobile telephone operator; and China International Marine
Containers, one of the world's dominant manufacturers of shipping containers.

We thank you for your interest in Templeton Dragon Fund, welcome your questions
and comments and look forward to serving your investment needs in the years
ahead.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. (the Fund), is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company. The
Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation by investing at least 45% of its total
assets in the equity securities of "China companies," as defined in the Fund's
prospectus.

On May 29, 2002, the Fund's shareholders approved an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") that provides for the reorganization of the Fund
from a Maryland corporation to a Delaware statutory trust. The completion of the
reorganization is pending guidance from the National Tax Agency in Japan
relating to the tax treatment of the Plan under Japanese laws with respect to
the Fund's Japanese shareholders. If and when the reorganization is completed,
the Delaware statutory trust will be the successor to the Fund.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange are valued at the
last reported sales price. Securities listed or traded on NASDAQ are valued at
their official closing price. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities
for which no sale is reported are valued within the range of the latest quoted
bid and asked prices by independent pricing services or recognized dealers in
such securities. Foreign securities are valued at the close of trading of the
foreign exchange or the NYSE, whichever is earlier. If events occur that
materially affect the values of securities after the prices or foreign exchange
rates are determined, but prior to 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or the close of
trading on the NYSE, whichever is earlier, or if market quotations are deemed
not readily available or reliable, the securities will be valued at fair value.
Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset value.
All security valuation procedures are approved by the Board of Directors.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities and income items denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.



                                                          Semiannual Report | 13
<PAGE>
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)


1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION (CONTINUED)

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes, and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate on a specified date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income. Fund distributions to
shareholders are determined on a tax basis and may differ from net investment
income and realized gains for financial reporting purposes.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Certain income from foreign securities is recorded as soon as information is
available to the Fund. Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily.
Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.


2. CAPITAL STOCK

At June 30, 2004, there were 100 million shares authorized ($.01 par value).

On May 22, 2003, the Fund, purchased pursuant to a tender offer, and retired
certain amounts of its outstanding common stock. The Fund incurred tender costs,
which were charged to additional paid-in-capital. Tender offer transactions were
as follows:

                                          -------------
                                          MAY 22, 2003*
                                          -------------
Shares repurchased and retired .....        6,656,425
Purchase price .....................            $9.97
Percentage of net asset value ......            92.5%
Tender costs incurred ..............         $167,136

*See Note 8 regarding Recent Litigation

During the period ended June 30, 2004, 50,373 shares were issued for $857,854
from reinvested distributions.


3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Certain officers of the Fund are also officers or directors of the following
entities:

- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ENTITY                                              AFFILIATION
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Templeton Asset Management Ltd. (TAML)              Investment manager
  Franklin Templeton Services, LLC (FT Services)      Administrative manager

The Fund pays an investment management fee to TAML of 1.25% per year of the
average weekly net assets of the Fund.

The Fund pays FT Services an administrative fee of 0.15% per year of the Fund's
average weekly net assets, of which 0.10% is paid to Nomura Asset Management
U.S.A., Inc., for sub-administrative services.

4. EXPENSE OFFSET ARRANGEMENT

The Fund has entered into an arrangement with its custodian whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a portion of
the Fund's custodian expenses. During the period ended June 30, 2004, the
custodian fees were reduced as noted in the Statement of Operations.


5. INCOME TAXES

At June 30, 2004, the net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) based on the
cost of investments for income tax purposes was as follows:

Cost of investments ...................................     $455,519,500
                                                            -------------
Unrealized appreciation ...............................     $185,146,874
Unrealized depreciation ...............................      (16,427,010)
                                                            -------------
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) ............     $168,719,864
                                                            -------------


Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatment of wash sales and foreign currency
transactions.

At December 31, 2003, the Fund had tax basis capital losses of $45,572,045 which
may be carried over to offset future capital gains. Such losses expire in 2009.


6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short-term securities) for the
period ended June 30, 2004 aggregated $74,739,391 and $97,740,384, respectively.


7. INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Franklin Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market
Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Franklin Advisers Inc. (an affiliate of the Fund's investment manager).
Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the Sweep
Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the Sweep
Money Fund.

8. RECENT LITIGATION

On January 29, 2003, the Fund, together with Templeton China World Fund, Inc.
("China Fund"), another closed-end management investment company in Franklin
Templeton Investments, and TAML, the investment adviser to the Fund and China
Fund, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland, Northern Division, against Harvard College, Harvard Management
Company, Inc. ("Harvard Management"), which is an investment advisor to Harvard
College, and Steven Alperin, an officer of Harvard Management (referred to
collectively as "Harvard"). The complaint alleged that Harvard violated several
provisions of the Federal securities laws and the rules of the SEC related to
Harvard's ownership of Fund shares and actions as a shareholder. On February 7,
2003, Harvard counterclaimed, alleging that the Fund, China Fund, TAML and each
fund's directors violated certain provisions of the Federal securities laws and
SEC rules. Harvard also asserted counterclaims of breach of fiduciary duty under
Maryland state law against TAML and each fund's directors. On March 20, 2003,
the parties announced a settlement of their claims.

DISMISSAL OF LAWSUIT. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement between the Fund and
Harvard, the complaint brought by the Fund, China Fund and TAML against Harvard,
as well as the counterclaims brought by Harvard against the Fund, China Fund,
each fund's directors and TAML were dismissed without prejudice. The parties
have also entered into covenants not to sue each other with respect to the
claims that were made or could have been made in the litigation absent a breach
of the settlement agreements.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS. As part of the settlement, Harvard College agreed to
withdraw all of its shareholder proposals for the Fund's 2003 Annual
Shareholders' meeting (the "Meeting.")

TENDER OFFERS. The Fund announced that as part of its settlement with Harvard,
it agreed to take, and the Board approved, the following actions:

  o  APRIL 2003 CASH TENDER OFFER--The Fund agreed to commence a cash tender
     offer, which was required to be commenced on or prior to April 30, 2003,
     for 15% of the Fund's outstanding shares at 92.5% of net asset value per
     share as of the date the offer expires. Previously, the Board had approved
     an April 2003 cash tender offer for not less than 10% of the Fund's
     outstanding shares at not less than 90% of net asset value per share. On
     April 24, 2003, the Fund commenced a tender offer for up to 6,656,425
     shares, or 15%, of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price per share equal
     to 92.5% of net asset value per share as of May 22, 2003, the expiration
     date of the tender offer. In accordance with the terms of the tender offer,
     6,656,425 shares were accepted by the Fund for a purchase price of $9.97
     per share.


                                                          Semiannual Report | 17
<PAGE>
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

8. RECENT LITIGATION (CONTINUED)

  o  IN-KIND TENDER OFFERS--The Fund has applied to the SEC for an exemptive
     order allowing the Fund to make occasional, non-periodic tender offers,
     each for up to 20% of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price equal to 95%
     of net asset value per share as of the date the offer expires, to be paid
     entirely in kind through a pro rata distribution of marketable portfolio
     securities and available cash. Subject to certain conditions, the
     settlement requires the Fund to commence such an in-kind tender offer for
     20% of the Fund's shares within three months after obtaining the SEC
     exemption. The Fund may also be required under the settlement to conduct,
     on substantially identical terms, up to two additional in-kind tender
     offers under certain circumstances. There is no assurance that the SEC will
     issue the exemptive order, nor is it possible to predict the date when an
     exemptive order might be granted.

  o  ADDITIONAL CASH TENDER OFFERS--If the SEC does not issue the exemptive
     order for in-kind tender offers by March 26, 2004, the settlement provides
     that the Fund may, but is not obligated to, conduct an additional cash
     tender offer, and possibly later follow-on cash tender offers, each for 15%
     of the Fund's outstanding shares at a price of 92.5% of net asset value per
     share as of the date the offer expires. Under certain circumstances, if the
     Fund does not conduct these tender offers, Harvard will be relieved of its
     obligation to refrain from making shareholder proposals and taking other
     actions with respect to the Fund. The exemptive application was not
     received by March 26, 2004 and the Fund has not conducted a tender offer in
     2004.

Harvard announced that it intends to tender all of the shares it then owns into
each tender offer described above that is commenced.

The Settlement Agreement provides that the Fund will not be obligated to
commence in-kind tender offers or additional cash tender offers under certain
circumstances or conditions. These relate to, among other things, the number of
shares tendered by shareholders into preceding tender offers as well as the
beneficial ownership percentages of the Fund's shareholders.

STANDSTILL. As part of the settlement, Harvard agreed not to submit any
proposals for consideration by shareholders of the Fund, or any other closed-end
fund or similar investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates, or for
consideration by shareholders of Franklin Resources, nor to encourage others to
do so, for a period of four years. Harvard also has agreed not at any time to
acquire additional shares of the Fund or any other closed-end fund or similar
investment vehicle managed by TAML or its affiliates.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS

MASSACHUSETTS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
On February 4, 2004, the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an administrative complaint against
Franklin Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Company")
claiming violations of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act ("Massachusetts
Act") with respect to an alleged arrangement to permit market timing (the "Mass.
Proceeding"). On February 17, 2004, the Company filed an answer denying all
violations of the Massachusetts Act.

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) SETTLEMENT
On August 2, 2004, the Company announced that an agreement had been reached by
an affiliate of the Fund's investment manager with the SEC that resolved the
issues resulting from the SEC's investigation of market timing activity. The SEC
issued an "order instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings
pursuant to sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
and sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, making
findings and imposing remedial sanctions and a cease and desist order" (the
"Order"). The SEC's Order concerns the activities of a limited number of third
parties that ended in 2000 and those that are the subject of the Mass.
Proceeding described above.

Under the terms of the SEC's Order, pursuant to which an affiliate of the Fund's
investment manager neither admits nor denies any wrongdoing, an affiliate of the
Fund's investment manager has agreed to pay $50 million, of which $20 million is
a civil penalty, to be distributed to certain fund shareholders in accordance
with a plan to be developed by an Independent Distribution Consultant. At this
time, it is unclear whether shareholders of all funds will receive distributions
or whether all shareholders of any particular fund will receive distributions.
The SEC Order also requires an affiliate of the Fund's investment manager to,
among other things, enhance and periodically review compliance policies and
procedures.

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS
As part of ongoing investigations by the SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern
District of California, the New York Attorney General, the California Attorney
General, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, the Florida
Department of Financial Services and the Commissioner of Securities, the West
Virginia Attorney General, the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance,
Securities, and Health Care Administration and the National Association of
Securities Dealers, relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry,
including late trading, market timing and payments to securities dealers who
sell fund shares, the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current
or former executives and employees of the Company, have received requests for
information and/or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company has
been providing documents and information in response to these requests and
subpoenas. In addition, the Company has responded to requests for similar kinds
of information from regulatory authorities in some of the foreign countries
where the Company conducts its global asset management business.

9. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

OTHER GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS (CONTINUED)
The Staff of the SEC has also informed the Company that it is considering
recommending a civil action or proceeding against an affiliate of the Fund's
investment manager and Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. concerning payments
to securities dealers who sell fund shares (commonly referred to as "revenue
sharing"). The staff of the California Attorney General's Office (CAGO) also has
advised the Company that it is authorized to bring a civil action against
Franklin Resources, Inc. and Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc. arising from
the same events. Even though the Company currently believes that the charges the
SEC staff and CAGO staff are contemplating are unwarranted, it also believes
that it is in the best interest of the Company and fund shareholders to resolve
these issues voluntarily, to the extent the Company can reasonably do so.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
The Company, in addition to other entities within Franklin Templeton
Investments, including certain of its subsidiaries, other funds, and current and
former officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits
in different federal courts in Nevada, California, Illinois, New York and
Florida, alleging violations of various federal securities laws and seeking,
among other things, monetary damages and costs. Specifically, the lawsuits claim
breach of duty with respect to alleged arrangements to permit market timing
and/or late trading activity, or breach of duty with respect to the valuation of
the portfolio securities of certain funds managed by Company subsidiaries,
resulting in alleged market timing activity. The majority of these lawsuits
duplicate, in whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the Mass. Proceeding
detailed above. The lawsuits are styled as class actions or derivative actions
on behalf of either the named funds or the Company.

In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current and
former officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits
alleging violations of various securities laws and pendent state law claims
relating to the disclosure of directed brokerage payments and/or payment of
allegedly excessive commissions and advisory fees. These lawsuits are styled as
class actions and derivative actions.

The Company's management strongly believes that the claims made in each of these
lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of the foregoing
Mass. Proceeding, other governmental investigations or other legal proceedings.
The impact, if any, of these matters on the Fund is uncertain at this time. If
the Company determines that it bears responsibility for any unlawful or
inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is committed to making
the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc.

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

If shares of the Fund are held in the shareholder's name, the shareholder will
automatically be a participant in the Plan (other than shareholders holding
their shares through Japan Securities Clearing Corporation, who will not be
enrolled in the Plan unless certain conditions are met and they elect to
participate), unless he elects to withdraw. If the shares are registered in the
name of a broker-dealer or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), the
broker-dealer or nominee will elect to participate in the Plan on the
shareholder's behalf unless the shareholder instructs them otherwise, or unless
the reinvestment service is not provided by the broker-dealer or nominee.

Participants should contact Mellon Investor Services LLC, P.O. Box 3338, South
Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938, to receive the Plan brochure.

To receive dividends or distributions in cash, the shareholder must notify
Mellon Bank, N.A. (the "Plan Administrator") at the address above or the
institution in whose name the shares are held. The Plan Agent must receive
written notice within 10 business days before the record date for the
distribution.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or common stock of the Fund,
if the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation
date, the participant will receive the dividends entirely in stock at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to "Mellon Bank, N.A." and sent to
Mellon Investor Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA 15250-8009, Attn:
Templeton Dragon Fund, Inc. The Plan Administrator shall apply such payments
(less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of trading fees) to
purchases of the Fund's shares in the open market.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax which may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

The participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by
written notice to the Plan Administrator sent to Mellon Investor Services LLC,
P.O. Box 3338, South Hackensack, NJ 07606-1938. Upon withdrawal, the participant
will receive, without charge, stock certificates issued in the participant's
name for all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant
wishes, the Plan Administrator will sell the participant's shares and send the
proceeds, less a service charge and less trading fees. Effective April 23, 2004,
the fees for the sale of shares through the Plan are $15.00 per transaction plus
a $0.12 per share trading fee. All other terms and conditions of the Plan remain
in effect and have not been modified or amended.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of directors of the Fund has  delegated  the authority to vote proxies
related  to the  portfolio  securities  held by the Fund to the  Fund's  manager
Templeton Asset  Management Ltd in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors and employees of the Fund, the manager and the Proxy
Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with
the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. All conflicts are resolved in
the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the manager
perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's board of directors; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of directors, ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services; or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS. In light of several high profile accounting scandals,
the manager will closely scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a
case-by-case basis, the manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit
relationships and non-audit fees. The manager will also consider, on a
case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and will vote against the
ratification of auditors when there is clear and compelling evidence of
accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT & DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans and/or the Glass Lewis
evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders. The manager will
review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies on
expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Shareholders may view the complete Policies on-line at franklintempleton.com.
Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the Policies free of charge by
calling the Proxy Group collect at 1-954/847-2268 or by sending a written
request to: Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC, 500 East Broward Boulevard, Suite
1500, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, Attention: Proxy Group. Copies of the Fund's
proxy voting records are available on-line at franklintempleton.com and posted
on the SEC website at www.sec.gov and reflect the twelve-month period beginning
July 1, 2003, and ending June 30, 2004.

Threa have been no changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend
nominees to the Registrant's Board of Directors that would require disclosure

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes
in the Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could
significantly affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their
evaluation in connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR.

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons  identified in the Code;  and o  Accountability  for
       adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II. COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes with the interests of, or his service to, the FT Funds. For
example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer, or a member of
his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his position with
the FT Funds.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
       influence  investment decisions or financial reporting by the FT Funds
       whereby the Covered Officer would benefit  personally to the detriment
       of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report at least  annually the  following  affiliations  or  other
       relationships:/2

     o all  directorships for public companies and all companies that  are
       required to file reports with the SEC;

     o any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
       directors;

     o any direct or indirect business  relationship with any independent public
       accounting firm; and

     o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund that
       will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from the
       advisory, sub-advisory,  distribution  or service agreements  with
       affiliates of Franklin Resources).

      There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include/3:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related,  reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any  question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval for any entertainment with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
       charges  or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
       equity ownership.

  FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly  misrepresent,  or cause others
       to misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside  the  FT  Funds,  including  to the FT  Funds'  directors  and
       auditors,   and  to   governmental   regulators  and   self-regulatory
       organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
       responsibility,  consult with other  officers and  employees of the FT
       Funds,  the adviser and the  administrator  with the goal of promoting
       full,  fair,  accurate,  timely and  understandable  disclosure in the
       reports and  documents  the FT Funds file with,  or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions  imposed by applicable laws, rules
       and regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
       Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
       read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he
       knows of any  violation of this Code.  Failure to do so is itself is a
       violation of this Code.

      FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation./4/
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers/5/ sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.

      The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

     o FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
       action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;

     o If, after such  investigation, FT's General  Counsel or Deputy  General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred,  FT's General Counsel
       is not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes
       is a violation  will be reported to the  Independent  Directors of the
       appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the  Independent  Directors  concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation  to the Board of the appropriate
       Funds,  which will  consider  appropriate  action,  which may  include
       review of, and appropriate  modifications to, applicable  policies and
       procedures;  notification  to appropriate  personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board;  or a  recommendation  to  dismiss  the  Covered
       Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

     This  Code  shall be the sole code of  ethics  adopted  by the FT Funds for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable  to registered  investment  companies  there under.  Insofar as other
policies  or  procedures  of the FT  Funds,  the FT Funds'  advisers,  principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or  activities  of the Covered  Officers who are subject to this Code,  they are
superseded  by this Code to the extent that they  overlap or  conflict  with the
provisions of this Code.  The FT Code of Ethics and Policy  Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter  pursuant  to Rule 17j-l under the  Investment  Company Act and more
detailed  policies  and  procedures  set  forth in FT's  Employee  Handbook  are
separate  requirements  applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.



- -------------------------------------

1 Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal
executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party. If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual report; (2) post the text of the code on its Internet website and
disclose, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3) undertake in
its most recent report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person without charge,
upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which such request
may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to, or waivers (including
implicit waivers) from, a provision of the code in the registrant's annual
report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant intends to satisfy the
requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting such information on
its website, it will be required to disclose its Internet address and this
intention.

2 Reporting of these affiliations or other  relationships may be made separately
by completing  the Directors  and Officers  Questionnaire  and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel.

3 Any  activity  or  relationship  that would  present a conflict  for a Covered
Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member
of the Covered  Officer's  immediate  family  engages in such an activity or has
such a  relationship.  The Cover Person should also obtain  written  approval by
FT's General Counsel in such situations.

4 FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult,  as
appropriate,  with members of the Audit  Committee,  counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent  Directors,  and are encouraged to do so.

5 Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines  "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material  departure  from a  provision  of the  code of  ethics"  and  "implicit
waiver,"  which must also be  disclosed,  as "the  registrant's  failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material  departure from a
provision  of the  code of  ethics  that  has been  made  known to an  executive
officer" of the registrant.
