Dear Fellow Shareholder:

As we consider how the financial markets may perform in 2004, we think
it is important to take note of the increasingly positive trends that
have become apparent in the U.S. economy and financial markets. The
stimulus provided by fiscal and monetary policies has drawn the economy
out of the slump of early 2003 and rising profits prompted a broad rally
for stocks. In the bond market, a favorable trend of declining interest
rates over the past six months has given way to the possibility of
Federal Reserve tightening some time this year. We see indications that
these trends will take shape in the remainder of the year and know that
Putnam management teams will seek to position the funds to benefit from
them.

Putnam Premier Income Trust's strong six-month performance reflects
favorable economic and market conditions for the global fixed-income
markets that helped bring interest rates down over the course of the
period. Despite surging stock market returns in both the United States
and Europe, the period was also a positive one for bonds, as low
inflation and improved economic conditions helped bolster prices --
especially for bonds with lower credit quality. In the following pages,
your fund's management team discusses fund performance, market trends,
investment strategies, and sector performance that contributed to
returns. The management team also discusses its expectations for the
months ahead.

We deeply appreciate your continued confidence in Putnam and we are
committed to helping you pursue your long-term investment goals. We
firmly believe that your patience will be rewarded.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                  George Putnam, III

Report from Fund Management

Fund highlights

 * During the semiannual period ended January 31, 2004, Putnam Premier
   Income Trust had a total return at net asset value (NAV) of 10.89%. The
   fund's return at market price was 10.25%.

 * Due to its emphasis on high-yield bonds and investments in
   emerging-market securities, as well as a beneficial currency strategy,
   the fund significantly outperformed the 3.88% return of its primary
   benchmark, the Lehman Government Bond Index.

 * Also as a result of its investments in high-yield bonds, and, to a
   lesser extent, emerging-market securities, the fund slightly
   outperformed (at NAV) the 10.80% average return of funds in the Lipper
   Flexible Income Funds (Closed-End) category.

 * The fund's return at market price was consistent, although slightly
   lower, than its return at NAV, reflecting investors' positive
   perceptions of the fund's investment strategy and the global bond
   markets generally.

 * See the Performance Summary beginning on page 7 for complete fund
   performance, comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

During the first half of its fiscal year, Putnam Premier Income Trust
benefited from an unusually positive confluence of factors that drove
solid returns in the global bond markets and strong returns in the
equity markets. The U.S. economy steamed forward, with robust growth of
8.2% in the third 2003 calendar quarter, and solid, albeit somewhat
slower, growth in the fourth calendar quarter. However, with high
productivity, an accommodative Federal Reserve Board monetary policy,
and no apparent threat of inflation in either the United States or
Europe, bond yields -- fluctuating within a broad range -- generally
declined over the six-month period. This helped bolster returns (since
bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields). In this
environment, bonds with lower credit quality generally outperformed
higher-quality bonds. As a result, your fund slightly outperformed its
benchmark index and Lipper category average, primarily due to its focus
on high-yield bonds and, to a lesser extent, emerging-market bonds.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Premier Income Trust is designed for investors seeking a high
level of current income. The fund maintains flexibility across three
sectors -- U.S. government and agencies, high-yield corporate, and
international -- to seek maximum current income without undue risk to
capital. The fund may be appropriate for investors seeking a higher
level of income who can accept a moderately higher level of risk.


Market overview

Overall, global bond markets performed well for the six-month period,
despite a dramatic upturn in interest rates during June and July 2003.
This rise in yields was caused by a change in perceptions about the
state of the U.S. economic recovery and the level of risk investors were
willing to accept. As investors grew more optimistic about the economy,
they became more comfortable with higher levels of risk and therefore
less enamored with high-quality bonds such as U.S. Treasuries.

From August 2003 through January 2004, the global bond markets continued
to be volatile, with yields rising and falling within a fairly broad
range with each bit of news that either challenged or supported the
notion of a sustained economic recovery. However, low inflation and an
accommodative Fed monetary policy helped bond yields in the United
States to trend generally downward. In Europe, low inflation reduced the
likelihood of a rate increase by the European Central Bank, and European
government agency bonds turned in a solid performance. In emerging
markets, the strengthening global economy helped boost commodities
exports, helping performance in both the stock and bond markets of these
countries. The U.S. dollar continued to weaken, as the country's trade
deficit ballooned, causing concerns about the ability of foreign
investors to continue supporting the trade gap (foreign direct
investment in the United States essentially finances the trade deficit).

U.S. high-yield corporate bonds remained strong, continuing this
sector's most impressive year of returns since the early 1990s. Default
rates continued to decline, and credit quality improved as companies
retired or refinanced debt. Responding to the strong performance,
investor demand for high-yield bonds was heavy, and there was ample new
issuance.

Strategy overview

One of our main strategies during the past six months was to emphasize
investments in four dollar-bloc countries (countries whose currencies
are tied to the U.S. dollar) -- Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia,
and New Zealand. As the global economy began to show signs of growth
during the summer of 2003 and these four economies began to strengthen,
the central banks of these countries either hinted at raising interest
rates or, in the case of Canada and the United Kingdom, actually raised
them (twice in Canada and once in the U.K.). We felt the concerns about
rapid growth were overblown, and increased the fund's weightings in
government agency bonds in all four countries. Over the course of the
semiannual period, interest rates in these countries either leveled off
or declined, providing a boost to the performance of the fund's
holdings. In New Zealand, there has been talk of a rate cut, and
Canada's central bank cut interest rates three times in a row. Although
the U.K. raised rates early in the period, the yield curve appears to
have factored in many more rate hikes than we think are likely. Toward
the end of the period, we reduced the weightings in Canada, Australia,
and New Zealand after the fund's holdings from these countries had shown
strong performance.

We continued to overweight U.S. high-yield corporate bonds during the
period, which made a positive contribution to the fund's returns. This
sector remains the fund's largest single weighting, and high-yield bonds
performed well due to the strong economy, improving credit quality,
declining default rates, and a favorable supply/demand environment.
Within the U.S. investment-grade sector, we maintained the fund's
weighting in mortgage-backed securities, which had solid, albeit
unspectacular performance, after being hurt by heavy home mortgage
refinancing activity during the spring and summer of 2003.

How fund holdings affected performance

The primary trend characterizing the past six months was that securities
- -- of all types, both debt and equity -- with greater credit risk
significantly outperformed those with higher quality and lower risk,
reflecting a new attitude among investors that had not been seen for
most of the three and a half years preceding this semiannual period. In
the bond markets, securities with lower credit quality outperformed
Treasuries in each of the six months from August 2003 through January
2004. As a result, the fund's holdings of U.S. high-yield corporate
bonds, its largest weighting, made a significant contribution to
performance. Within this sector, we sought, on a selective basis,
opportunities in lower-quality bonds that offered both higher yields and
the potential for an improvement in credit quality. Our primary
rationale was that, in an environment of economic recovery and declining
corporate default rates, we believed these securities offered the
greatest total return potential within the high-yield universe. As the
economy and stock market improved during the period, many high-yield
bonds -- especially those with lower ratings and higher yields -- had
impressive price gains in addition to their attractive yields. To take
advantage of this trend, we generally underweighted BB-rated bonds and
overweighted those with CCC ratings. We also sought bonds issued by
companies with adequate liquidity and a strong ability to meet their
obligations. Bonds with CCC ratings were among the best-performing bonds
in the high-yield market during the period.

Although the fund's emerging markets weighting was neutral, relative to
many competitors, this sector contributed strongly to returns. As
mentioned, these securities have surged as a result of strong growth in
many emerging-market countries, including Brazil, Mexico, India, China,
and South Korea. This growth has been due in large part to gains in
manufacturing and exports to other rapidly growing countries. As a
result of what we believed were excessive valuations near the end of the
period, we sharply reduced the fund's exposure to emerging-market
securities by the period's end.

European government agency bonds continued to produce solid returns,
helped by the rising euro in relation to the continuing decline in the
U.S. dollar. Stable or declining interest rates and economic growth in
most Continental countries contributed to this sector's performance.

Mortgage-backed securities performed well, although their performance
lagged many sectors of lower credit quality because of investors'
preference for the latter. Nevertheless, after a difficult summer of
volatility caused by high prepayment levels, these securities earned
their coupon rates and had relatively stable principal values. We
deployed the fund's assets in this sector as an anchor against some of
the more volatile sectors with higher credit risk.

Finally, the fund's currency strategy continued to favor a weakening
dollar and a rising euro, and made a solid contribution to returns.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in  accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary
in the future.

The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

The global economy is currently in a state of transition, making it
difficult to assess what could happen in the coming months. There has
been tremendous stimulus in the United States in the form of tax cuts, a
weaker dollar, increased government spending -- some related to the Iraq
war -- and interest rates that have been at historical lows for some
time. Meanwhile, there have been few clear signs from central banks that
significant tightening will occur in 2004. The increased willingness
among investors to accept risk has helped boost the capital markets,
which has also provided economic stimulus. Overseas, interest rates are
somewhat higher, but are stable and, in some cases, have been reduced.
Surging growth in Asia and the U.S. economic recovery have provided the
fabled "rising tide that lifts all boats," helping many smaller
countries around the world to grow their economies.

Countering these forces are several trends that may hold back growth
from a pace that we would normally see in a cyclical recovery from
recession. These trends include the ongoing efforts among corporations
to reduce debt, which diverts resources from capital spending, as well
as continued high productivity, which enables companies to produce more
with the same resources. Finally, low wages in developing regions, such
as Asia, are holding down global wages overall. As a result, many
developed economies, especially the United States, have experienced a
"jobless recovery."

While we suspect the Federal Reserve Board may raise rates sometime this
year, it is by no means a certainty. Should the Fed begin to tighten, it
will likely do so in a careful, deliberate, and open manner, with
significant warning to investors beforehand. As a result, we have
positioned the fund to be slightly less sensitive to interest-rate
changes, which we believe is a prudent strategy at this time.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. International
investing involves certain risks, such as currency fluctuations,
economic instability, and political developments. Lower-rated bonds may
offer higher yields in return for more risk. Mutual funds that invest in
government securities are not guaranteed. Mortgage-backed securities are
subject to prepayment risk.

Notes to financial statements
January 31, 2004 (Unaudited)

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Premier Income Trust (the "fund"), is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company. The fund's investment
objective is to seek high current income which it intends to achieve by
allocating its investments among the U.S. government sector, the high
yield sector and the international sector of the fixed-income securities
market. The fund invests in higher yielding, lower rated bonds that have
a higher rate of default due to the nature of the investments.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Investments for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at the last reported sales price on their
principal exchange, or official closing price for certain markets. If no
sales are reported -- as in the case of some securities traded
over-the-counter -- a security is valued at its last reported bid price.
Market quotations are not considered to be readily available for certain
debt obligations; such investments are valued at fair value on the basis
of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service or dealers,
approved by the Trustees. Such services or dealers determine valuations
for normal institutional-size trading units of such securities using
methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and
various relationships, generally recognized by institutional traders,
between securities. Many securities markets and exchanges outside the
U.S. close prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange and
therefore, the closing prices for securities in such markets or on such
exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur after such close but
before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, on certain
days, the fund will fair value foreign securities taking into account
multiple factors, including movements in the U.S. Securities market. The
number of days on which fair value prices will be used will depend on
market activity and it is possible that fair value prices will be used
by the fund to a significant extent. Securities quoted in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange
rate. Short-term investments having remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Other
investments, including restricted securities, are valued at fair value
following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and
procedures are reviewed periodically by the Trustees.

B) Joint trading account The fund may transfer uninvested cash balances,
including cash  collateral received under security lending arrangements,
into a joint trading account along with the cash of other registered
investment companies and certain other accounts managed by Putnam
Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam Management"), the fund's manager, an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. These balances may be
invested in issuers of high-grade short-term investments having
maturities of up to 397 days for collateral received under security
lending arrangements and up to 90 days for other cash investments.

C) Repurchase agreements The fund, or any joint trading account, through
its custodian, receives delivery of the underlying securities, the
market value of which at the time of purchase is required to be in an
amount at least equal to the resale price, including accrued interest.
Collateral for certain tri-party repurchase agreements is held at the
counterparty's custodian in a segregated account for the benefit of the
fund and the counterparty. Putnam Management is responsible for
determining that the value of these underlying securities is at all
times at least equal to the resale price, including accrued interest.

D) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income is
recognized on the ex-dividend date except that certain dividends from
foreign securities are recognized as soon as the fund is informed of the
ex-dividend date. Non-cash dividends, if any, are recorded at the fair
market value of the securities received.

All premiums/discounts are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity
basis.

E) Foreign currency translation The accounting records of the fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. The market value of foreign securities,
currency holdings, and other assets and liabilities are recorded in the
books and records of the fund after translation to U.S. dollars based on
the exchange rates on that day. The cost of each security is determined
using historical exchange rates. Income and withholding taxes are
translated at prevailing exchange rates when earned or incurred. The
fund does not isolate that portion of realized or unrealized gains or
losses resulting from changes in the foreign exchange rate on
investments from fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices
of the securities. Such gains and losses are included with the net
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments. Net realized gains
and losses on foreign currency transactions represent net realized
exchange gains or losses on closed forward currency contracts,
disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized
between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions and
the difference between the amount of investment income and foreign
withholding taxes recorded on the fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation of assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies arise from changes in the value of open forward currency
contracts and assets and liabilities other than investments at the
period end, resulting from changes in the exchange rate. Investments in
foreign securities involve certain risks, including those related to
economic instability, unfavorable political developments, and currency
fluctuations, not present with domestic investments.

F) Forward currency contracts The fund may buy and sell forward currency
contracts, which are agreements between two parties to buy and sell
currencies at a set price on a future date. These contracts are used to
protect against a decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar of the
currencies in which its portfolio securities are denominated or quoted
(or an increase in the value of a currency in which securities a fund
intends to buy are denominated, when a fund holds cash reserves and
short term investments). The U.S. dollar value of forward currency
contracts is determined using current forward currency exchange rates
supplied by a quotation service. The market value of the contract will
fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. The contract is
marked to market daily and the change in market value is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss. When the contract is closed, the fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. The fund could be exposed to risk if the value of the currency
changes unfavorably, if the counterparties to the contracts are unable
to meet the terms of their contracts or if the fund is unable to enter
into a closing position. Forward currency contracts outstanding at
period end, if any, are listed after the fund's portfolio.

G) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund
owns or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on
securities it owns or in which it may invest to increase its current
returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures
and options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the
hedged instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the
value of the underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary
market for the contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is
unable to perform. When the contract is closed, the fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. Realized gains and losses on purchased options are included in
realized gains and losses on investment securities.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in
the value of the futures contract. Such receipts or payments are known
as "variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last
sale price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for
purchased options and the last ask price for written options. Options
traded over-the-counter are valued using prices supplied by dealers.
Futures and written option contracts outstanding at period end, if any,
are listed after the fund's portfolio.

H) Interest rate swap contracts The fund may enter into interest rate
swap contracts, which are arrangements between two parties to exchange
cash flows based on a notional principal amount, to manage the fund's
exposure to interest rates. Interest rate swap contracts are marked to
market daily based upon quotations from market makers and the change, if
any, is recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments made or received
are recorded as realized gain or loss. The fund could be exposed to
credit or market risk due to unfavorable changes in the fluctuation of
interest rates or if the counterparty defaults on its obligation to
perform. Interest rate swap contracts outstanding at period end, if any,
are listed after the fund's portfolio.

I) Credit default contracts The fund may enter into credit default
contracts where one party, the protection buyer, makes an upfront
payment to a counter party, the protection seller, in exchange for the
right to receive a contingent payment. The maximum amount of the payment
may equal the notional amount, at par, of the underlying index or
security as a result of a related credit event. An upfront payment
received by the fund, as the protection seller, is recorded as a
liability on the fund's books. An upfront payment made by the fund, as
the protection buyer, is recorded as an asset on the fund's books. The
credit default contracts are marked to market daily based upon
quotations from market makers and the change, if any, is recorded as
unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made as a result of a
credit event or termination of the contract are recognized, net of a
proportional amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses.
In addition to bearing the risk that the credit event will occur, the
fund could be exposed to market risk due to unfavorable changes in
interest rates or in the price of the underlying security or index, the
possibility that the fund may be unable to close out its position at the
same time or at the same price as if it had purchased comparable
publicly traded securities or that the counterparty may default on its
obligation to perform. The risk of loss may exceed the fair value of
these contracts recognized on the statement of assets and liabilities.
Credit default contracts outstanding at period end, if any, are listed
after the fund's portfolio.

J) TBA purchase commitments The fund may enter into "TBA" (to be
announced) commitments to purchase securities for a fixed unit price at
a future date beyond customary settlement time. Although the unit price
has been established, the principal value has not been finalized.
However, the amount of the commitments will not significantly differ
from the principal amount. The fund holds, and maintains until
settlement date, cash or high-grade debt obligations in an amount
sufficient to meet the purchase price, or the fund may enter into
offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other securities it owns.
Income on the securities will not be earned until settlement date. TBA
purchase commitments may be considered securities themselves, and
involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased
declines prior to the settlement date, which risk is in addition to the
risk of decline in the value of the fund's other assets. Unsettled TBA
purchase commitments are valued at the fair value of the underlying
securities, according to the procedures described under "Security
valuation" above.

Although the fund will generally enter into TBA purchase commitments
with the intention of acquiring securities for its portfolio or for
delivery pursuant to options contracts it has entered into, the fund may
dispose of a commitment prior to settlement if Putnam Management deems
it appropriate to do so.

K) TBA sale commitments The fund may enter into TBA sale commitments to
hedge its portfolio positions or to sell mortgage-backed securities it
owns under delayed delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA sale
commitments are not received until the contractual settlement date.
During the time a TBA sale commitment is outstanding, equivalent
deliverable securities, or an offsetting TBA purchase commitment
deliverable on or before the sale commitment date, are held as "cover"
for the transaction.

Unsettled TBA sale commitments are valued at the fair value of the
underlying securities, generally according to the procedures described
under "Se cur ity valuation" above. The contract is "marked-to-market"
daily and the change in market value is recorded by the fund as an
unrealized gain or loss. If the TBA sale commitment is closed through
the acquisition of an offsetting purchase commitment, the fund realizes
a gain or loss. If the fund delivers securities under the commitment,
the fund realizes a gain or a loss from the sale of the securities based
upon the unit price established at the date the commitment was entered
into. TBA sale commitments outstanding at period end, if any, are listed
after the fund's portfolio.

L) Security lending The fund may lend securities, through its agents, to
qualified borrowers in order to earn additional income. The loans are
collateralized by cash and/or securities in an amount at least equal to
the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of
securities loaned is determined daily and any additional required
collateral is allocated to the fund on the next business day.

The risk of borrower default will be borne by the fund's agents; the
fund will bear the risk of loss with respect to the investment of the
cash collateral. Income from securities lending is included in
investment income on the Statement of operations. At January 31, 2004,
the value of securities loaned amounted to $1,959,195. The fund received
cash collateral of $1,998,864 which is pooled with collateral of other
Putnam funds into 9 issuers of high grade short-term investments.

M) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
taxable income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund to distribute
an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax under Section
4982 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Therefore, no
provision has been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or
unrealized appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income
and capital gains.

At July 31, 2003, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $234,718,499
available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future net capital
gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover   Expiration
- --------------------------------
  $39,893,260    July 31, 2007
   44,857,570    July 31, 2008
   24,930,247    July 31, 2009
   44,917,486    July 31, 2010
   80,119,936    July 31, 2011

Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to regulated
investment companies, the fund has elected to defer to its fiscal year
ending July 31, 2004 $2,541,873 of losses recognized during the period
November 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003.

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $1,052,218,052,
resulting in gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of
$71,335,144 and $56,791,747 respectively, or net unrealized appreciation
of $14,543,397.

N) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. The amount and character of
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations.


Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee
is based on the following annual rates: 0.75% of the first $500 million
of average weekly net assets, 0.65% of the next $500 million, 0.60% of
the next $500 million and 0.55% thereafter.

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company (PFTC), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor servicing agent
functions to the fund. During the six months ended January 31, 2004, the
fund paid PFTC $442,239 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the six months ended January 31,
2004, the fund's expenses were reduced by $18,841 under these
arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $1,248 has been allocated to the fund, and an additional fee for
each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive additional fees for
attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense
for the fund is included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the
Statement of operations. Accrued pension liability is included in
Payable for Trustee compensation and expenses in the Statement of assets
and liabilities.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended January 31, 2004, cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities other than U.S. government
securities and short-term investments aggregated $348,872,165 and
$416,542,471, respectively. Purchases and sales of U.S. government
securities aggregated $51,320,792 and $14,861,379, respectively.

Note 4
Regulatory matters and litigation

On November 13, 2003, Putnam Management agreed to entry of an order by
the Securities and Exchange Commission in partial resolution of
administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings initiated by the SEC on
October 28, 2003 in connection with alleged excessive short-term trading
by at least six Putnam Management investment professionals. The SEC's
findings reflect that four of those employees engaged in such trading in
funds over which they had investment decision-making responsibility and
had access to non-public information regarding, among other things,
current portfolio holdings and valuations. The six individuals are no
longer employed by Putnam Management. Under the order, Putnam Management
will make restitution for losses attributable to excessive short-term
trading by Putnam employees, institute new employee trading restrictions
and enhanced employee trading compliance, retain an independent
compliance consultant, and take other remedial actions. Putnam
Management neither admitted nor denied the order's findings, which
included findings that Putnam Management  willfully violated provisions
of the federal securities laws. A civil monetary penalty and other
monetary relief, if any, will be determined at a later date. If a
hearing is necessary to determine the amounts of such penalty or other
relief, Putnam Management will be precluded from arguing that it did not
violate the federal securities laws in the manner described in the SEC
order, the findings set forth in the SEC order will be accepted as true
by the hearing officer and additional evidence may be presented. Putnam
Management, and not the investors in any Putnam fund, will bear all
costs, including restitution, civil penalties and associated legal fees.
Administrative proceedings instituted by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts on October 28, 2003 against Putnam Management in
connection with alleged market timing activities by Putnam employees and
by participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans are pending.
Putnam Management has committed to make complete restitution for any
losses suffered by Putnam shareholders as a result of any improper
market-timing activities by Putnam employees or within
Putnam-administered 401(k) plans.

The SEC's and Commonwealth's allegations and related matters also serve
as the general basis for numerous lawsuits, including purported class
action lawsuits filed against Putnam Management and certain related
parties, including certain Putnam funds. Putnam Management has agreed to
bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in connection with these
lawsuits. Based on currently available information, Putnam Management
believes that the likelihood that the pending private lawsuits and
purported class action lawsuits will have a material adverse financial
impact on the fund is remote, and the pending actions are not likely to
materially affect its ability to provide investment management services
to its clients, including the Putnam funds.

Review of these matters by counsel for Putnam Management and by separate
independent counsel for the Putnam funds and their  independent Trustees
is continuing. In addition, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Putnam
Management's parent company, has engaged counsel to conduct a separate
review of Putnam Management's policies and controls related to
short-term trading.

Item 9. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders:

        Not applicable

Item 10. Controls and Procedures:
- ---------------------------------

(a) The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded, based on their evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the registrant's
disclosure controls and procedures as of a date within 90 days of
the filing date of this report on Form N-CSR, that the design and
operation of such procedures are generally effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by
the investment company in the reports that it files or submits under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Commission's rules and forms.

Although such officers reached the conclusion expressed in the
preceding paragraph, they are aware of matters that raise concerns
with respect to controls, each of which arose in connection with the
administration of 401(k) plans by Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company.
The first matter, which occurred in early 2001, involved the willful
circumvention of controls by certain Putnam employees in connection
with the correction of operational errors with respect to a 401(k)
client's investment in certain Putnam Funds, which led to losses in
five Putnam Funds (not including the registrant). Such officers
became aware of this matter in February 2004. The second matter,
which occurred in 2002, involved the willful circumvention by
certain Putnam employees of policies and procedures in connection
with the payment of Putnam corporate expenses. Such officers did
not learn that this matter involved a Putnam Fund until January
2004. Putnam has made restitution to the affected Funds,
implemented a number of personnel changes, including senior
personnel, begun to implement changes in procedures to address these
items and informed the SEC, the Funds' Trustees and independent
auditors. An internal investigation and review of procedures and
controls are currently ongoing.

In reaching the conclusion expressed herein, the registrant's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer
considered a number of factors, including the nature of the matters
described above, when the matters occurred, the individuals
involved, personnel changes that have occurred since these matters
occurred, the results to date of the current ongoing investigation
and the overall quality of controls at Putnam at this time.
