ITEM 1.    REPORTS TO STOCKHOLDERS.

           The Semi-Annual Report to Stockholders follows.

<PAGE>

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

   Performance Review: We are pleased to report that during the second quarter
of 2003 your Fund had a total return (market price change plus income) of
11.6%, boosting year-to-date total return to 14.2%. In comparison, the S&P
Utilities Index had a total return of 21.3% for the quarter and 17.5%
year-to-date. A composite of the S&P Utilities Index and the Lehman Utility
Bond Index, reflecting the stock and bond ratio of the Fund, had a total return
of 16.6% for the second quarter and 15.6% year-to-date.

   During the second quarter of 2003, your Fund paid three monthly 6.5 cent
dividends. The 6.5 cent per share monthly rate, without compounding, would be
78 cents annualized, or a 7.18% common stock dividend yield based on the June
30, 2003 closing price of $10.87 per share. That yield compares favorably with
the quarter-end yields of 4.10% on the Dow Jones Utility Index and 4.16% on the
S&P Utilities Index.

   The stock markets are off to a good start this year. The broad market and
the utility sector have advanced strongly, especially in the second quarter.
Within the utility sector, the stocks of highly leveraged and volatile
companies have performed best, while the stocks of more financially strong and
stable companies have lagged. Your Fund, in keeping with its primary investment
objectives of current income and long-term growth of income, maintains a
portfolio that is less aggressive than the hypothetical portfolio reflected in
the utility indexes. As a result, our year-to-date total return has lagged the
utility indexes to some extent. However, it is worth remembering that during
2002, when aggressive portfolios were faring more poorly, your Fund
outperformed the S&P Utilities Index by approximately 27%.

   Tax Law Change: At the end of May, President Bush signed into law the Jobs
and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, lowering the income tax rates
on qualifying dividends and long-term capital gains to 15% for the top four
income tax brackets and to 5% for those in the 10% and 15% tax brackets. The
definition of qualifying dividends is still being clarified but, in general and
subject to a holding period requirement, stock dividends of U.S. corporations
and foreign corporations listed on U.S. exchanges qualify for the reduced tax
rate, with the exception of certain types of preferred stock and REITs. Mutual
funds will generally be able to pass through to their shareholders the same tax
treatment of qualifying dividends and long-term capital gains that would be
applicable to the funds themselves. However, your Fund's dividend stream
includes significant income from bonds, preferred stocks, and REITs, which may
not qualify for the reduced tax rate. The exact impact of the tax law change on
your Fund's dividend tax treatment depends on the assets held by the Fund
during the year and will not be known until January 2004 when the Fund issues
an IRS Form 1099 to each of its shareholders.

   The Economic Outlook Has Brightened: The lower taxation of qualifying
dividends is just one aspect of the tax law changes. The tax reductions also
provide marriage penalty relief, an increase in the child tax credit, reduction
in some individual tax rates, and incentives for investment. While fairness in
tax structure was central to the debate, President Bush based his case for the
tax cuts on the need for fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth. The tax law
changes are the Administration's and Congress' response to a period of subdued
economic growth, stubbornly high unemployment and low job creation, and
moderate disinflation (a decline in the rate of inflation).

   The Federal Reserve Board has also responded to the sub-par economic
environment by lowering the federal funds rate thirteen times since December
2000, most recently in June of this year, to levels not seen for 45 years.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said in his recent semiannual testimony
to the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee that the Fed
intends to keep rates low for as long as needed to promote satisfactory
economic performance.

<PAGE>

   Because of the recent volatility in economic indicators, it is not clear
what would constitute satisfactory economic performance in the eyes of the Fed.
Over the last six quarters, the Fed has seen a quarter of 5.0% real growth
(first quarter 2002) only to be followed by a quarter of 1.3% growth, then a
quarter of 4.0% growth (third quarter 2002) followed by two quarters of below
1.5% growth, and most recently a 2.4% quarterly growth rate (second quarter
2003). It is possible that the Fed will wait to see two consecutive quarters of
strong growth before changing its accommodative policy.

   It is widely anticipated that the combination of low interest rates and the
recently passed tax legislation will provide a lift to the economy. It has been
estimated that the tax changes will increase household cash flow by $35
billion, prompting a pickup in consumer spending. More importantly, it is hoped
that lower tax rates will enable businesses to become more productive--creating
jobs and increasing workers' incomes. In addition, low interest rates will
continue to encourage home refinancing, which gives homeowners an opportunity
to extract cash and/or lower their monthly payments. The resulting increase in
consumer liquidity is expected to boost consumer confidence, and continue to
benefit corporations by enabling them to borrow at lower interest rates and
with less risk premium.

   It thus appears that the economic factors are in place for improved consumer
and business activity. If the economy improves, it is likely that the stock
markets will improve, and that the virtuous cycle of compounding gains will be
reestablished.

   Back to Basics for the Electric and Natural Gas Groups: The first half of
2003 has been relatively uneventful for the utility sector compared to the
prior fifteen months. The latter part of 2001 and most of 2002 were a
tumultuous period for the utility sector, which was buffeted by a series of
developments inconsistent with the sector's reputation as safe and stable. A
confluence of events, including a dysfunctional California power market and
high natural gas prices, forced energy prices higher, while at the end of the
period a slow economy, an oversupply of generating capacity, and a contraction
in energy trading kept energy prices below break-even for many generating
facilities.

   As a result, we have witnessed the bankruptcy, or near-bankruptcy, not only
of several of the more aggressive energy merchants, but also of a number of
traditional utilities. The rating agencies, due to heightened concerns about
the utility industry following the "Enron Debacle", have sharply increased
their scrutiny of utility companies. Many formerly high quality companies have
experienced credit downgrades, some to well below investment grade resulting in
a sharply higher corporate cost of capital, capital expenditure curtailment,
dividend reductions or eliminations, and liquidity crises. Unethical energy
trading practices, faulty electric and gas price reporting, and questionable
accounting practices have further tarnished the industry's reputation.

   As 2002 progressed, management turnover proliferated, and replacement
management turned away from risky, high-growth endeavors and turned back to
basics--the core businesses of providing electricity and natural gas in the
most efficient manner possible. International business units, which served
mostly as capital drains and distractions for management, were closed or
divested. In addition, energy trading businesses not backed by physical assets
were abandoned or wound down. Companies shored up stressed balance sheets by
issuing new equity and selling "non-core" assets to reduce debt. Thus far in
2003, further progress has been made along these lines by most of the troubled
companies in the sector. Balance sheets appear to be healthier, and there
continue to be improvements in debt-to-capital ratios, as well as companies'
ability to service interest costs. We view 2003 as a transition year, with
continued progress towards restored financial health.

   Investors have also embraced the back to basics concept, and many utility
stock values have been helped by the sector's return to favor. Gone are
expectations and pressure on utility managements to far exceed a low- to
mid-single

                                      2

digit earnings growth rate. Investors now recognize that higher growth
rates--if achievable at all--require traditional regulated utility managements
to engage in risky, highly uncertain strategies with which they are mostly
unfamiliar. Investors have realized the value in the steady stream of cash
flows that come from a utility's core distribution business and the natural
hedge against risk of owned, rather than contracted or purchased, power
generation. Cash flows underpin a company's ability to fund capital
expenditures as well as dividends and, therefore, are an accurate and
meaningful sign of the operating and financial health of a utility.

   Fortunately, DNP's strategy has emphasized just these types of
companies--stable and regulated distribution businesses with secure dividend
streams. We intend to continue with this investment strategy in the future.

   Board of Director's Meeting: At the July Board of Directors' meeting, the
Board declared the following monthly dividends:

   Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan and Direct Deposit Service--The Fund
has a dividend reinvestment plan available as a benefit to all registered
shareholders. As long as the market price of the common stock of the Fund
exceeds or is equal to the net asset value per share, new shares for the
dividend reinvestment program are issued at the greater of either 95% of the
market price or net asset value. If the market price per share of common stock
is below the net asset value per share, shares are purchased in the open market
at prevailing market prices, plus any brokerage commissions paid by The Bank of
New York.

   Those shareholders whose shares are held for them by a brokerage house or
nominee in "street-name" may not participate in the Fund's automatic dividend
reinvestment plan. For such shareholders desiring automatic dividend
reinvestment, we suggest you contact your broker or other nominee.

   As an added service, without cost to the shareholder, the Fund offers direct
deposit service through electronic funds transfer to all registered
shareholders currently receiving a monthly dividend check. This service is
offered through The Bank of New York. For more information and/or an
authorization form on automatic dividend reinvestment or direct deposit, please
contact The Bank of New York (1-877-381-2537 or http://stock.bankofny.com).

   We appreciate your interest in DNP Select Income Fund Inc., and we will
continue to do our best to be of service to you.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (UNAUDITED)
                                 June 30, 2003

(1) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

   DNP SELECT INCOME FUND INC. (the "Fund", formerly Duff & Phelps Utilities
Income Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland on
November 26, 1986. The Fund commenced operations on January 21, 1987, as a
closed-end diversified management investment company registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The primary investment objectives of the Fund
are current income and long-term growth of income. Capital appreciation is a
secondary objective.

   The following are the significant accounting policies of the Fund:

      (a) The market values for securities are determined as follows: Equity
   securities traded on a national securities exchange or traded
   over-the-counter and quoted on the NASDAQ System are valued at last sales
   prices. Fixed income securities and any other securities for which it is
   determined that market prices are unavailable or inappropriate are valued at
   a fair value using a procedure determined in good faith by the Board of
   Directors which includes the use of a pricing service. Each money market
   instrument having a maturity of 60 days or less is valued on an amortized
   cost basis, which approximates market value.

      (b) No provision is made for Federal income taxes since the Fund has
   elected to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" and has made such
   distributions to its shareholders deemed necessary to be relieved of all
   Federal income taxes under provisions of current Federal tax law. The Fund
   intends to utilize provisions of Federal income tax laws which allow a
   realized capital loss to be carried forward for eight years following the
   year of loss and offset such losses against any future realized gains. At
   December 31, 2002, the Fund had tax capital loss carry forwards of
   $199,205,932 which expire beginning on December 31, 2003. For the period
   November 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002, the Fund incurred net realized
   capital losses of $181,983,140. The Fund intends to treat these losses as
   having occurred on January 1, 2003.

      At December 31, 2002, on a tax basis, the Fund had undistributed net
   investment income of $2,103,117; and based on a $2,792,953,260 tax cost of
   investments, gross unrealized appreciation of $139,857,445 and unrealized
   depreciation of $126,699,675. The difference between the book basis and tax
   basis of distributable earnings are primarily a result of tax deferral of
   wash sale losses, the accretion of market discount and amortization of
   premiums.

      (c) The accounts of the Fund are kept on the accrual basis of accounting.
   Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains or
   losses from sales of securities are determined on the specific identified
   cost basis. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date. Interest
   income and expense are recognized on the accrual basis. Discounts and
   premiums on securities are amortized over the lives of the respective
   securities for book purposes. Discounts and premiums are not amortized for
   tax purposes.

      (d) The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
   principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
   make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
   and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
   date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
   decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual
   results could differ from those estimates.

      (e) As required, effective January 1, 2002, the Fund has adopted the
   classification requirement of EITF D-98, Classification and Measurement of
   Redeemable Securities. EITF D-98 requires that preferred stock be presented
   separately at liquidation preference on the balance sheet. Accordingly,
   certain reclassifications have been made to the statement of operations,
   statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights for all periods
   presented. The adoption of EITF D-98 had no impact on the net asset value of
   the common stock of the Fund.

(2) MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENTS:

   The Fund has engaged Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co. (the "Adviser")
to provide professional investment management services for the Fund and has
engaged J. J. B. Hilliard, W. L. Lyons, Inc. (the "Administrator") to provide
administrative and management services for the Fund. The Adviser receives a
quarterly fee at an annual rate of .60% of the average weekly net assets of the
Fund up to $1.5 billion and .50% of average weekly net assets in excess
thereof. The Administrator receives a quarterly fee at annual rates of .25% of
average weekly net assets up to $100 million, .20% of average weekly net assets
from $100 million to $1 billion, and .10% of average weekly net assets over $1
billion. For purposes of the foregoing calculations, "average weekly net
assets" is defined as the sum of (i) the aggregate net asset value of the
Fund's common stock (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of the Fund's
preferred stock and (iii) the aggregate proceeds to the Fund of commercial
paper issued by the Fund. Directors of the Fund not affiliated with the Adviser
receive a fee of $25,000 per year plus $2,000 per board meeting, plus $1,500
per committee meeting attended. Committee Chairmen receive an additional fee of
$5,000 per year. Total fees paid to directors for the six months ended June 30,
2003 were $247,195. Transfer agent and custodian fees are paid to The Bank of
New York.

(3) DIVIDENDS:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the following distributions to common
stockholders from investment income in 2003:

</TABLE>

   The tax basis for all distributions was ordinary income.

(4) CAPITAL STOCK TRANSACTIONS:

   The Fund may purchase shares of its own stock in open market or private
transactions, from time to time and in such amounts and at such prices (not
exceeding $100,000 plus accumulated and unpaid dividends in the case of the
Fund's remarketed preferred stock and less than net asset value in the case of
the Fund's common stock) as management may deem advisable. Since any such
purchases of the Fund's common stock would be made at prices below net asset
value, they would increase the net asset value per share of the remaining
shares of common stock outstanding. The Fund has not purchased any shares of
its common stock.

   Transactions in common stock and paid-in surplus during 2002 and for the six
months ended June 30, 2003 were as follows:

                                 June 30, 2003


(5) REMARKETED PREFERRED STOCK:

   In 1988, the Fund issued 5,000 shares of Remarketed Preferred Stock ("RP")
in five series of 1,000 shares each at a public offering price of $100,000 per
share. The underwriting discount and other expenses incurred in connection with
the issuance of the RP were recorded as a reduction of paid-in surplus on
common stock. Dividends on the RP are cumulative at a rate which was initially
established for each series at its offering. Since the initial offering of each
series, the dividend rate on each series has been reset every 49 days by a
remarketing process. Dividend rates ranged from 1.05% to 1.43% during the six
months ended June 30, 2003.

   The RP is redeemable at the option of the Fund on any dividend payment date
at a redemption price equal to $100,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
dividends. The Fund is required to maintain certain asset coverage with respect
to the RP, and the RP is subject to mandatory redemption if that asset coverage
is not maintained. Each series of RP is also subject to mandatory redemption on
a date certain as follows: Series A--November 28, 2012; Series B--November 18,
2015; Series C--November 7, 2018; Series D--December 22, 2021; and Series
E--December 11, 2024.

   In general, the holders of the RP and of the Common Stock have equal voting
rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the RP, as a class,
vote to elect two members of the Board of Directors, and separate class votes
are required on certain matters that affect the respective interests of the RP
and the Common Stock. The RP has a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share
plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

(6) COMMERCIAL PAPER:

   The Board of Directors has authorized the Fund to issue up to $200,000,000
of Commercial Paper Notes (the "Notes") in minimum denominations of $100,000
with maturities up to 270 days. The Notes generally will be sold on a discount
basis, but may be sold on an interest-bearing basis. The Notes are not
redeemable by the Fund nor are they subject to voluntary prepayment prior to
maturity. The aggregate amount of Notes outstanding changes from time to time.
The Notes are unsecured, general obligations of the Fund. The Fund has entered
into a credit agreement to provide liquidity. The Fund is able to request loans
under the credit agreement of up to $100,000,000 at any one time, subject to
certain restrictions. Interest rates on the Notes ranged from 1.23% to 1.40%
during the six months ended June 30, 2003. At June 30, 2003, the Fund had Notes
outstanding of $198,755,057.

(7) INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS:

   For the six months ended June 30, 2003, purchases and sales of investment
securities (excluding short-term securities) were $2,843,676,518 and
$2,829,268,803, respectively.

   The Fund may lend portfolio securities to a broker/dealer. Loans are
required to be secured at all times by collateral at least equal to the market

ITEM 9.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

          (a)  Within the 90-day period prior to the filing of this report, the
               registrant's management carried out an evaluation, with the
               participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
               Officer, of the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
               controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the
               Investment Company Act of 1940). Based on their evaluation, the
               Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe that
               the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are effective
               to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
               registrant on Form N-CSR is recorded, processed, summarized and
               reported within the time periods specified in Securities and
               Exchange Commission rules and forms.

          (b)  There have been no changes in the registrant's internal control
               over financial reporting during the registrant's most recent
               fiscal half-year that have materially affected, or are reasonably
               likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control
               over financial reporting.
