                  CAUTION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the goals,
beliefs, plans or current expectations of First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First
Trust" or the "Advisor") and its representatives, taking into account the
information currently available to them. Forward-looking statements include all
statements that do not relate solely to current or historical fact. For example,
forward-looking statements include the use of words such as "anticipate,"
"estimate," "intend," "expect," "believe," "plan," "may," "should," "would" or
other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes.

Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and
other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of
First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") to be materially
different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or
implied by the forward-looking statements. When evaluating the information
included in this report, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these
forward-looking statements, which reflect the judgment of the Advisor and its
representatives only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to
publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events and
circumstances that arise after the date hereof.

                        PERFORMANCE AND RISK DISCLOSURE

There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. The
Fund is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values
of securities owned by the Fund will decline and that the value of the Fund
shares may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can
lose money by investing in the Fund. See "Risk Considerations" in the Additional
Information section of this report for a discussion of certain other risks of
investing in the Fund.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. For the most recent month-end performance figures, please visit
http://www.ftportfolios.com or speak with your financial advisor. Investment
returns, net asset value and common share price will fluctuate and Fund shares,
when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

The Advisor may also periodically provide additional information on Fund
performance on the Fund's webpage at http://www.ftportfolios.com.

                            HOW TO READ THIS REPORT

This report contains information that may help you evaluate your investment in
the Fund. It includes details about the Fund and presents data and analysis that
provide insight into the Fund's performance and investment approach.

By reading the portfolio commentary by the portfolio management team of the
Fund, you may obtain an understanding of how the market environment affected the
Fund's performance. The statistical information that follows may help you
understand the Fund's performance compared to that of a relevant market
benchmark.

It is important to keep in mind that the opinions expressed by personnel of the
Advisor are just that: informed opinions. They should not be considered to be
promises or advice. The opinions, like the statistics, cover the period through
the date on the cover of this report. The material risks of investing in the
Fund are spelled out in the prospectus, the statement of additional information,
this report and other Fund regulatory filings.

SHAREHOLDER LETTER

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                  SEMI-ANNUAL LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CEO
                               NOVEMBER 30, 2016


Dear Shareholders:

Thank you for your investment in First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund
II.

First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust") is pleased to provide you with the
semi-annual report which contains detailed information about your investment for
the six months ended November 30, 2016, including a market overview and a
performance analysis for the period. We encourage you to read this report and
discuss it with your financial advisor.

Early in 2016, many investors were concerned that the volatility witnessed in
the stock market in 2015 would continue, and it did. During the first six months
of the year, one of the events that affected the global markets was the "Brexit"
vote (where citizens in the UK voted to leave the European Union). Just a few
days after the historic vote, the global equity markets rebounded to close June
30, 2016 at a combined market capitalization of $62 trillion. As of November 30,
2016, the S&P 500(R) Index was up 8.49% calendar year-to-date, according to
Bloomberg. The last few months had investors keenly watching the presidential
election in anticipation of the outcome of the vote and its effect on the stock
market and economy.

On November 8, Donald J. Trump was elected to become the 45th president in our
country's history. While no one has a crystal ball and the ability to predict
how his presidency will shape the United States (and the world), there is no
doubt that Trump's populist message resonated for many Americans. Trump's
message of improving lives for the "average" American, while reducing the size
and scope of the federal government, also likely won him millions of votes. Many
of Trump supporters believe that with his background in business, he will make
policy changes that will help grow the economy and continue to spur stock
markets. As with all change and a new administration, only time will tell.

The current bull market (measuring from March 9, 2009 through November 30, 2016)
is the second longest in history. First Trust believes that having a long-term
investment horizon and investing in quality products can help you reach your
goals, regardless of ups and downs in the market. We strive to provide quality
investment products, which has been one of the hallmarks of our firm since its
inception more than 25 years ago.

Thank you for giving First Trust the opportunity to be a part of your investment
plan. We value our relationship with you and will continue to focus on helping
investors like you reach your financial goals.

Sincerely,

/s/ James A. Bowen

James A. Bowen
Chairman of the Board of Trustees
Chief Executive Officer of First Trust Advisors L.P.

FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II

The primary investment objective of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund
II ("FCT" or the "Fund") is to seek a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The Fund pursues its
objectives by primarily investing in a portfolio of senior secured floating-rate
loan interests ("senior loans"). There can be no assurance that the Fund's
investment objectives will be achieved. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

MARKET RECAP

The last six months were strong for the senior loan and high-yield bond markets,
driven predominantly by the renewed strength in commodity prices. The S&P/LSTA
Leveraged Loan Index (the "Index") generated positive returns for each of the
prior six months and returned 4.22% for the period. The Bank of America Merrill
Lynch US High Yield Constrained Index experienced similar strength with positive
returns for the first five months of the period and a total return of 6.54% in
the period. This compares to the 6.01% for the S&P 500 Index.

From a credit quality perspective, lower credit-rated issues provided the
strongest returns during the period within the senior loan market. Lower quality
CCC-rated issues returned 12.46%, outperforming the 4.49% return for B-rated
issues and the 2.62% return for BB-rated issues. The average price of senior
loans in the market began the period at $93.41, fell modestly to $93.20 after
the first month in the period and then rallied to finish the period at $97.09.

Default Rates

The trailing 12-month default rate within the Index entered the period at 1.96%
and ended the period at a six-month low of 1.66%, which remains well below the
3.12% long-term average for the asset class (March 1999 - November 2016). The
decline in the corporate default rate during the period was largely driven by a
stabilization in commodity prices as defaults in the oil & gas and nonferrous
metals/minerals sectors have slowed. Given the strength of corporate balance
sheets today, the lack of near-term debt maturities, and access to robust
capital markets, we believe default rates within the high-yield bond market may
continue to drift lower in 2017, driven by stabilized commodity prices --
principally oil, gas, coal and iron ore -- while default rates within the senior
loan market should remain relatively stable.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Fund's performance was in line with that of the Index on a net asset value
("NAV") basis for the six-month period ending November 30, 2016. The Fund
generated an NAV return of 4.27% and a market price return of 8.94%, while the
Index returned 4.22%. The Fund's market price return was impacted by the Fund's
discount to NAV tightening over the six-month period. At the start of the
period, the Fund's market price was at a 7.12% discount to NAV, and moved to a
2.96% discount to NAV by the end of the period, a tightening of 416 basis points
("bps"). We believe the tightening is evidence of the fact that investors have
found the asset class relatively attractive.

From an income perspective, the monthly distribution rate was unchanged
throughout the period at $0.07 per share. The annualized distribution rate at
the end of November 2016, assuming a $0.07 per share monthly distribution rate,
was 5.92% at NAV and 6.10% at market price.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                               SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

The largest contributing factor to the Fund's performance relative to the Index
over the period was the Fund's use of leverage. Leverage began the period at
26.76% and ended the period at 30.71%. Contributing positively to returns
relative to the Index in the period was the Fund's selection within the lodging
& casinos industry. Detracting from returns was the Fund's underweight position
within the nonferrous metals/minerals and oil & gas industries within the senior
loan market, which returned 31.20% and 19.26%, respectively, over the past six
months.

MARKET AND FUND OUTLOOK

Looking ahead to 2017, we believe the surprise election of Donald Trump on
November 8, 2016 may lead to higher economic growth and re-inflation if his
administration can successfully implement policies designed to provide fiscal
stimulus. Specifically, President-Elect Trump outlined lowering individual and
corporate tax rates, increasing infrastructure spending, reducing the regulatory
burden on businesses, and repatriation of cash held overseas by multinational
corporations. We believe the market is not fully pricing in the potential for
higher inflation in the U.S. due to these potential changes. Commodity inflation
remains relatively benign and, unless global central bank activity shifts to a
tightening posture (reduced quantitative easing), we believe that even improving
wage inflation will not cause the Federal Reserve (the "Fed") to move towards a
more aggressive pace of rate increases. However, we will continue to monitor
inflation closely due to the potential impact on the yield curve, which had
flattened significantly in 2016 up until the Presidential election and has since
widened to the point where the yield curve is now roughly unchanged for the
year. The flattening yield curve had been significantly influenced by the Fed
slowly increasing rates, coupled with foreign demand for U.S. bonds tamping down
long term interest rates. However, since the election, it is our view that the
potential for higher growth has already steepened the yield curve.

After several years of senior loan outflows, retail investors have finally begun
to find favor with the senior loan asset class. According to JP Morgan, the
senior loan asset class ended the period with five consecutive monthly inflows
totaling $6.6 billion. The senior loan asset class has not experienced a string
of inflows like this since it saw $80.9 billion of inflows over a stretch of 21
consecutive months between July 2012 and March 2014. Retail flows into the asset
class for the year-to-date period now sit at +$0.2 billion, compared to -$21.7
billion in 2015 and -$23.8 billion in 2014. We believe there are several factors
that contributed to the positive inflow trend. First, LIBOR has been increasing
and has climbed from 61 bps as of December 31, 2015 to 93 bps as of November 30,
2016. For reference, LIBOR was a mere 42 bps as of November 30, 2015. We believe
the increase in LIBOR has increased the attractiveness of senior loans,
especially when compared to longer duration, high interest rate risk bonds.
Moreover, we believe that with the potential for additional interest rate hikes
on the horizon, LIBOR should continue to migrate higher. Additionally, current
senior loan spreads compare favorably to the pre-credit crisis average spread of
L+372 (December 1997 - June 2007) and remain in-line with the long-term average
spread of L+526 (December 1997 - November 2016). We believe senior loans, given
their senior secured position in the capital structure, floating interest rate,
attractive income and low default rate are well positioned as we move into 2017.

We believe that in the near term, volatility may be elevated due to the
potential for significant changes in fiscal policies that may stimulate economic
growth and lead to higher inflation. At this point in the economic cycle,
however, we believe it will likely be short lived. As a result, we believe
near-term volatility should provide compelling opportunities in the U.S.
high-yield bond and senior loan markets and, specifically within actively
managed strategies where opportunities can be taken advantage of and risk can be
appropriately managed. We believe credit selection will be paramount to driving
strong returns over the remainder of this economic cycle. In the early years of
the economic recovery, returns came relatively easily. We believe returns can
still be healthy for this portion of the cycle, however, they will be harder to
come by, with greater volatility in the markets. In a market where equity
volatility is high, we believe investors may benefit from moving up the
corporate capital structure into high-yield bonds and senior loans, where
competitive yields and lower volatility are typical. As we evaluate new
investment opportunities, decisions will continue to be rooted in our rigorous
bottom-up credit analysis and focus on the opportunities that we believe offer
the best risk and reward balance. Despite the many distractions that ebb and
flow every quarter, we remain firmly focused on finding value in the high-yield
bond and senior loan markets.

(a)   All or a portion of the securities are available to serve as collateral on
      the outstanding loan.

(b)   Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests ("Senior Loans") in which the Fund
      invests pay interest at rates which are periodically predetermined by
      reference to a base lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates
      are generally (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European
      banks, such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the
      prime rate offered by one or more United States banks or (iii) the
      certificate of deposit rate. Certain Senior Loans are subject to a LIBOR
      floor that establishes a minimum LIBOR rate. The interest rate shown
      reflects the rate in effect at November 30, 2016. When a range of rates is
      disclosed, the Fund holds more than one contract within the same tranche
      at varying rates.

(c)   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. As a result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may
      be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.

(d)   On October 4, 2016, Arch Coal, Inc. completed a Bankruptcy Plan of
      Reorganization. In connection with the Plan of Reorganization, each lender
      received a portion of a new term loan equal to its closing date term loan
      percentage pursuant to the new credit agreement and a pro rata share of
      the newly issued common equity shares in the new company. The company also
      made a cash distribution to first lien creditors.

(e)   On October 3, 2016, Texas Competitive Electric Holdings ("TCEH") completed
      their reorganization in the form of a tax free spin off from the parent
      company, Energy Future Holdings. As part of the reorganization, first lien
      claim holders received equity in a new entity TCEH Corp., cash held by the
      new entity, tax receivable rights and a beneficial interest in an
      unsecured claim to the parent company, Energy Future Holdings. Effective
      November 7, 2016, TCEH Corp. changed its name to Vistra Energy Corp.

(f)   On December 21, 2015, Millennium Health, LLC completed a Bankruptcy Plan
      of Reorganization. As part of the Bankruptcy Plan of Reorganization, the
      holders of Millennium Laboratories LLC, Tranche B Term Loan received a
      portion of a new term loan and a pro rata share of the newly issued common
      equity shares in New Millennium Holdco, Inc., the new company. Each lender
      was also issued a beneficial interest in the Corporate Claim Trust
      entitling it, as holder of such beneficial interest, to receive Corporate
      Claim Trust Distributions when and if net cash proceeds from the pursuit
      of Retained Corporate Causes of Action are available to make such a
      distribution. In addition, each lender was issued a beneficial interest in
      the Lender Claim Trust entitling it, as holder of such beneficial
      interest, to receive Lender Claim Trust Distributions when and if net cash
      proceeds from the pursuit of Retained Lender Causes of Action are
      available to make such a distribution.

(g)   Pursuant to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, this
      security has been determined to be illiquid by First Trust Advisors L.P.
      (the "Advisor").

(h)   This security, sold within the terms of a private placement memorandum, is
      exempt from registration upon resale under Rule 144A under the Securities
      Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and may be resold in
      transactions exempt from registration, normally to qualified institutional
      buyers. Pursuant to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
      this security has been determined to be liquid by the Advisor. Although
      market instability can result in periods of increased overall market
      illiquidity, liquidity for each security is determined based on
      security-specific factors and assumptions, which require subjective
      judgment. At November 30, 2016, securities noted as such amounted to
      $4,510,150 or 1.2% of net assets.

(i)   Non-income producing security.

(j)   Security received in a transaction exempt from registration under the 1933
      Act. The security may be resold pursuant to an exemption from registration
      under the 1933 Act, typically to qualified institutional buyers. Pursuant
      to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, this security has
      been determined to be liquid by the Advisor. Although market instability
      can result in periods of increased overall market illiquidity, liquidity
      for the security is determined based on security-specific factors and
      assumptions, which require subjective judgment. At November 30, 2016,
      security noted as such amounted to $25,675 or 0.0% of net assets.

(k)   This security is fair valued by the Advisor's Pricing Committee in
      accordance with procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in
      accordance with the provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
      amended. At November 30, 2016, investments noted as such are valued at $58
      or 0.0% of net assets.

(l)   This security is restricted and cannot be offered for public sale without
      first being registered under the 1933 Act. Prior to registration,
      restricted securities may only be resold in transactions exempt from
      registration (See Note 2D - Restricted Securities in the Notes to
      Financial Statements).

(m)   Aggregate cost for financial reporting purposes, which approximates the
      aggregate cost for federal income tax purposes. As of November 30, 2016,
      the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all securities in which
      there was an excess of value over tax cost was $3,315,664 and the
      aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there
      was an excess of tax cost over value was $11,699,059.

*     See the Portfolio of Investments for the industry breakout. Industry
      categories are only shown separately if they include holdings in two or
      more levels or have holdings in only Level 3.

**    Investment is valued at $0.

All transfers in and out of the Levels during the period are assumed to be
transferred on the last day of the period at their current value. There were no
transfers between Levels at November 30, 2016.

Level 3 Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests and Rights that are fair valued by
the Advisor's Pricing Committee are footnoted in the Portfolio of Investments.
Level 3 Senior Floating-Rate Loan Interests are valued based on either
third-party pricing service prices obtained from dealer runs and indicative
sheets from brokers or are valued using broker quotes. The Level 3 Rights values
are based on unobservable and non-quantitative inputs. The Fund's Board of
Trustees has adopted valuation procedures that are utilized by the Advisor's
Pricing Committee to oversee the day-to-day valuation of the Fund's investments.
The Advisor's Pricing Committee, through the Fund's fund accounting agent,
monitors the daily pricing via tolerance checks and stale and unchanged price
reviews. The Advisor's Pricing Committee also reviews monthly back testing of
third-party pricing service prices by comparing sales prices of the Fund's
investments to prior day third-party pricing service prices. Additionally, the
Advisor's Pricing Committee reviews periodic information from the Fund's
third-party pricing service that compares secondary market trade prices to their
daily valuations.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)


                                1. ORGANIZATION

First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a diversified,
closed-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business
trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
"1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund attempts to preserve capital. The
Fund pursues these objectives by investing primarily in a portfolio of senior
secured floating-rate loan interests ("Senior Loans")(1). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investing in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Fund is considered an investment company and follows accounting and
reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting
Standards Codification Topic 946, "Financial Services-Investment Companies." The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed
by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The preparation of
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is determined daily
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. If the NYSE closes early on a
valuation day, the NAV is determined as of that time. Domestic debt securities
and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of
the principal markets for those securities. The Fund's NAV per Common Share is
calculated by dividing the value of all assets of the Fund (including accrued
interest and dividends), less all liabilities (including accrued expenses,
dividends declared but unpaid and any borrowings of the Fund), by the total
number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value. Market
value prices represent last sale or official closing prices from a national or
foreign exchange (i.e., a regulated market) and are primarily obtained from
third-party pricing services. Fair value prices represent any prices not
considered market value prices and are either obtained from a third-party
pricing service or are determined by the Pricing Committee of the Fund's
investment advisor, First Trust Advisors L.P. ("First Trust" or the "Advisor"),
in accordance with valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees,
and in accordance with provisions of the 1940 Act. Investments valued by the
Advisor's Pricing Committee, if any, are footnoted as such in the footnotes to
the Portfolio of Investments. The Fund's investments are valued as follows:

      The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any
      securities exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought
      and sold by institutional investors in individually negotiated private
      transactions that function in many respects like an over-the-counter
      secondary market, although typically no formal market-makers exist. This
      market, while having grown substantially since its inception, generally
      has fewer trades and less liquidity than the secondary market for other
      types of securities. Some Senior Loans have few or no trades, or trade
      infrequently, and information regarding a specific Senior Loan may not be
      widely available or may be incomplete. Accordingly, determinations of the
      fair market value of Senior Loans may be based on infrequent and dated
      information. Because there is less reliable, objective data available,
      elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior Loans
      than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are fair
      valued using information provided by a third-party pricing service. The
      third-party pricing service primarily uses over-the-counter pricing from
      dealer runs and broker quotes from indicative sheets to value the Senior
      Loans. If the third-party pricing service cannot or does not provide a
      valuation for a particular Senior Loan or such valuation is deemed
      unreliable, the Advisor's Pricing Committee may value such Senior Loan at
      a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
      Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Fair
      valuation of a Senior Loan is based on the consideration of all available
      information, including, but not limited to the following:

      1)    the fundamental business data relating to the borrower/issuer;
      2)    an evaluation of the forces which influence the market in which
            these securities are purchased and sold;
      3)    the type, size and cost of a security;
      4)    the financial statements of the borrower/issuer;
      5)    the credit quality and cash flow of the borrower/issuer, based on
            the Advisor's or external analysis;
      6)    the information as to any transactions in or offers for the
            security;

-----------------------------
(1)   The terms "security" and "securities" used throughout the Notes to
      Financial Statements include Senior Loans.


                                                                         Page 21

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

      7)    the price and extent of public trading in similar securities (or
            equity securities) of the borrower/issuer, or comparable companies;
      8)    the coupon payments;
      9)    the quality, value and salability of collateral, if any, securing
            the security;
     10)    the business prospects of the borrower/issuer, including any ability
            to obtain money or resources from a parent or affiliate and an
            assessment of the borrower's/issuer's management;
     11)    the prospects for the borrower's/issuer's industry, and multiples
            (of earnings and/or cash flows) being paid for similar businesses in
            that industry;
     12)    borrower's/issuer's competitive position within the industry;
     13)    borrower's/issuer's ability to access additional liquidity through
            public and/or private markets; and
     14)    other relevant factors.

      Common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or
      foreign exchange (excluding The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") and the
      London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market ("AIM")) are valued at
      the last sale price on the exchange on which they are principally traded
      or, for Nasdaq and AIM securities, the official closing price. Securities
      traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale
      price or official closing price, as applicable, at the close of the
      securities exchange representing the principal market for such securities.

      Securities traded in an over-the-counter market are fair valued at the
      mean of their most recent bid and asked price, if available, and otherwise
      at their closing bid price.

      Corporate bonds, corporate notes and other debt securities are valued on
      the basis of valuations provided by dealers who make markets in such
      securities or by a third-party pricing service approved by the Fund's
      Board of Trustees, which may use the following valuation inputs when
      available:

      1)    benchmark yields;
      2)    reported trades;
      3)    broker/dealer quotes;
      4)    issuer spreads;
      5)    benchmark securities;
      6)    bids and offers; and
      7)    reference data including market research publications.

      Fixed-income and other debt securities having a remaining maturity of 60
      days or less when purchased are fair valued at cost adjusted for
      amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts (amortized cost),
      provided the Advisor's Pricing Committee has determined that the use of
      amortized cost is an appropriate reflection of fair value given market and
      issuer-specific conditions existing at the time of the determination.
      Factors that may be considered in determining the appropriateness of the
      use of amortized cost include, but are not limited to, the following:

      1)    the credit conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      2)    the liquidity conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto;
      3)    the interest rate conditions in the relevant market and changes
            thereto (such as significant changes in interest rates);
      4)    issuer-specific conditions (such as significant credit
            deterioration); and
      5)    any other market-based data the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            considers relevant. In this regard, the Advisor's Pricing Committee
            may use last-obtained market-based data to assist it when valuing
            portfolio securities using amortized cost.

Certain securities may not be able to be priced by pre-established pricing
methods. Such securities may be valued by the Fund's Board of Trustees or its
delegate, the Advisor's Pricing Committee, at fair value. These securities
generally include, but are not limited to, restricted securities (securities
which may not be publicly sold without registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "1933 Act")) for which a third-party pricing service is
unable to provide a market price; securities whose trading has been formally
suspended; a security whose market or fair value price is not available from a
pre-established pricing source; a security with respect to which an event has
occurred that is likely to materially affect the value of the security after the
market has closed but before the calculation of the Fund's NAV or make it
difficult or impossible to obtain a reliable market quotation; and a security
whose price, as provided by the third-party pricing service, does not reflect
the security's fair value. As a general principle, the current fair value of a
security would appear to be the amount which the owner might reasonably expect
to receive for the security upon its current sale. When fair value prices are
used, generally they will differ from market quotations or official closing
prices on the applicable exchanges. A variety of factors may be considered in
determining the fair value of such securities, including, but not limited to,
the following:

      1)    the type of security;
      2)    the size of the holding;
      3)    the initial cost of the security;

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

      4)    transactions in comparable securities;
      5)    price quotes from dealers and/or third-party pricing services;
      6)    relationships among various securities;
      7)    information obtained by contacting the issuer, analysts, or the
            appropriate stock exchange;
      8)    an analysis of the issuer's financial statements; and
      9)    the existence of merger proposals or tender offers that might affect
            the value of the security.

The Fund is subject to fair value accounting standards that define fair value,
establish the framework for measuring fair value and provide a three-level
hierarchy for fair valuation based upon the inputs to the valuation as of the
measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

      o     Level 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for
            identical investments. An active market is a market in which
            transactions for the investment occur with sufficient frequency and
            volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

      o     Level 2 - Level 2 inputs are observable inputs, either directly or
            indirectly, and include the following:

            o     Quoted prices for similar investments in active markets.

            o     Quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets
                  that are non-active. A non-active market is a market where
                  there are few transactions for the investment, the prices are
                  not current, or price quotations vary substantially either
                  over time or among market makers, or in which little
                  information is released publicly.

            o     Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
                  investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves
                  observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities,
                  prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default
                  rates).

            o     Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by
                  observable market data by correlation or other means.

      o     Level 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. Unobservable
            inputs may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the
            assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
            investment.

The inputs or methodologies used for valuing investments are not necessarily an
indication of the risk associated with investing in those investments. A summary
of the inputs used to value the Fund's investments as of November 30, 2016, is
included with the Fund's Portfolio of Investments.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME

Security transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward
purchase commitment basis may have extended settlement periods. The value of the
security so purchased is subject to market fluctuations during this period. Due
to the nature of the Senior Loan market, the actual settlement date may not be
certain at the time of the purchase or sale for some of the Senior Loans.
Interest income on such Senior Loans is not accrued until settlement date. The
Fund maintains liquid assets with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued, delayed delivery or forward purchase commitments. The Fund
had no when-issued, delayed-delivery or forward purchase commitments as of
November 30, 2016.

C. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. The Fund had no unfunded delayed draw loan commitments as
of November 30, 2016.

D. RESTRICTED SECURITIES

The Fund invests in restricted securities, which are securities that may not be
offered for public sale without first being registered under the 1933 Act. Prior
to registration, restricted securities may only be resold in transactions exempt
from registration under Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, normally to qualified
institutional buyers. As of November 30, 2016, the Fund held restricted
securities as shown in the following table. The Fund does not have the right to
demand that such securities be registered. These securities are valued according
to the valuation procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation footnote (Note
2A) and are not expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable
unrestricted investment. There are no unrestricted investments with the same
maturity date and yield for this issuer.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)


E. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with leverage, if any. Distributions of any net long-term capital
gains earned by the Fund are distributed at least annually. Distributions will
automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares pursuant to the Fund's
Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are elected by the
shareholder.

Distributions from net investment income and realized capital gains are
determined in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
GAAP. Certain capital accounts in the financial statements are periodically
adjusted for permanent differences in order to reflect their tax character.
These permanent differences are primarily due to the varying treatment of income
and gain/loss on significantly modified portfolio securities held by the Fund
and have no impact on net assets or net asset value per share. Temporary
differences, which arise from recognizing certain items of income, expense and
gain/loss in different periods for financial statement and tax purposes, will
reverse at some time in the future.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2016 was as follows:

Distributions paid from:
Ordinary income....................................   $ 23,493,344

As of May 31, 2016, the components of distributable earnings and net assets on a
tax basis were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income......................   $     61,467
Undistributed capital gains........................             --
                                                      ------------
Total undistributed earnings.......................         61,467
Accumulated capital and other losses...............   (108,523,298)
Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation).........    (17,498,743)
                                                      ------------
Total accumulated earnings (losses)................   (125,960,574)
Other..............................................             --
Paid-in capital....................................    500,645,942
                                                      ------------
Net assets.........................................   $374,685,368
                                                      ============

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, which includes distributing substantially all of its net
investment income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for federal and state income taxes. However, due to the
timing and amount of distributions, the Fund may be subject to an excise tax of
4% of the amount by which approximately 98% of the Fund's taxable income exceeds
the distributions from such taxable income for the calendar year.

Under the Regulated Investment Company Modernization Act of 2010 (the "Act"),
net capital losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010,
may be carried forward indefinitely, and their character is retained as
short-term and/or long-term losses. Previously, net capital losses were carried
forward for up to eight years and treated as short-term losses. As a transition
rule, the Act requires that post-enactment net capital losses be used before
pre-enactment net capital losses. At May 31, 2016, for federal income tax
purposes, the Fund had capital loss carryforwards available that are shown in
the following table, to the extent provided by regulation, to offset future
capital gains through the years indicated. To the extent that these loss
carryforwards are used to offset future capital gains, it is probable that the
capital gains offset will not be distributed to the Fund shareholders.

</TABLE>

At the taxable year ended May 31, 2016, the Fund had $422,155 of pre-enactment
capital loss carryforwards that expired.

The Fund is subject to certain limitations under the U.S. tax rules on the use
of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized built-in losses. These
limitations apply when there has been a 50% change in ownership.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

Certain losses realized during the current fiscal year may be deferred and
treated as occurring the first day of the following fiscal year for federal
income tax purposes. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, the Fund incurred
and elected to defer net ordinary and capital losses as follows:

Qualified Late Year Losses:

Ordinary Losses       $          --
Capital Losses            5,550,904

The Fund is subject to accounting standards that establish a minimum threshold
for recognizing, and a system for measuring, the benefits of a tax position
taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Taxable years ended 2013, 2014,
2015 and 2016 remain open to federal and state audit. As of November 30, 2016,
management has evaluated the application of these standards to the Fund and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements for uncertain tax positions.

G. EXPENSES

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

H. NEW AND AMENDED FINANCIAL RULES AND FORMS

On October 13, 2016, the SEC adopted new rules and forms, and amended existing
rules and forms. The new and amended rules and forms are intended to modernize
the reporting of information provided by funds and to improve the quality and
type of information that funds provide to the SEC and investors. The new and
amended rules and forms will be effective for the First Trust funds, including
the Fund, for reporting periods beginning on and after June 1, 2018. Management
is evaluating the new and amended rules and forms to determine the impact to the
Fund.

3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE, AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FEE ARRANGEMENTS

First Trust, the investment advisor to the Fund, is a limited
partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of DuPage L.P., and one
general partner, The Charger Corporation. The Charger Corporation is an Illinois
corporation controlled by James A. Bowen, Chief Executive Officer of First
Trust. First Trust is responsible for the selection and ongoing monitoring of
the Fund's investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and
providing certain administrative services necessary for the management of the
Fund. For these investment management services, First Trust is entitled to a
monthly fee calculated at an annual rate of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets
(the average daily total asset value of the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's
liabilities other than the principal amount of borrowings). First Trust also
provides fund reporting services to the Fund for a flat annual fee in the amount
of $9,250.

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNYM IS") serves as the Fund's
administrator, fund accountant and transfer agent in accordance with certain fee
arrangements. As administrator and fund accountant, BNYM IS is responsible for
providing certain administrative and accounting services to the Fund, including
maintaining the Fund's books of account, records of the Fund's securities
transactions, and certain other books and records. As transfer agent, BNYM IS is
responsible for maintaining shareholder records for the Fund. The Bank of New
York Mellon ("BNYM") serves as the Fund's custodian in accordance with certain
fee arrangements. As custodian, BNYM is responsible for custody of the Fund's
assets. BNYM IS and BNYM are subsidiaries of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation, a financial holding company.

Each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust, any sub-advisor
or any of their affiliates ("Independent Trustees") is paid a fixed annual
retainer that is allocated equally among each fund in the First Trust Fund
Complex. Each Independent Trustee is also paid an annual per fund fee that
varies based on whether the fund is a closed-end or other actively managed fund,
or is an index fund.

Additionally, the Lead Independent Trustee and the Chairmen of the Audit
Committee, Nominating and Governance Committee and Valuation Committee are paid
annual fees to serve in such capacities, with such compensation allocated pro
rata among each fund in the First Trust Fund Complex based on net assets.
Independent Trustees are reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with all meetings. The Lead Independent Trustee and Committee
Chairmen rotate every three years. The officers and "Interested" Trustee receive
no compensation from the Fund for acting in such capacities.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)


                                 5. BORROWINGS

The Fund has a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement (the "Credit Facility")
with Liberty Street Funding LLC as conduit lender and The Bank of Nova Scotia as
secondary lender and agent for the secured parties under the agreement. The
Credit Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund
assets are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the terms of the
Credit Facility, the loans under the Credit Facility bear interest for each
settlement period at a rate per annum based on the commercial paper rate of the
conduit lender. Effective July 8, 2016, the Credit Facility was amended, whereby
the expiration date of the Credit Facility was extended until July 7, 2017 and
the total commitment was reduced from $180,000,000 to $170,000,000. The Credit
Facility may be renewed annually. Under the requirements of the 1940 Act, the
Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have "asset coverage" of at
least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after borrowings). The Fund pays
a utilization fee at a per annum rate of 0.3625% of the daily average of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances during the prior calendar
month, and a commitment fee at a per annum rate of the product of (i) 0.3625% of
the daily average of the total commitment in effect (or if terminated, the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the advances funded or maintained)
during the preceding calendar month and (ii) 1.02.

For the six months ended November 30, 2016, the average amount outstanding under
the Credit Facility was $154,502,732. As of November 30, 2016, the Fund had
outstanding borrowings of $168,000,000. The high and low annual interest rates
for the loan under the Credit Facility funded by the conduit lender during the
six months ended November 30, 2016, were 0.94% and 0.70%, respectively, with a
weighted average interest rate of 0.81%. The annual interest rate in effect for
the loan at November 30, 2016, was 0.94%.

                               6. INDEMNIFICATION

The Fund has a variety of indemnification obligations under contracts with its
service providers. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown. However, the Fund has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these
contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.

                                 7. LITIGATION

The Fund has been named as a defendant in litigation pending in the Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York as part of the General Motors
bankruptcy case. The plaintiff, the Motors Liquidation Company Avoidance Action
Trust, is an entity formed under the bankruptcy plan of reorganization to
prosecute "avoidance" actions such as preference actions. The lawsuit arises
from years of ancillary litigation concerning whether the former holders of a
term loan to General Motors ("GM"), for which JP Morgan acted as agent, lost
their lien on GM collateral when a Uniform Commercial Code release was
mistakenly filed terminating their interest in certain collateral securing the
term loan. On January 21, 2015, the federal appeals court in New York ruled that
the term lenders' collateral interest was, indeed, terminated.

By virtue of the federal appellate court's decision, all of the former holders
of the term loan, including the Fund, are now being sued in the bankruptcy court
in New York for the avoidance and return of certain payments they received both
before and after the GM bankruptcy filing. The bankruptcy court lawsuit is
premised on the assertion that the term lenders received payments on account of
their status as fully secured creditors when in fact they should not have
received the payments because they were not in fact secured.

The Fund was first served following the filing of the First Amended Complaint on
May 20, 2015. The payments which were received by the Fund in 2009 and which the
plaintiff seeks to recover from the Fund total $8,057,298.44. The Fund has
engaged counsel to assist with its defense of this matter. Based on the current
status of the litigation, the Fund cannot predict the outcome of the litigation
at this time or the impact to Fund net assets, if any.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Management has evaluated the impact of all subsequent events to the Fund through
the date the financial statements were issued, and has determined that there
were the following subsequent events:

On December 20, 2016, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.0675 per share to
Common Shareholders of record on January 5, 2017, payable January 17, 2017.

On January 19, 2017, the Fund declared a distribution of $0.0675 per share to
Common Shareholders of record on February 3, 2017, payable February 15, 2017.

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)


                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by BNY
Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common
Shares under the Plan. If you elect to receive cash distributions, you will
receive all distributions in cash paid by check mailed directly to you by the
Plan Agent, as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (866) 340-1104, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and the Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing (US) Inc., 301 Bellevue Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                              RISK CONSIDERATIONS

Risks are inherent in all investing. The following summarizes some, but not all,
of the risks that should be considered for the Fund. For additional information
about the risks associated with investing in the Fund, please see the Fund's
prospectus and statement of additional information, as well as other Fund
regulatory filings.

INVESTMENT AND MARKET RISK: An investment in the Fund's Common Shares is subject
to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal
invested. An investment in Common Shares represents an indirect investment in
the securities owned by the Fund. The value of these securities, like other
market investments, may move up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably.
Common Shares at any point in time may be worth less than the original
investment, even after taking into account the reinvestment of Fund dividends
and distributions. Security prices can fluctuate for several reasons including
the general condition of the securities markets, or when political or economic
events affecting the issuers occur. When the Advisor or Sub-Advisor determines
that it is temporarily unable to follow the Fund's investment strategy or that
it is impractical to do so (such as when a market disruption event has occurred
and trading in the securities is extremely limited or absent), the Fund may take
temporary defensive positions.

HIGH-YIELD SECURITIES RISK: The Fund may invest up to 100% of its Managed Assets
in lower grade debt securities, which may also be referred to as below
investment grade debt securities. The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are
generally rated below investment grade by one or more rating agencies and are
considered to be "high-yield" securities. High-yield securities should be
considered speculative as their low ratings indicate a quality of less than
investment grade, and therefore carry an increased risk of default as compared
to investment grade issues. Because high-yield securities are generally
subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors to be riskier than
higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more than higher rated
securities and are affected by short-term credit developments to a greater
degree. High yield securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and
risk of loss than securities with higher ratings. A reduction in an issuer's
creditworthiness may result in the bankruptcy of an issuer or the default by an
issuer on the interest and principal payments. The high yield securities in
which the Fund invests are not listed on a national securities exchange. Due to
the smaller, less liquid market for the high yield securities, the bid-offer
spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade
securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to
complete. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, the market for high yield debt has
experienced decreased liquidity, and investor perception of increased risk has
caused yield spreads to widen.

LEVERAGE RISK: The use of leverage results in additional risks and can magnify
the effect of any losses. If the income and gains from the securities and
investments purchased with such proceeds do not cover the cost of leverage, the
Common Shares' return will be less than if leverage had not been used. The Fund
borrowed pursuant to a leverage borrowing program, which constitutes a
substantial lien and burden by reason of their prior claim against the income of
the Fund and against the net assets of the Fund in liquidation. The rights of
lenders to receive payments of interest on and repayments of principal on any
borrowings made by the Fund under a leverage borrowing program are senior to the
rights of holders of Common Shares, with respect to the payment of dividends or
upon liquidation. If the Fund is not in compliance with certain Credit Facility
provisions, the Fund may not be permitted to declare dividends or other
distributions, including dividends and distributions with respect to Common
Shares or purchase Common Shares. The use of leverage by the Fund increases the
likelihood of greater volatility of NAV and market price of the Common Shares.
Leverage also increases the risk that fluctuations in interest rates on
borrowings and short-term debt that the Fund may pay will reduce the return to
the Common Shareholders or will result in fluctuations in the dividends paid on
the Common Shares.

SENIOR LOAN RISK: In the event a borrower fails to pay scheduled interest or
principal payments on a Senior Loan held by the Fund, the Fund will experience a
reduction in its income and a decline in the market value of the Senior Loan,
which will likely reduce dividends and lead to a decline in the net asset value
of the Fund's Common Shares. If the Fund acquires a Senior Loan from another
lender, for example, by acquiring a participation, the Fund may also be subject
to credit risks with respect to that lender. Although Senior Loans may be

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

secured by specific Collateral, the value of the collateral may not equal the
fund's investment when the senior loan is acquired or may decline below the
principal amount of the senior loan subsequent to the fund's investment. Also,
to the extent that collateral consists of stock of the borrower or its
subsidiaries or affiliates, the fund bears the risk that the stock may decline
in value, be relatively illiquid, and/or may lose all or substantially all of
its value, causing the senior loan to be under collateralized. Therefore, the
liquidation of the collateral underlying a senior loan may not satisfy the
issuer's obligation to the fund in the event of non-payment of scheduled
interest or principal, and the collateral may not be readily liquidated.

RESTRICTED SECURITIES RISK: Investments in restricted securities could have the
effect of increasing the amount of the Fund's assets invested in illiquid
securities if qualified institutional buyers are willing to purchase these
securities. Illiquid and restricted securities may be difficult to dispose of at
the price at which the Fund has valued the securities and at the times when the
Fund believes it is desirable to do so. The market price of illiquid and
restricted securities generally is more volatile than that of more liquid
securities, which may adversely affect the price that the Fund recovers upon the
sale of such securities. Investment of the Fund's assets in illiquid and
restricted securities may restrict the Fund's ability to take advantage of
market opportunities.

CREDIT RISK: Credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security held by the
Fund will be unable or unwilling to make dividend, interest and/or principal
payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline
because of concerns about the issuer's ability to make such payments. Credit
risk may be heightened for the Fund because it invests a substantial portion of
its net assets in "high yield" or "junk" debt; such securities involve greater
risks, including the possibility of dividend or interest deferral, default or
bankruptcy, and are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the
issuer's capacity to pay dividends or interest and repay principal. Credit risk
is heightened for loans in which the Fund invests because companies that issue
such loans tend to be highly leveraged and thus are more susceptible to the
risks of interest deferral, default and/or bankruptcy.

INTEREST RATE RISK: The Fund's portfolio is also subject to interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk is the risk that fixed-income securities will decline in
value because of changes in market interest rates. Investments in debt
securities with long-term maturities may experience significant price declines
if long-term interest rates increase.

PRE-PAYMENT RISK: Loans are subject to pre-payment risk. The degree to which
borrowers prepay loans, whether as a contractual requirement or at their
election, may be affected by general business conditions, the financial
condition of the borrower and competitive conditions among loan investors, among
others. As such, prepayments cannot be predicted with accuracy. Upon a
prepayment, either in part or in full, the actual outstanding debt on which the
Fund derives interest income will be reduced. The Fund may not be able to
reinvest the proceeds received on terms as favorable as the prepaid loan.

LIQUIDITY RISK: The Fund invests a substantial portion of its assets in
lower-quality debt issued by companies that are highly leveraged. Lower-quality
debt tends to be less liquid than higher-quality debt. Moreover, smaller debt
issues tend to be less liquid than larger debt issues. Although the resale, or
secondary market for Senior Loans is growing, it is currently limited. There is
no organized exchange or board of trade on which Senior Loans are traded.
Instead, the secondary market for Senior Loans is an unregulated inter-dealer or
inter-bank resale market. In addition, Senior Loans in which the Fund invests
may require the consent of the borrower and/or agent prior to the settlement of
the sale or assignment. These consent requirements can delay or impede the
Fund's ability to settle the sale of Senior Loans. If the economy experiences a
sudden downturn, or if the market for the Senior Loans in which the Fund invests
becomes distressed, the Fund may have difficulty disposing of Senior Loans if it
needs cash to repay debt, to pay dividends, to pay expenses or to take advantage
of new investment opportunities.

                        INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING APPROVAL OF CONTINUATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT
AGREEMENT

The Board of Trustees (the "Board") of First Trust Senior Floating Rate Income
Fund II (the "Fund"), including the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved
the continuation of the Investment Management Agreement (the "Agreement")
between the Fund and First Trust Advisors L.P. (the "Advisor") for a one-year
period ending June 30, 2017 at a meeting held on June 13, 2016. The Board
determined that the continuation of the Agreement is in the best interests of
the Fund in light of the extent and quality of the services provided and such
other matters as the Board considered to be relevant in the exercise of its
reasonable business judgment.

To reach this determination, the Board considered its duties under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as well as under
the general principles of state law in reviewing and approving advisory
contracts; the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the fiduciary duty
of investment advisors with respect to advisory agreements and compensation; the
standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have
fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by the Board in voting
on such agreements. At meetings held on April 22, 2016 and June 13, 2016, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, reviewed materials provided by the
Advisor responding to requests for information from counsel to the Independent
Trustees that, among other things, outlined the services provided by the Advisor
to the Fund (including the relevant personnel responsible for these services and
their experience); the advisory fee rate payable by the Fund as compared to fees
charged to a peer group of funds compiled by Management Practice, Inc. ("MPI"),
an independent source (the "MPI Peer Group"), and as compared to fees charged to
other clients of the Advisor; expenses of the Fund as compared to expense ratios
of the funds in the MPI Peer Group; performance information for the Fund; the
nature of expenses incurred in providing services to the


                                                                         Page 29

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

Fund and the potential for economies of scale, if any; financial data on the
Advisor; any fall out benefits to the Advisor; and information on the Advisor's
compliance program. The Board reviewed initial materials with the Advisor at a
special meeting held on April 22, 2016, prior to which the Independent Trustees
and their counsel met separately to discuss the information provided by the
Advisor. Following the April meeting, independent legal counsel on behalf of the
Independent Trustees requested certain clarifications and supplements to the
materials provided, and the information provided in response to those requests
was considered at an executive session of the Independent Trustees and
independent legal counsel held prior to the June 13, 2016 meeting, as well as at
the meeting held that day. The Board applied its business judgment to determine
whether the arrangement between the Fund and the Advisor continues to be a
reasonable business arrangement from the Fund's perspective as well as from the
perspective of the Fund's shareholders. The Board determined that, given the
totality of the information provided with respect to the Agreement, the Board
had received sufficient information to renew the Agreement. The Board considered
that shareholders chose to invest or remain invested in the Fund knowing that
the Advisor manages the Fund.

In reviewing the Agreement, the Board considered the nature, extent and quality
of the services provided by the Advisor under the Agreement. The Board
considered that the Advisor is responsible for the overall management and
administration of the Fund and reviewed all of the services provided by the
Advisor to the Fund, as well as the background and experience of the persons
responsible for such services. The Board noted that the Advisor's Leveraged
Finance Investment Team is responsible for the day-to-day management of the
Fund's investments and considered the background and experience of the members
of the Leveraged Finance Investment Team. The Board considered the Advisor's
statement that it applies the same oversight model internally with its Leveraged
Finance Investment Team as it uses for overseeing external sub-advisors. In
reviewing the services provided, the Board noted the compliance program that had
been developed by the Advisor and considered that it includes a robust program
for monitoring the Advisor's and the Fund's compliance with the 1940 Act, as
well as the Fund's compliance with its investment objectives and policies. In
addition, as part of the Board's consideration of the Advisor's services, the
Advisor, in its written materials and at the April 22, 2016 meeting, described
to the Board the scope of its ongoing investment in additional infrastructure
and personnel to maintain and improve the quality of services provided to the
Fund and the other funds in the First Trust Fund Complex. In light of the
information presented and the considerations made, the Board concluded that the
nature, extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund by the Advisor
under the Agreement have been and are expected to remain satisfactory and that
the Advisor has managed the Fund consistent with its investment objectives and
policies. The Board considered the advisory fee rate payable under the Agreement
for the services provided. The Board received and reviewed information showing
the advisory fee rates and expense ratios of the peer funds in the MPI Peer
Group, as well as advisory fee rates charged by the Advisor to other fund and
non-fund clients. With respect to the MPI Peer Group, the Board discussed with
representatives of the Advisor the limitations in creating a relevant peer group
for the Fund, including that (i) the Fund is unique in its composition, which
makes assembling peers with similar strategies and asset mix difficult; (ii)
peer funds may use different amounts and types of leverage with different costs
associated with them; and (iii) some of the peer funds are part of a larger fund
complex that may allow for additional economies of scale. The Board took these
limitations into account in considering the peer data, and noted that the
advisory fee rate payable by the Fund, based on average net assets, was slightly
above the median of the MPI Peer Group. With respect to fees charged to other
clients, the Board considered differences between the Fund and other clients
that limited their comparability. In considering the advisory fee rate overall,
the Board also considered the Advisor's statement that it seeks to meet investor
needs through innovative and value-added investment solutions and the Advisor's
description of its long-term commitment to the Fund.

The Board considered performance information for the Fund. The Board noted the
process it has established for monitoring the Fund's performance and portfolio
risk on an ongoing basis, which includes quarterly performance reporting from
the Advisor for the Fund. The Board determined that this process continues to be
effective for reviewing the Fund's performance. The Board received and reviewed
information comparing the Fund's performance for periods ended December 31, 2015
to the performance of the MPI Peer Group and to two benchmark indexes. In
reviewing the Fund's performance as compared to the performance of the MPI Peer
Group, the Board took into account the limitations described above with respect
to creating a relevant peer group for the Fund. Based on the information
provided on net asset value performance, the Board noted that the Fund
outperformed the MPI Peer Group average for the one-, three- and five-year
periods ended December 31, 2015. The Board also noted that the Fund outperformed
both benchmark indexes for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ended
December 31, 2015. In addition, the Board considered information provided by the
Advisor on the impact of leverage on the Fund's returns. The Board also received
information on the Fund's annual distribution rate as of December 31, 2015 and
the Fund's average trading discount during 2015 and comparable information for
the peer group.

On the basis of all the information provided on the fees, expenses and
performance of the Fund, and the ongoing oversight by the Board, the Board
concluded that the advisory fees continue to be reasonable and appropriate in
light of the nature, extent and quality of the services provided by the Advisor
to the Fund under the Agreement.

The Board considered information and discussed with the Advisor whether there
were any economies of scale in connection with providing advisory services to
the Fund and noted the Advisor's statement that it expects its expenses to
increase over the next twelve months as the Advisor continues to make
investments in personnel and infrastructure. The Board determined that due to
the Fund's closed-end structure, the potential for realization of economies of
scale as Fund assets grow was not a material factor to be considered. The Board
considered the revenues and allocated costs (including the allocation
methodology) of the Advisor in serving as investment advisor to the Fund for the

             FIRST TRUST SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                         NOVEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)

twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the estimated profitability level for
the Fund calculated by the Advisor based on such data, as well as complex-wide
and product-line profitability data for the same period. The Board noted the
inherent limitations in the profitability analysis, and concluded that based on
the information provided, the Advisor's profitability level for the Fund was not
unreasonable. In addition, the Board considered fall-out benefits described by
the Advisor that may be realized from its relationship with the Fund, including
the Advisor's compensation for fund reporting services pursuant to a separate
Fund Reporting Services Agreement. The Board also noted that the Advisor does
not utilize soft dollars in connection with its management of the Fund's
portfolio.

Based on all of the information considered and the conclusions reached, the
Board, including the Independent Trustees, unanimously determined that the terms
of the Agreement continue to be fair and reasonable and that the continuation of
the Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund. No single factor was
determinative in the Board's analysis.
