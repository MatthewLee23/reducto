1.   ORGANIZATION

Columbia  Management  Multi-Strategy  Hedge Fund, LLC ("the Fund") is a Delaware
limited liability company  registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
as amended  (the  "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,  management
investment  company and which has many of the  features of a private  investment
fund. The Fund's interests  ("Interests") are offered only in private placements
to persons (i) who are both  "accredited  investors" under the Securities Act of
1933 and  "qualified  clients"  under the  Investment  Advisers Act of 1940,  as
amended and (ii) who meet other investor eligibility criteria established by the
Fund. The primary investment  objective of the Fund is to provide investors with
an  attractive,  long-term  rate  of  return,  on  an  absolute  as  well  as  a
risk-adjusted  basis,  with low performance  volatility and minimal  correlation
with the equity and fixed income  markets.  The Fund's strategy is to (i) invest
in approximately  25-50 partnerships and other investment  vehicles  ("Portfolio
Funds") managed by different  investment managers and (ii) construct a portfolio
employing  various  arbitrage and equity  strategies to achieve the risk control
benefits  of  diversification  together  with the  value of a hedged  investment
approach.

Columbia Management Advisors,  Inc. (the "Adviser") is the investment adviser to
the Fund.  Prior to April 1, 2004,  the Adviser was an  indirect,  wholly  owned
subsidiary of FleetBoston Financial Corporation ("FleetBoston"). Effective April
1, 2004,  FleetBoston was acquired by Bank of America  ("BOA").  The Adviser has
retained Grosvenor Capital Management, L.P. ("Grosvenor" or the "Subadviser") as
subadviser to the Fund. The Adviser and the Subadviser  have been  designated as
special members (the "Special Members") of the Fund.

The Subadviser is responsible for  implementing the Fund's  investment  strategy
and  managing  the  Fund's  investment  portfolio  on  a  day-to-day  basis,  in
accordance with the investment  objective,  philosophy and strategy described in
the Fund's  confidential  offering  memorandum  and subject to  oversight by the
Adviser and the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Fund.




                                                                               8

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.   USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates and  assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

B.   PORTFOLIO VALUATION

The  Fund's  investments  are  fair  valued  by the  Adviser  or  Subadviser  in
accordance  with  policies and  procedures  that seek to ensure that the Fund is
able to reliably determine the value of it's investments in the Portfolio Funds.
Investments in Portfolio  Funds are generally  valued at net asset value,  which
approximates  fair  value,  as  reported  by the  administrators  or  investment
managers of the  Portfolio  Funds.  Such values  generally  represent the Fund's
proportionate share of the net assets of the Portfolio Funds.  Accordingly,  the
value of  investments  in Portfolio  Funds is generally  increased by additional
contributions  to the Portfolio  Funds and the Fund's share of net earnings from
the  Portfolio  Funds and decreased by  withdrawals  and the Fund's share of net
losses from the Portfolio Funds.

The Portfolio Funds' administrators or investment managers generally value their
investments at fair value. Listed investment  securities are generally valued by
an independent pricing source. Securities with no readily available market value
are initially  valued at cost,  with  subsequent  adjustments  to values,  which
reflect either the basis of meaningful  third-party  transactions in the private
market, or fair value deemed appropriate by Portfolio Funds' management. In such
instances,  consideration is also given to the financial condition and operating
results of the issuer, the amount that the Portfolio Funds can reasonably expect
to realize upon sale of the securities and other factors deemed relevant.

C.   INCOME RECOGNITION

Interest  income and expenses are recorded on the accrual basis.  Realized gains
and losses from  Portfolio  Fund  transactions  are calculated on the identified
cost basis.




                                                                               9

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D.   INCOME TAXES

The Fund is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. No federal
or state taxes have been  provided on profits of the Fund since the members (the
"Investors") are  individually  required to report on their own tax return their
distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

E.   CASH

At  September  30, 2004, a total of $609,404 in cash was held on deposit at PFPC
Trust  Company,  the Fund's  custodian.  Of that amount,  $141,668 was held in a
segregated  account at PFPC Trust  Company  related to holdbacks on  withdrawals
from investors in the Fund.

F.   ORGANIZATIONAL AND OFFERING EXPENSES

The Adviser entered into an expense  deferral  agreement (the "Expense  Deferral
Agreement") with the Fund dated December 19, 2002, as amended December 31, 2002,
whereby the Fund,  upon request of the Adviser,  agrees to repay $366,088 to the
Adviser for organizational and initial offering costs advanced by the Adviser on
behalf of the Fund, subject to certain conditions.  Such repayment is contingent
upon the expenses of the Fund (exclusive of brokerage costs, interest,  taxes or
extraordinary expenses and management fees or performance-based fees paid by the
Fund),  including such repayment,  being limited to no more than 0.75% per annum
of  average  members'  capital  of the  Fund.  The  Expense  Deferral  Agreement
terminates  on April 1,  2006,  and the  Fund  has no  obligation  to pay to the
Adviser any  organizational  or initial offering costs still  outstanding to the
Adviser as of that date.  Through  September 30, 2004, the Adviser has requested
repayment of $284,671 of such expenses.  The Adviser agreed to forego $71,661 of
reimbursement of deferred expenses through September 30, 2004.







                                                                              10

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)



3.   MANAGEMENT FEE AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION

Pursuant to a management  agreement between the Fund and Adviser, the Adviser is
entitled to a management fee, paid monthly in arrears equal to an annual rate of
1.0% of the  members'  ending  monthly  capital of the Fund  before  taking into
consideration  management fees. Pursuant to the terms of a subadvisory agreement
between the Adviser and Subadviser, the Adviser pays a portion of the management
fee that it receives  from the Fund to the  Subadviser.  The  Subadviser is also
reimbursed by the Fund for  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the  Subadviser
related to the Fund, up to an annual limit of $25,000.

An incentive  allocation is calculated with respect to each Investor on the last
business  day of a calendar  year and upon  repurchase  of all or any portion of
such Investor's Interest (an "Incentive  Period").  An Incentive Period for each
Investor's Interest starts immediately  following the preceding Incentive Period
and ends on the first to occur of: (i) the next occurring last business day of a
calendar year; (ii) the next repurchase of all or any portion of such Investor's
Interest;  (iii) the withdrawal of the Adviser or Subadviser in connection  with
such party  ceasing to serve as Adviser or  Subadviser  to the Fund; or (iv) the
dissolution  of the Fund.  The aggregate  incentive  allocation  (to the Special
Members) for an Incentive Period equals 10% of the amount,  if any, in excess of
(a) profit net of losses  (after  taking into account  expenses,  including  the
management fee paid by the Fund)  allocated to each  Investor's  capital account
for such Incentive Period over (b) the greater of (i) the Investor's Hurdle Rate
Amount for that  Incentive  Period and (ii) the balance in the  Investor's  Loss
Carryforward as of the end of the prior Incentive  Period.  An Investor's  "Loss
Carryforward"  for the initial  Incentive  Period is zero and for each Incentive
Period  thereafter is equal to the Investor's Loss Carryforward as of the end of
the immediately  preceding  Incentive  Period,  increased or decreased,  but not
below zero, by the positive or negative  difference  between the net losses over
net profits  allocated  to the Investor for the current  Incentive  Period.  The
"Hurdle Rate Amount" is the return an Investor  would receive if its Interest as
of the  beginning  of that  Incentive  Period  (adjusted  appropriately  for any
additional  contributions)  earned a rate of return equal to the  one-year  U.S.
Treasury note, as determined on the first day of each calendar quarter and reset
on the  first  day of each  calendar  quarter.  The  Hurdle  Rate  Amount is not
cumulative from Incentive Period to Incentive Period. The Hurdle Rate Amount for
March 31, 2004,  June 30, 2004,  and  September  30, 2004 is 1.195%,  1.189% and
2.008% per annum,  respectively.  The incentive  allocation that would have been
allocated to the Special Members if September 30, 2004 were a calendar  year-end
is $214,405.




                                                                              11

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)



3.   MANAGEMENT FEE AND INCENTIVE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

In the case of a repurchase  of only a portion of an Interest  other than on the
last  business day of the calendar  year,  the Investor is treated as having two
independent  Interests  in the Fund,  one of which is being  repurchased  in its
entirety.  Allocations  to the  Investor and capital  contributions  made by the
Investor during the Incentive  Period prior to such repurchase or  distribution,
and the Investor's  opening capital account balance and Loss  Carryforward as of
the  beginning  of such  Incentive  Period,  will be  allocated  between the two
Interests  in  proportion  to the  portion of the  Investor's  Interest  that is
repurchased or distributed.  On June 30, 2004, the Special  Members  received an
incentive allocation of $2,271 related to such repurchases of Interests.

4.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

Each director who is not an  "interested  person" of the Fund, as defined by the
1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee of $1,250 for each
meeting attended. Any director or officer who is an "interested person" does not
receive any annual fee or other fees from the Fund. All directors are reimbursed
by the Fund for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of The PNC Financial  Services Group) serves as
custodian  of the Fund's  assets and provides  custodial  services for the Fund.
PFPC Inc.  (also an affiliate of The PNC  Financial  Services  Group)  serves as
administrator  and  accounting  agent to the Fund and in that capacity  provides
certain accounting,  record keeping, tax and investor related services. The Fund
pays a monthly fee to the custodian and the  administrator  based primarily upon
month-end members' capital, subject to a monthly minimum fee.

5.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL

As of the last day of each  calendar  month,  the Fund  allocates net profits or
losses for that month to the capital accounts of all Investors, in proportion to
their respective  opening capital account balances for such period (after taking
into account any capital  contributions deemed to be made as of the first day of
such period).

Net  profits or net losses for a given  fiscal  period are  measured  by the net
change in the value of the  members'  capital  of the  Fund,  including  any net
change in unrealized  appreciation  or  depreciation  of  investments,  realized
income,  gains or losses and accrued expenses (including the management fee paid
by the Fund) over such fiscal period, before


                                                                              12

5.   MEMBERS' CAPITAL (CONTINUED)

giving effect to any  distributions  and  repurchases  of Interests (or portions
thereof) by the Fund as of the end of such period and any capital  contributions
made at the end of such period (such  capital  contributions  being deemed to be
made as of the next day).

Interests  are offered  monthly.  The minimum  initial  investment  is $150,000,
although the Fund (or its designated agent) may waive this minimum. The Fund may
from time to time offer to repurchase  outstanding Interests based on the Fund's
members' capital pursuant to written tenders from Investors.  These  repurchases
are made at such times and on such terms as may be determined  by the Board,  in
its complete and exclusive discretion.  The Board authorized the Fund to conduct
a $25,000,000  tender offer  effective  June 30, 2004. As of September 30, 2004,
$141,668 of cash was on deposit in a  segregated  account  for final  payment of
those interests tendered. In addition,  the Board authorized the Fund to conduct
a $30,000,000  tender offer  effective  December 31, 2004. The December 31, 2004
tender  offer  expired  at  midnight  on  October  24,  2004 with  approximately
$6,276,637 in Interests being tendered.


6.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK,
     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS

In the normal course of business,  the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with  off-balance  sheet risk.  These  include,  but are not  limited to,  short
selling  activities,  writing option contracts,  and equity swaps. To the extent
that the  Fund's  investment  activity  is  limited  to  making  investments  in
investment funds via limited partnership  interests or limited liability company
holdings, the Fund's risk of loss in these investment funds is generally limited
to the value of these  investments  reported by the Fund. To date,  the Fund had
only invested in such limited partnership and limited liability interests.

Because the Fund is a closed-end  investment company,  its Interests will not be
redeemable at the option of Investors and will not be exchangeable for interests
of any other fund.  Although the Board in its  discretion  may cause the Fund to
offer  from  time to time to  repurchase  Interests  at their  members'  capital
account value, the Interests are  considerably  less liquid than shares of funds
that trade on a stock exchange or shares of open-end investment companies.  With
respect to any tender offer for Interests by the Fund, the aggregate  repurchase
amount will be determined  by the Board in its  discretion  and such  repurchase
amount may represent only a small portion of the Fund's  outstanding  Interests.
Because the Fund's investments in Portfolio Funds themselves have limited


                                                                              13

     CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK, AND OTHER RISKS (CONTINUED)

liquidity, the Fund may not be able to fund significant  repurchases.  Investors
whose  Interests are accepted for repurchase  also bear the risk that the Fund's
members' capital may fluctuate  significantly  between the time that they submit
their request for repurchase and the date of the repurchase.

There are a number of other  risks to the Fund.  Three  principal  types of risk
that can  adversely  affect  the Fund's  investment  approach  are market  risk,
strategy risk,  and manager risk.  The Fund also is subject to multiple  manager
risks,  possible  limitations  in investment  opportunities,  allocation  risks,
illiquidity,  lack  of  diversification,  and  other  risks  for  the  Fund  and
potentially for each Portfolio Fund.

In the normal course of business,  the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations and warranties and which provide general indemnities.
The Fund's maximum exposure under these  arrangements is unknown,  as this would
involve  future  claims  against the Fund that have not yet  occurred.  However,
based on experience,  the Fund expects the risk of loss due to these  warranties
and indemnities to be minimal.

7.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS

The agreements  related to investments in Portfolio Funds typically  provide for
compensation to the general  partners/managers in the form of management fees of
1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance/incentive fees or allocations
of up to 20% of net profits earned.  The Portfolio  Funds generally  provide for
periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to annually with lock up provisions of
up to one  year  from  initial  investment.  Some  Portfolio  Funds  may  charge
redemption  fees.  Such provisions may restrict the Fund's ability to respond to
changing  market  conditions.  None of the  Portfolio  Funds is expected to make
distributions (e.g., dividend payments to investors).

Aggregate  purchases of Portfolio  Funds for the six months ended  September 30,
2004  amounted to  $45,668,060,  including  $5,100,000 in purchases of Portfolio
Funds paid in advance of Portfolio  Fund openings.  Portfolio  Fund  investments
sold during the six months ended September 30, 2004 amounted to $4,518,060.

7.   INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO FUNDS (CONTINUED)

The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for items of
taxable income allocated to the Fund from the Portfolio Funds at the end of each
calendar year,  when the Portfolio  Funds report taxable income to the Fund. For
the calendar  year 2003,  $890,115 of taxable  income was  allocated to the Fund
from Portfolio Funds.

At September 30, 2004, the Adviser and Subadviser are unaware of any significant
issuer concentrations in the underlying Portfolio Funds.

8.   CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER EVENTS

On  September 3, 2003,  the Office of the Attorney  General for the State of New
York  ("NYAG")  simultaneously  filed and  settled a  complaint  against  Canary
Capital Partners, LLC, et al. (collectively,  "Canary").  The complaint alleged,
among other things,  that Canary  engaged in improper  trading in various mutual
funds  including  certain  Nations  Funds.  Specifically,  the NYAG alleged that
Canary engaged in activities that it  characterized as "market timing" and "late
trading." The NYAG later  announced a criminal  action,  and the SEC announced a
civil action,  against a former employee of Banc of America  Securities,  LLC, a
selling agent  affiliated with the Nations Funds'  distributor  and adviser.  In
connection with these events,  various  lawsuits have been filed,  some of which
name the Funds, among others, as defendants (see CIVIL LITIGATION below).

The  independent  Trustees of the Nations Funds have engaged  independent  legal
counsel and,  through them,  accountants  to evaluate the extent of any monetary
impact to any Funds from  discretionary  market timing or from late trading.  On
September 8, 2003, Bank of America Corporation and the Boards of Trustees of the
Nations Funds (the "Boards")  jointly announced that: (i) to the extent that the
independent  counsel  and  accountants  determine  that the  Nations  Funds were
adversely  affected  by any late  trading  or any  discretionary  market  timing
agreement,  BACAP would make appropriate  restitution;  and (ii) BACAP and BACAP
Distributors would promptly return to the Nations Funds that were the subject of
a market timing agreement all advisory and administration  fees they received as
a result of such an  agreement,  irrespective  as to  whether or not there is an
independent   determination   of  any  negative   impact  to  any  Nations  Fund
shareholders.  In addition,  Bank of America Corporation has also agreed to make
appropriate  reimbursement  of costs incurred by the Nations Funds in connection
with this matter.


                                                                              15

8.   CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER EVENTS (CONTINUED)

SETTLEMENTS IN PRINCIPLE WITH REGULATORS

On March  15,  2004,  Bank of  America  Corporation  and  FleetBoston  Financial
Corporation  ("Fleet") entered into agreements in principle (each an "Agreement"
and together,  the "Agreements")  with the NYAG and the SEC over matters related
to improper late trading and market timing of mutual funds.  As noted below,  on
April 1, 2004, Bank of America Corporation acquired Fleet.

Under the Agreements, Bank of America Corporation has agreed to pay $250 million
in  total  disgorgement  and  restitution  and a  penalty  of $125  million  and
FleetBoston   Financial   Corporation   agreed  to  pay  $70  million  in  total
disgorgement  and  restitution  and a penalty of $70 million.  In addition,  the
Agreement  with the NYAG requires an aggregate  reduction in mutual fund fees of
$32 million per year for five years across  selected  non-money  market funds in
the Nations Funds and Fleet mutual fund  complexes.  The final amount payable as
restitution and whether such restitution  will be effectuated  through a Nations
Fund or directly to shareholders, has not yet been determined.

When finalized,  the Agreements will conclude the  investigation by the NYAG and
the SEC of Bank of  America  Corporation  and its  affiliates  relating  to late
trading and market  timing  activities,  provided that the NYAG and the SEC have
reserved the right to continue their  respective  investigations  of and actions
against individuals.

BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION ACQUISITION OF FLEET

On April 1, 2004,  Bank of America  Corporation  acquired  Fleet. As a result of
this acquisition,  Columbia Management Advisors, Inc. ("CMA") and Columbia Funds
Distributor, Inc. ("CFDI") are now indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Bank of
America  Corporation.  The SEC and NYAG filed  proceedings  against both CMA and
CFDI on February 24, 2004 alleging that they had violated certain  provisions of
the federal  securities laws in connection with trading activity in mutual funds
shares and violated certain New York anti-fraud statutes.

In order to settle these matters,  as noted above,  Fleet entered into the March
15, 2004 Agreements with the NYAG and the SEC. In addition, both Bank of America
and Fleet committed to use best efforts to implement certain enhanced governance
and compliance procedures with respect to advised mutual funds and agreed to the
retention of  independent  consultants to review  compliance,  control and other
policies  and  procedures  relating to their  respective  mutual  fund  advisory
businesses.


                                                                              16

              Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued)



8.   CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER EVENTS (CONTINUED)

If either CMA or CFDI is ultimately  unsuccessful  in its defense of, or efforts
to procure a final settlement of, the February 24, 2004  proceedings,  or if any
final  settlement  includes an injunction  against CMA or CFDI  prohibiting them
from engaging in certain conduct, CMA, CFDI or any company that is an affiliated
person of CMA and CFDI could be barred from serving as an investment  adviser or
distributor for any investment  company  registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. If either CMA or CFDI is ultimately unsuccessful in its defense of,
or efforts to procure a final settlement of, the February 24, 2004  proceedings,
it is expected that they would seek exemptive relief from the SEC to permit them
to continue serving as the investment adviser and distributor of the fund.

CIVIL LITIGATION

In connection  with the events  described in detail above,  various parties have
filed suit against  certain  Nations Funds,  their Boards and/or Bank of America
Corporation (and affiliated  entities).  These cases have been consolidated in a
multi-district  proceeding  and  transferred  to the Federal  District  Court in
Maryland.

These suits and certain regulatory investigations are ongoing.  Accordingly,  an
estimate of the financial  impact of this litigation on any fund, if any, cannot
currently be made.

9.   FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

The below ratios are  calculated by dividing total dollars of income or expenses
as  applicable  by the  average  of  total  monthly  members'  capital.  The net
investment  loss ratio does not include the incentive  allocation.  Total return
amounts are calculated by  geometrically  linking returns based on the change in
value during each accounting period. An individual member's return may vary from
these returns based on the timing of capital contributions and withdrawals.
