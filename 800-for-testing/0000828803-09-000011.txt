                            GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE(R)

                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management
                            groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that has

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the six months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund had cumulative
total returns of -12.61% based on market price and -1.90% based on net asset
value. The Fund underperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond
Index (GGBI), which had cumulative total returns of +5.03% in local currency
terms and +1.14% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period.(1) You can find the
Fund's long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 7.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

The period under review encompassed one of the most challenging periods in
decades for the global economy and financial markets. The series of economic and
financial shocks culminated in a systemic failure of U.S. financial institutions
and led to an intensified worldwide financial crisis. Rising uncertainty and
risk aversion negatively impacted global capital flows with severe effects for
global demand and trade and contributed to a series of bank bailouts in the U.S.
and Europe. Global central banks reacted with aggressive interest rate
reductions, and in some cases, moved toward unconventional monetary easing
measures to increase liquidity by expanding central bank balance sheets.

The commodity price-driven inflation shock from early 2008 unwound as global
economic growth and asset prices deteriorated sharply. Lower inflation provided
central banks worldwide with significant scope for reducing interest rates.
During the period, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board (Fed) cut the federal funds
target rate 175 basis points (bps; 100 bps equal one percentage point) to 0.25%
and initiated an asset purchase program. While U.S. economic growth slowed in
the fourth quarter of 2008 at a -0.8% rate year-over-year, job shedding and
business spending retrenchment further weakened economic activity into 2009. The
unemployment rate rose from 6.2% to 8.1% over the six-month period.(2) Eurozone
economic activity weakened even more abruptly than in the U.S., contracting 1.2%
year-over-year in fourth quarter 2008, as deleveraging's impact on investment
activity contributed to a deepening recession.(3) The European Central Bank cut
interest rates 225 bps to 2.00% in the six-month period and significantly
stepped up liquidity operations to aid the

banking sector. In Asia, the Bank of Japan cut interest rates 40 bps to 0.10%,
and the central bank of China cut 216 bps to 5.31%. Although Asia's economic
growth slowed during the period, hampered by declining global trade, it was
notably less severe than in the U.S. or Europe. For instance, China registered
6.8% economic growth year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2008.(4) The
world's largest economies also complemented central bank measures with large
fiscal stimulus packages to address the crisis. In particular, China proposed
fiscal measures for the next two years worth about 12% of 2009 gross domestic
product to cushion the declines in investment activity and labor demand.(5)

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency
exchange rates and credit risks.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

The global backdrop of weak economic growth, disinflation and monetary easing
was positive for developed global bond markets. However, increased risk aversion
accompanied this environment, negatively impacting government bond yields in
some non-developed markets. The Fund's performance during the six-month period
reflected this divergence in the government bond market as our overall interest
rate strategy contributed to the Fund's return but detracted from performance
relative to the JPM GGBI. Although the Fund held exposure to eurozone government
bonds, its underweighted position hampered performance relative to the JPM GGBI
as German long-term bond yields fell during the period. Additionally, our lack
of exposure to U.S. government bonds hurt the Fund as their long-term yields
also fell. We continued to find other global bond markets more attractive than
the U.S. given our assessment of prospects for economic recoupling of these
economies to translate into increased monetary easing. We began to see examples
of this in Chile and South Korea during the period under review. While the U.S.
cut interest rates 175 bps during the period, effectively reaching the limits of
using interest rates as a monetary tool, Chile cut 300 bps to 4.75% and South
Korea 325 bps to 2.00%. Other countries such as Mexico and Indonesia each cut 75
bps to

7.50% and 8.25%. Although our Chilean and South Korean interest rate exposures
benefited relative Fund performance, our exposures to Mexico and Indonesia
detracted. We used this period of heightened volatility and forced selling to
add to positions where we believed yields were dislocated from fundamentals.
Despite the weak global growth environment and significant financial sector
deleveraging that reduced inflation risk over the near term, we remained
cautious toward the U.S. government bond market. We considered it a less
attractive interest rate opportunity, and we remained concerned about the
magnitude of fiscal easing, monetary measures and unwinding of global imbalances
that could potentially reduce foreign participation in the U.S. market over the
medium term.

WHAT IS A CURRENT ACCOUNT?

A current account is that part of the balance of payments where all of one
country's international transactions in goods and services are recorded.

WHAT IS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?

Balance of payments is a record of all of a country's exports and imports of
goods and services, borrowing and lending with the rest of the world during a
particular time period. It helps a country evaluate its competitive strengths
and weaknesses and forecast the strength of its currency.

CURRENCY STRATEGY

Heightened uncertainty during the reporting period benefited the U.S. dollar,
which appreciated 13.15% against its major trading partners.(6) We viewed the
U.S. dollar's recent strength as largely due to the global deleveraging process,
which increased demand for the dollar, rather than fundamental U.S. economic
strength. Although the Fund benefited from its U.S. dollar position, we actively
managed the position and scaled down exposure to increase room for currencies
that weakened sharply and, in our assessment, overshot fundamental value. We
believed recent developments were not conducive to the U.S. dollar's longer-term
strength given the Fed's aggressive money supply expansion, the largest planned
fiscal deficits since World War II, the trend toward nationalizing many U.S.
financial institutions, and foreigners' decreased interest in holding as many
U.S. assets as they had in the past. Although recent fiscal and monetary actions
prevented a collapse of the U.S. banking system and are crucial policy steps in
dealing with the crisis, we believed they could have longer-term consequences
such as higher taxes, lower growth, potential longer-term inflationary risks and
a weaker U.S. dollar.

Although a recessionary environment and financial distress were broadly felt
across most countries, we sought to position the Fund for relative instead of
absolute conditions as drivers of currency valuations. As a result, we
positioned for Asian currencies' appreciation against those of highly leveraged
developed countries that may have benefited from increased risk aversion but
whose fundamentals were weak, specifically the U.S. dollar and the euro. Asian
economic growth slowed, but less so than in the U.S. or Europe. We also believed
that Asia's more limited financial and economic vulnerabilities could support
currency performance over the medium term. The region has demonstrated its
ability to generate positive current account surpluses despite declining
exports. Additionally, Asian corporate and banking systems were less leveraged
going into this crisis, partly a legacy of the late 1990s' financial

crisis. Our strategy benefited performance relative to the JPM GGBI. For
example, the Chinese yuan rose 15.84% against the euro and the Malaysian ringgit
6.10%.(7) In addition to relative fundamentals, we held significant exposure to
the Japanese yen, which benefited from deleveraging and helped offset volatility
realized in other parts of the portfolio. During the six-month period, the
Japanese yen rose 28.57% against the euro and 10.92% against the U.S. dollar.(7)

The deepening European recession was complicated by the scale of leverage in the
banking and corporate sectors. Additionally, the European Monetary Union's
constraints limited policy response. Overall, the Fund benefited from its net
negative position in the euro, which declined 13.73% against the U.S. dollar.(7)
Exposure to other European currencies detracted, however, due to increased
concerns of a hard landing in eastern Europe given the region's dependence on
capital flows amid deleveraging. There was insufficient differentiation among
currencies during the period given vast fundamental differences among countries
across the region. Against the euro, the Polish zloty fell 28.70% and the
Swedish krona fell 17.24%.(7)

Other currencies that hampered Fund performance included the Brazilian real and
the Indonesian rupiah, which fell 31.25% and 23.62% against the U.S. dollar.(7)
Our currency hedging strategies on underlying bond positions helped protect the
Fund from downside risk to some degree. For example, the Fund largely avoided
the negative impact of the Mexican peso's 31.79% and South Korean won's 28.99%
depreciation against the U.S. dollar over the period.(7) We began to unwind
these currency hedges later in the reporting period after significant weakening
in the exchange rates, although we were exposed to some currency weakness in the
process.

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT AND CREDIT STRATEGY

In the credit sector, the Fund invested in emerging market sovereign debt and
U.S. municipal debt. These investments typically compensate for greater credit
risk by offering higher yields relative to U.S. and European benchmark treasury
yields.

U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt had a six-month return of -12.75%
as measured by the JPM Emerging Markets Bond Index Global (EMBIG).(8) Sovereign
interest rate spreads rose from 323 bps at the beginning of the reporting period
to 672 bps by period-end, as emerging market credit yields climbed sharply while
the U.S. Treasury yield curve shifted downward due to Fed rate cuts.(8) The Fund
held limited exposure to sovereign

credit risk at the beginning of the reporting period and used market volatility
to build positions in high-quality, emerging market sovereign credit where we
believed default risk offered value because of increased uncertainty and forced
selling during this global deleveraging period. Several positions detracted from
relative performance as sovereign spreads continued to widen as we built
positions.

The financial market turbulence also negatively impacted U.S. municipal bond
yields during the period. Municipal bonds historically traded at yields near or
at a premium to U.S. government bond yields given the asset class's tax
advantage. By period-end, the Barclays Capital (BC) Municipal Bond Index yielded
125 bps over U.S. 10-year Treasury bond yields.9 Spread widening in the period
reflected increased investor concern over municipal governments' access to
financing. We sought to take advantage of the dislocation in municipal bond
valuations relative to fundamentals, particularly given prospects for higher
taxes. Fund exposure to this sector contributed positively to performance
relative to the index for the period.

Thank you for your continued participation in Templeton Global Income Fund. We
look forward to serving your future investment needs.

Sincerely,

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (Fund) is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a closed-end investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed on a securities exchange or on the NASDAQ National Market
System are valued at the last quoted sale price or the official closing price of
the day, respectively. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities for
which there is no reported sale are valued within the range of the most recent
quoted bid and ask prices. Securities that trade in multiple markets or on
multiple exchanges are valued according to the broadest and most representative
market. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the closing net asset
value.

Corporate debt securities and government securities generally trade in the
over-the-counter market rather than on a securities exchange. The Fund may
utilize independent pricing services, quotations from bond dealers, and
information with respect to bond and note transactions, to assist in determining
a current market value for each security. The Fund's pricing services may use
valuation models or matrix pricing which considers information with respect to
comparable bond and note transactions, quotations from bond dealers, or by
reference to other securities that are considered comparable in such
characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date, option adjusted
spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and yield curves,
to determine current value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar
securities, or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions
on the disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of
valuations of such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the
values that would have been used had a ready market for such investments
existed. Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a
security is completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question
the availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio
security held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued
using fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS

When the Fund purchases or sells foreign securities it may enter into foreign
exchange contracts to minimize foreign exchange risk from the trade date to the
settlement date of the transactions. A foreign exchange contract is an agreement
between two parties to exchange different currencies at an agreed upon exchange
rate at a future date. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these
contracts are included in the Statement of Operations.

The Fund may also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. These contracts are valued daily by the Fund and the unrealized
appreciation or depreciation on the contracts, as measured by the difference
between the contractual forward foreign exchange rates and the forward rates at
the reporting date, are included in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are included in the
Statement of Operations.

The risks of these contracts include movement in the values of the foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the possible inability of the
counterparties to fulfill their obligations under the contracts, which may be in
excess of the amount reflected in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

D. INTEREST RATE SWAPS

The Fund may enter into interest rate swap contracts to hedge the risk of
changes in interest rates. Interest rate swaps are agreements between two
parties to exchange cash flows based on a notional principal amount. The
interest receivable or payable is recorded as unrealized appreciation or
depreciation in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Payments received or
made are recorded as realized gains or losses in the Statement of Operations.
Interest rate swaps are marked to market daily based upon quotations from the
market makers and the change, if any, is recorded as unrealized appreciation or
depreciation in the Statement of Operations. When the swap contract is
terminated early, the Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to the
difference between the current realized value and the expected cash flows. The
risks of interest rate swaps include changes in the market conditions and the
possible inability of the counterparty to fulfill its obligations under the
agreement.

E. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years and as of February 28, 2009, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

F. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These differences
may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among
capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no
impact on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

F. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS
(CONTINUED)

Inflation-indexed bonds provide an inflation hedge through periodic increases or
decreases in the security's interest accruals and principal redemption value, by
amounts corresponding to the current rate of inflation. Any such adjustments,
including adjustments to principal redemption value, are recorded as interest
income.

G. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

H. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At February 28, 2009, there were an unlimited number of shares authorized
(without par value). During the period ended February 28, 2009 there were no
shares issued; all reinvested distributions were satisfied with previously
issued shares purchased in the open market. Transactions in the Fund's shares
were as follows:

The Fund's Board of Trustees previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. Through February 28, 2009, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares. During the periods ended February 28,
2009 and August 31, 2008, there were no shares repurchased.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

10. CREDIT RISK

The Fund has 19.28% of its portfolio invested in high yield, senior secured
floating rate notes, or other securities rated below investment grade. These
securities may be more sensitive to economic conditions causing greater price
volatility and are potentially subject to a greater risk of loss due to default
than higher rated securities.

11. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Fund adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157), on September 1, 2008.
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Fund has determined
that the implementation of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Fund's
financial statements.

SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market
data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Fund's own
market assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining
the value of the Fund's investments and are summarized in the following fair
value hierarchy:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk,
          etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.

</TABLE>

(a)  Other financial instruments includes net unrealized appreciation
     (depreciation) on forward exchange contracts and swaps.

13. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In March 2008, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133"
(SFAS 161), which expands disclosures about derivative investments and hedging
activities. SFAS 161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning
after November 15, 2008. The Fund believes applying the various provisions of
SFAS 161 will not have a material impact on its financial statements.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan. If you decide
to use this service, share dividends and capital gains distributions will be
reinvested automatically in shares of the Fund for your account. BNY Mellon
Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8035, will provide
additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in shares at a price equal
to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market price
of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or if
dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
shall be made by check or money order payable to The Bank of New York Mellon and
sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 382009, Pittsburgh, PA,
15252-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The Plan Administrator will
apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and less a pro rata share of
trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fee for a sale of shares through the Plan is $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

A participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written
notice to the Plan Administrator sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P. O.
Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8035. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds to the
participant, less a service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per
share.

DIRECT DEPOSIT SERVICE FOR REGISTERED SHAREHOLDERS

Cash distributions can now be electronically credited to a checking or savings
account at any financial institution that participates in the Automated Clearing
House ("ACH") system. The Direct Deposit service is provided for registered

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies. The manager votes proxies solely in the interests
of the Fund and its shareholders.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of policy, the
officers, directors/trustees and employees of the manager and the Proxy Group
will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with the
interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve all
conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client,
distributor, broker dealer and vendor lists, information periodically gathered
from directors and officers, and information derived from other sources,
including public filings. In situations where a material conflict of interest is
identified, the Proxy Group may defer to the voting recommendation of
RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third party provider of
proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund with the manager's
recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If the conflict is not resolved
by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter, along with the recommended
course of action by the manager, if any, to an interdepartmental Proxy Review
Committee (which may include portfolio managers and/or research analysts
employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy
Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass
Lewis or those of another independent third party provider of proxy services; or
send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group or the Proxy Review
Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the instructions of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board of directors or a committee of the
board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on any one of Sections 12(d)(1)(E), (F), or (G) of
the 1940 Act, or pursuant to an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests
uninvested cash in affiliated money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive
order ("cash sweep arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's
governing documents or applicable law. Echo voting means that the investment
manager will vote the shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the
other holders of the Fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor that the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted. However, the manager does
not consider recommendations from management to be determinative of the
manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with respect to
most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager will consider
withholding votes from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings
without a valid reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO
positions, the manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or
provide for cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration
factors such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. The manager will closely
scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the
manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit
fees. The manager will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to
rotate auditors, and will vote against the ratification of auditors when there
is clear and compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with the shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. However, as
with all proxy issues, the manager conducts an independent review of each
anti-takeover proposal. On occasion, the manager may vote with management when
the research analyst has concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would
not harm the Fund or its shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports
proposals that require shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject
to a shareholder vote and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case
basis to determine whether or not they warrant support. In addition, the manager
will generally vote against any proposal to issue stock that has unequal or
subordinate voting rights. The manager generally opposes any supermajority
voting requirements as well as the payment of "greenmail." The manager generally
supports "fair price" provisions and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager realizes that a company's financing
decisions have a significant impact on its shareholders, particularly when they
involve the issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock or the
assumption of additional debt. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase. The manager will generally not vote in favor of dual-class capital
structures to increase the number of authorized shares where that class of stock
would have superior voting rights. The manager will generally vote in favor of
the issuance of preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting,
dividend, conversion and other rights of such stock and the terms of the
preferred stock issuance are deemed reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether they would be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring proposals are also subject to a thorough examination on
a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
the manager's proxy voting decisions for international investments. However, the
manager must be flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied
market practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised March 06, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.


II.  Other Policies and Procedures

        This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

        Franklin Resources, Inc. has separately adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS CONDUCT ("Business Conduct"), which is applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It summarizes the values, principles and business practices that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers, directors and employees regarding the minimum ethical requirements
expected of them. It supplements the values, principles and business conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

        Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal
securities trading and other related matters. The Code for Insider Trading
provides for separate requirements that apply to the Covered Officers and
others, and therefore is not part of this Code.

        Insofar as other policies or procedures of Franklin Resources, Inc.,
the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter, or other service providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the Covered Officers
who are subject to this Code, they are superceded by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of this Code. Please review
these other documents or consult with the Legal Department if have questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.


III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

        OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's
private interest interferes with the interests of, or his or her service to, the
FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,
or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

        Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

         Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

        Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

I hereby acknowledge receipt of a copy of Franklin Templeton Fund's code of
ethics for Principal Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers (the

1. Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2. Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

3. Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4. Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.
