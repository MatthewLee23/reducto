George Putnam, III

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

Over the past year, Putnam has introduced a number of reforms for the
benefit of shareholders, including increasing the amount of disclosure
for our funds. We are now including additional disclosure about your
fund's management teams. Following the Outlook for Your Fund, we provide
manager compensation information that pertains to your fund, list any
changes in your fund's Portfolio Leader and Portfolio Members during the
prior year, and disclose these individuals' other fund management
responsibilities at Putnam. We also show how much these individuals, as
well as the members of Putnam's Executive Board, have invested in the
fund (in dollar ranges). Finally, on page 12, we provide certain
information about the most recent approval by the Trustees of your
fund's management contract with Putnam.

During the reporting period just ended, the Federal Reserve Board's
series of gradual increases in the federal funds rate have occupied much
of investors' attention, but generally did not have a significant impact
on stock and bond prices. However, over the last two months, we have
begun to see a measurable increase in longer-term rates. This, along
with the continued high levels of energy prices, has slowed the stock
market's momentum even though the U.S. economy is continuing to expand
at a moderate pace. Concerns about inflation, dormant for many months,
are beginning to influence the markets once again and may well have a
negative impact on bond prices.

In the following pages, members of your fund's management teams discuss
the fund's performance, the strategies used to keep your fund on track
during the reporting period, and the team's plan for responding to the
changing market environment.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                  George Putnam, III
Chairman of the Trustees      President of the Funds

Data is historical. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
More recent returns may be less or more than those shown. Investment
return, net asset value, and market price will fluctuate and you may
have a gain or a loss when you sell your shares. Performance assumes
reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.

Performance commentary

We are pleased to report that your fund posted solid returns during the
period and outpaced both its primary and secondary benchmarks, based on
results at NAV. We attribute this to effective security selection and
generally favorable market conditions. Strong performance from
convertible holdings and the fund's significant allocation to high-yield
corporate bonds helped it rank competitively in its Lipper peer group;
however, the fund slightly underperformed the average return for the
group, which currently includes only 12 funds. It is important to note
that a fund's performance at market price may differ from its results at
NAV. Although market price performance generally reflects investment
results, it may also be influenced by several other factors, including
changes in investor perceptions of the fund or its investment advisor,
market conditions, fluctuations in supply and demand for the fund's
shares, and changes in fund distributions.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam High Income Bond Fund seeks to provide high current income by
investing in a portfolio of high-yielding convertible and nonconvertible
securities with potential for capital appreciation. The fund invests,
under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets in bonds
rated below investment grade.


Market overview

Over the past six months, market sentiment shifted between caution and
exhilaration. From September 1 through November's U.S. presidential
election, the market reflected investors' uncertainty. The Federal
Reserve Board (the Fed) had begun periodically raising short-term
interest rates starting in June 2004. Despite rising rates, bond sales
were strong, signaling investors' high level of risk aversion. The
possibility of a terrorist incident or voting irregularities weighed on
investors' minds in the weeks before Election Day. Sustained high oil
prices were an additional cause for concern. However, after voters
handed George W. Bush a decisive victory, relieved investors sought more
speculative opportunities. The stock market rallied and posted strong
gains through the end of the calendar year. The high-yield market,
moving in concert with equities, experienced seasonal strength at the
end of the calendar year and was further buoyed by increased
consolidation activity. Yield spreads -- the difference in yield between
higher- and lower-rated bonds of comparable maturities -- narrowed
significantly. When this is the case, high-yield bonds offer less of a
yield advantage over Treasury bonds of similar maturities.

Strategy overview

Because yield spreads have narrowed in recent months, and lower-rated
bonds now offer a less compelling yield advantage, investors in
high-yield and convertible bonds now receive less of a premium for the
additional risk they are taking. Consequently, our goal has been to
improve the quality of the portfolio while still targeting securities
that offer attractive yields.

For example, we emphasized mandatory convertible securities, which must
be converted, at a specified date, to common stocks. If the issuing
company pays its stockholders a dividend, then the yield on its
mandatory convertibles is generally two to three percentage points
higher than the stock dividend yield, in order to attract potential
investors. On these securities, the higher yield is not a reflection of
a weaker credit rating. Our emphasis on mandatory convertibles increased
both the quality and the equity sensitivity of the portfolio, a term
that indicates how likely the portfolio is to reflect stock market
trends.

We also established the fund's first position in non-accreting
zero-coupon convertibles, which are described more fully on page 4. We
don't typically invest in this type of security but when one of these
bonds became available in the secondary market at an attractive
discount, we viewed it as an opportunity worth pursuing.

Among the portfolio's high-yield bonds, we also trimmed some of the
lower-quality holdings, which had been strong performers. We reduced
positions in  wireless communications, chemicals, media companies, auto
suppliers, and  technology companies.

How fund holdings affected performance

Among the fund's convertible holdings, our position in Titan
International was a top contributor to relative performance during the
period. The company is the largest independent manufacturer of tires and
wheels for tractors and other off-road vehicles. The convertible bonds,
which we purchased at par value, have appreciated over 30% in the short
time the fund has owned them. We continue to hold this position. The
fund also established a position in the convertible preferred stock of
Huntsman Corporation, a chemical manufacturer that, until just recently,
had been privately owned. The value of these shares increased nearly 20%
since the company went public. We maintained the position.

As noted in the Strategy Overview section, we established a position in
a non-accreting, zero-coupon convertible. Unlike conventional zero
coupon bonds, which are issued at a discount and increase in value
through accretion (the accumulation of capital gains), these bonds are
issued at par value. They offer no interest income and can increase in
value only through their link to the underlying stock. The value of the
zero coupon convertible bonds issued by ON Semiconductor had declined in
response to weakening of the underlying common stock. Given our positive
assessment of the firm's credit rating, we believed these zero coupon
bonds were so undervalued that despite their lack of interest payments,
they offered an implied yield of more than 6%. By the end of the
reporting period, they had contributed positively to the fund's returns.

Footnote reads:
The fund's holdings will change over time.

The fund's positions in natural gas-related utilities also performed well,
as a result of strong and growing demand. Notable among these utilities were
Williams Companies, Aquila, ONEOK, and Southern Union. Among traditional oil
companies, the fund's Amerada-Hess holdings posted strong results, as oil
prices remained high. Bonds issued by Lyondell Chemical were standout
performers among the fund's high-yield holdings. This company had been
through some difficult years, as the costs of the raw materials used to
produce its products had risen, foreign competition had intensified, and
economic variables not in its control caused demand for its products to
fluctuate. Eventually, the improving economy helped chemical companies in
general. Lyondell was able to pass along higher energy costs to consumers,
which improved its financial performance.

A position in the high-yield bonds of Icon Health detracted from the
fund's results during the period. The company, which manufactures
exercise equipment for home gyms, faced rising materials costs and was
not able to pass these costs on to consumers. We believe this situation
is likely to be temporary and we continue to hold the position. Star Gas
Partners, LP was another detractor during the period. This distributor
of home heating oil had not hedged against rising oil prices, and as a
result suffered when oil prices rose higher. The company also had some
service issues that led to a decline in its customer base. We think the
issues will be resolved and we continue to hold the position.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary in
the future.

OF SPECIAL INTEREST

Merger with Putnam High Income Opportunities Trust completed

On January 13, 2005, shareholders of your fund and Putnam High Income
Opportunities Trust approved a merger of Putnam High Income
Opportunities Trust into your fund, and the merger was completed on
January 21, 2005. Putnam High Income Opportunities Trust was a
closed-end, fixed income fund whose objectives, strategy, and
investments were substantially similar to those of your fund.


The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
teams' plans for responding to them.

We believe the fundamental backdrop remains favorable for high-yield
bonds and convertible bond investing. Default rates have been low, and
the strong economy has contributed to a healthy credit environment. In
our opinion, companies that exhibit poor credit ratings in this economy
probably have significant operational problems that we would choose to
avoid. However, at this point in the credit cycle, spreads have
tightened to such an extent that returns will likely be muted compared
to the strong results of 2004. We believe the opportunity to capitalize
on narrowing yield spreads has essentially passed. Because the economy
has matured, we are looking for select opportunities that offer high
yields without increased credit risk. Among convertibles, we will
continue to target securities and situations that offer a structurally
high yield, as we discussed in the Strategy Overview of this report. We
will seek to achieve higher-quality holdings and a greater degree of
equity sensitivity in the portfolio.

Within the convertible portion of the portfolio we will continue to seek
special opportunities, without emphasis on particular sectors, and
generally will seek to own about 70 issues. The high-yield portion of
the portfolio typically holds a larger number of issues and we actively
manage sector exposures in an effort to improve relative performance.

We remain committed to combining our strengths in fundamental and
quantitative research to uncover attractive opportunities within the
high-yield and convertible markets.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. Mutual funds that
invest in bonds are subject to certain risks, including interest-rate
risk, credit risk, and inflation risk. As interest rates rise, the
prices of bonds fall. Long-term bonds are more exposed to interest-rate
risk than short-term bonds. Unlike bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees
and expenses. Lower-rated bonds may offer higher yields in return for
more risk.

Fund manager compensation

The total 2004 fund manager compensation that is attributable to your fund
is approximately $600,000. This amount includes a portion of 2004
compensation paid by Putnam Management to the fund managers listed in this
section for their portfolio management responsibilities, calculated based on
the fund assets they manage taken as a percentage of the total assets they
manage. The compensation amount also includes a portion of the 2004
compensation paid to the Group Chief Investment Officers of the fund's
broader investment categories for their oversight responsibilities,
calculated based on the fund assets they oversee taken as a percentage of
the total assets they oversee. These percentages are determined as of the
fund's fiscal period-end. For personnel who joined Putnam Management during
or after 2004, the calculation reflects annualized 2004 compensation or an
estimate of 2005 compensation, as applicable.

Terms and definitions

Total return shows how the value of the fund's shares changed over time,
assuming you held the shares through the entire period and reinvested all
distributions in the fund.

Net asset value (NAV) is the value of all your fund's assets, minus any
liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding shares.

Market price is the current trading price of one share of the fund. Market
prices are set by transactions between buyers and sellers on exchanges such
as the American Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.

Trustee approval of management contract

General conclusions

The Board of Trustees of the Putnam funds oversees the management of each
fund and, as required by law, determines annually whether to approve the
continuance of each fund's management contract with Putnam Management. In
this regard the Board of Trustees, with the assistance of its Contract
Committee consisting solely of Independent Trustees, requests and evaluates
all information it deems reasonably necessary in the circumstances. Over the
course of several months beginning in March and ending in June of 2004, the
Contract Committee reviewed the information provided by Putnam Management
and other information developed with the assistance of the Board's
independent counsel and independent staff. The Contract Committee reviewed
and discussed key aspects of this information with all of the Independent
Trustees. Upon completion of this review, the Contract Committee recommended
and the Independent Trustees approved the continuance of your fund's
contract, effective July 1, 2004.

This approval was based on the following conclusions:

* That the fee schedule currently in effect for your fund represents
  reasonable compensation in light of the nature and quality of the
  services being provided to the fund, the fees paid by competitive funds
  and the costs incurred by Putnam Management in providing such service,
  and

* That such fee schedule represents an appropriate sharing between fund
  shareholders and Putnam Management of such economies of scale as may
  exist in the management of the fund at current asset levels.

These conclusions were based on a comprehensive consideration of all
information provided to the Trustees and were not the result of any
single factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the
Trustees' deliberations are described below.

Model fee schedules and categories; total expenses

The Trustees, working in cooperation with Putnam Management, have developed
and implemented a series of model fee schedules for the Putnam funds
designed to ensure that each fund's management fee is consistent with the
fees for similar funds in the Putnam complex and compares favorably with
fees paid by competitive funds sponsored by other advisors. The Trustees
reviewed the model fee schedule currently in effect for the fund, including
fee levels and breakpoints, and the assignment of the fund to a particular
fee category under this structure. The Trustees also reviewed comparative
fee and expense information for competitive funds. The Trustees concluded
that no changes should be made in the fund's current fee schedule at this
time. The Trustees noted that expense ratios for a number of Putnam funds
had been increasing recently as a result of declining net assets and the
natural operation of fee breakpoints. They noted that such expense ratio
increases were currently being controlled by expense limitations implemented
in January 2004. They also noted that the competitive landscape regarding
mutual fund fees may be changing as a result of fee reductions accepted by
various other fund groups in connection with recent regulatory settlements
and greater focus on fees and expenses in the mutual fund industry
generally. The Trustees indicated an intention to monitor these developments
closely.

Economies of scale

As noted above, the Trustees concluded that the fee schedule currently
in effect for your fund represents an appropriate sharing of economies
of scale at current asset levels. The Trustees indicated their intention
to continue their ongoing consideration of economies of scale and in
particular to consider further the possible operation of such economies
in the event that a significant recovery in the equity markets or net
fund sales were to raise asset levels substantially above current
levels. In this regard, the Trustees noted that they had reviewed data
relating to the substantial increase in asset levels of the Putnam funds
that occurred during the years leading up to the market peak in 2000,
the subsequent decline in assets and the resulting impact on revenues
and expenses of Putnam Management. The Trustees also noted that recent
declines in net assets in many Putnam funds, together with significant
changes in the cost structure of Putnam Management have altered the
economics of Putnam Management's business in significant ways. The
Trustees concluded that they would monitor these changes carefully and
evaluate the resulting impact on Putnam Management's economics and the
sharing of economies of scale between the parties.

Investment performance

The quality of the investment process provided by Putnam Management
represented a major factor in the Trustees' evaluation of the quality of
services provided by Putnam Management under the Management Contracts.
The Trustees recognized that a high quality investment process -- as
measured by the experience and skills of the individuals assigned to the
management of fund portfolios, the resources made available to such
personnel, and in general the ability of Putnam Management to attract
and retain high-quality personnel -- does not guarantee favorable
investment results for every fund in every time period. The Trustees
considered the investment performance of each fund over multiple time
periods and considered information comparing the fund's performance with
various benchmarks and with the performance of competitive funds. The
Trustees noted the satisfactory investment performance of many Putnam
funds.

They also noted the disappointing investment performance of certain
funds in recent years and continued to discuss with senior management of
Putnam Management the factors contributing to such under-performance and
actions being taken to improve performance. The Trustees recognized
that, in recent years, Putnam Management has made significant changes in
its investment personnel and processes and in the fund product line in
an effort to address areas of underperformance. The Trustees indicated
their intention to continue to monitor performance trends to assess the
effectiveness of these changes and to evaluate whether additional
remedial changes are warranted. As a general matter, the Trustees
concluded that consultation between the Trustees and Putnam Management
represents the most effective way to address investment performance
problems. The Trustees believe that investors in the Putnam funds and
their financial advisors have, as a general matter, effectively placed
their trust in the Putnam organization, under the supervision of the
funds' Trustees, to make appropriate decisions regarding the management
of the funds. The Trustees believe that the termination of the
Management Contract and engagement of a new investment adviser for
under-performing funds, with all the attendant disruptions, would not
serve the interests of fund shareholders at this time and would not
necessarily provide any greater assurance of improved investment
performance.

Brokerage and soft-dollar allocations; other benefits

The Trustees considered various potential benefits that Putnam
Management may receive in connection with the services it provides under
the Management Contract with your fund. These include principally
benefits related to brokerage and soft-dollar allocations, which pertain
mainly to funds investing in equity securities. The Trustees believe
that soft-dollar credits and other potential benefits associated with
the allocation of fund brokerage represent assets of the funds that
should be used for the benefit of fund shareholders. The Trustees noted
recent trends in the allocation of fund brokerage, including commission
costs, the allocation of brokerage to firms that provide research
services to Putnam Management, and the sources and application of
available soft-dollar credits. Effective December 31, 2003, reflecting a
decision made by the Trustees earlier that year, Putnam Management
ceased allocating brokerage in connection with the sale of fund shares.
In addition, in preparing its budget for commission allocations in 2004,
Putnam Management voluntarily reduced substantially the allocation of
brokerage commissions to acquire research services from third-party
service providers. In light of evolving best practices in the mutual
fund industry, the Trustees concluded that this practice should be
further curtailed and possibly eliminated in the near future. The
Trustees indicated that they would continue to monitor the allocation of
the funds' brokerage to ensure that the principle of "best price and
execution" remains paramount in the portfolio trading process.

Comparison of retail and institutional fee schedules

The information examined by the Trustees as part of the annual contract
reviews included information regarding fees charged by Putnam Management and
its affiliates to institutional clients such as defined benefit pension
plans and college endowments. This information included comparison of such
fees with fees charged to the Putnam funds, as well as a detailed assessment
of the differences in the services provided to these two types of clients.
The Trustees devoted special attention to these issues and reviewed recent
articles by critics of mutual fund fees, articles by the ICI defending such
fee differences, and relevant guidance provided by decisions of the courts.
The Trustees observed, in this regard, that the differences in fee rates
between institutional clients and mutual funds are by no means uniform when
examined by individual asset sectors, suggesting that differences in the
pricing of investment management services to these types of clients reflects
to a substantial degree historical competitive forces operating in separate
market places. In reaching their conclusions, the Trustees considered the
fact that fee rates across all asset sectors are higher on average for
mutual funds than for institutional clients, and also considered the
differences between the services that Putnam provides to the Putnam funds
and those that it provides to institutional clients of the firm.

Settlement of regulatory charges related to market timing

Finally, in reaching their conclusions, the Trustees considered all
matters pertinent to the administrative charges filed against Putnam
Management by the SEC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in October
2003 relating to market timing, the firm's settlement of those charges,
and the conclusions and recommendations of the Trustees' Audit and
Pricing Committee based on its review of these matters. The Trustees
considered the actions taken by the owner of Putnam Management and its
new senior management to terminate or discipline the individuals
involved, to implement new compliance systems, to indemnify the funds
against all costs and liabilities related to these matters, and
otherwise to ensure that the interests of the funds and their
shareholders are fully protected. The Trustees noted that, in addition
to the settlements of the regulatory charges which will provide
comprehensive restitution for any losses suffered by shareholders, the
new senior management of Putnam Management has moved aggressively to
control expense ratios of funds affected by market timing, to reduce
charges to new investors, to improve disclosure of fees and expenses,
and to emphasize the paramount role of investment performance in
achieving shareholders' investment goals.


Other information for shareholders

A note about duplicate mailings

In response to investors' requests, the SEC has modified mailing
regulations for proxy statements, semiannual and annual reports, and
prospectuses. Putnam is now able to send a single copy of these
materials to customers who share the same address. This change will
automatically apply to all shareholders except those who notify us. If
you would prefer to receive your own copy, please call Putnam at
1-800-225-1581.

Proxy voting

Putnam is committed to managing our mutual funds in the best interests
of our shareholders. The Putnam funds' proxy voting guidelines and
procedures, as well as information regarding how your fund voted proxies
relating to portfolio securities during the 12-month period ended June
30, 2004, are available on the Putnam Individual Investor Web site,
www.putnaminvestments.com/individual, and on the SEC's Web site,
www.sec.gov. If you have questions about finding forms on the SEC's Web
site, you may call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You may also obtain the
Putnam funds' proxy voting guidelines and procedures at no charge by
calling Putnam's Shareholder Services at 1-800-225-1581.

Fund portfolio holdings

For periods ending on or after July 9, 2004, the fund will file a
complete schedule of its portfolio holdings with the SEC for the first
and third quarters of each fiscal year on Form N-Q. Shareholders may
obtain the fund's Forms N-Q on the SEC's Web site at www.sec.gov. In
addition, the fund's Forms N-Q may be reviewed and copied at the SEC's
public reference room in Washington, D.C. You may call the SEC at
1-800-SEC-0330 for information about the SEC's Web site or the operation
of the public reference room.


A guide to the financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,
constitute the fund's financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values
as of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by
asset type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of
concentration and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together. Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to
determine the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately
for each class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount
subtracted from total assets includes the net assets allocated to
remarketed preferred shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss.
This is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from
dividends and interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses
to determine net investment income (or loss). Then, any net gain or loss
the fund realized on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any
unrealized gains or losses over the period -- is added to or subtracted
from the net investment result to determine the fund's net gain or loss
for the fiscal period.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by the fund's net investment gain or loss, by distributions to
shareholders, and by changes in the number of the fund's shares. It
lists distributions and their sources (net investment income or realized
capital gains) over the current reporting period and the most recent
fiscal year-end. The distributions listed here may not match the sources
listed in the Statement of operations because the distributions are
determined on a tax basis and may be paid in a different period from the
one in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment
results, per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment
income ratios, and portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting
the five most recent reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the
highlight table also includes the current reporting period. For open-end
funds, a separate table is provided for each share class.

Notes to financial statements
February 28, 2005 (Unaudited)

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam High Income Bond Fund (the "fund"), a Massachusetts business
trust, is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company. The
fund seeks to provide high current income as a primary objective and
capital appreciation as a secondary objective by investing in a
portfolio primarily consisting of high-yielding convertible and
nonconvertible securities with the potential for capital appreciation.
The fund invests in higher yielding, lower rated bonds that have a
higher rate of default due to the nature of the fund's investments.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements.  The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Investments for which market quotations are
readily available are valued at the last reported sales price on their
principal exchange, or official closing price for certain markets. If no
sales are reported -- as in the case of some securities traded
over-the-counter -- a security is valued at its last reported bid price.
Market quotations are not considered to be readily available for certain
debt obligations; such investments are valued at fair value on the basis
of valuations furnished by an independent pricing service or dealers,
approved by the Trustees. Such services or dealers determine valuations
for normal institutional-size trading units of such securities using
methods based on market transactions for comparable securities and
various relationships, generally recognized by institutional traders,
between securities. Many securities markets and exchanges outside the
U.S. close prior to the close of the New York Stock Exchange and
therefore the closing prices for securities in such markets or on such
exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur after such close but
before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, on certain
days, the fund will fair value foreign securities taking into account
multiple factors, including movements in the U.S. securities markets.
The number of days on which fair value prices will be used will depend
on market activity and it is possible that fair value prices will be
used by the fund to a significant extent. Securities quoted in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange
rate. Short-term investments having remaining maturities of 60 days or
less are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. Other
investments, including certain restricted securities, are valued at fair
value following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and
procedures are reviewed  periodically by the Trustees.

B) Joint trading account Pursuant to an exemptive order from the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the fund may transfer
uninvested cash balances, including cash collateral received under
security lending arrange ments, into a joint trading account along with
the cash of other registered investment companies and certain other
accounts managed by Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam
Management"), the fund's manager, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Putnam, LLC. These balances may be invested in issues of high-grade
short-term investments having maturities of up to 397 days for
collateral received under security lending arrangements and up to 90
days for other cash investments.

C) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on the
identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income, net
of applicable withholding taxes, is recognized on the ex-dividend date
except that certain dividends from foreign  securities are recognized as
soon as the fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Non-cash
dividends, if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the
securities received.

All premiums/discounts are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity
basis.

D) Foreign currency translation The accounting records of the fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars. The market value of foreign securities,
currency holdings, and other assets and liabilities are recorded in the
books and records of the fund after translation to U.S. dollars based on
the exchange rates on that day. The cost of each security is determined
using historical exchange rates. Income and withholding taxes are
translated at prevailing exchange rates when earned or incurred. The
fund does not isolate that portion of realized or unrealized gains or
losses resulting from changes in the foreign exchange rate on
investments from fluctuations arising from changes in the market prices
of the securities. Such gains and losses are included with the net
realized and unrealized gain or loss on investments. Net realized gains
and losses on foreign currency transactions represent net realized
exchange gains or losses on closed forward currency contracts,
disposition of foreign currencies, currency gains and losses realized
between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions and
the difference between the amount of investment income and foreign
withholding taxes recorded on the fund's books and the U.S. dollar
equivalent amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized
appreciation and depreciation of assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies arise from changes in the value of open forward currency
contracts and assets and liabilities other than investments at the
period end, resulting from changes in the exchange rate. Investments in
foreign securities involve certain risks, including those related to
economic instability, unfavorable political developments, and currency
fluctuations, not present with domestic investments.

E) Forward currency contracts The fund may buy and sell forward currency
contracts, which are agreements between two parties to buy and sell
currencies at a set price on a future date. These contracts are used to
protect against a decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar of the
currencies in which its portfolio securities are denominated or quoted
(or an increase in the value of a currency in which securities a fund
intends to buy are denominated, when a fund holds cash reserves and
short term investments). The U.S. dollar value of forward currency
contracts is determined using current forward currency exchange rates
supplied by a quotation service. The market value of the contract will
fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates. The contract is
marked to market daily and the change in market value is recorded as an
unrealized gain or loss. When the contract is closed, the fund records a
realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. The fund could be exposed to risk if the value of the currency
changes unfavorably, if the counterparties to the contracts are unable
to meet the terms of their contracts or if the fund is unable to enter
into a closing position. Risks may exceed amounts recognized on the
statement of assets and liabilities. Forward currency contracts
outstanding at period end, if any, are listed after the fund's
portfolio.

F) Credit default contracts The fund may enter into credit default
contracts where one party, the protection buyer, makes an upfront or
periodic payment to a counter party, the protection seller, in exchange
for the right to receive a contingent payment. The maximum amount of the
payment may equal the notional amount, at par, of the underlying index
or security as a result of a related credit event. An upfront payment
received by the fund, as the protection seller, is recorded as a
liability on the fund's books. An upfront payment made by the fund, as
the protection buyer, is recorded as an asset on the fund's books.
Periodic payments received or paid by the fund are recorded as realized
gains or losses. The credit default contracts are marked to market
daily based upon quotations from market makers and the change, if any,
is recorded as unrealized gain or loss. Payments received or made as a
result of a credit event or termination of the contract are recognized,
net of a proportional amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains
or losses. In addition to bearing the risk that the credit event will
occur, the fund could be exposed to market risk due to unfavorable
changes in interest rates or in the price of the underlying security or
index, the possibility that the fund may be unable to close out its
position at the same time or at the same price as if it had purchased
comparable publicly traded securities or that the counterparty may
default on its obligation to perform. Risks of loss may exceed amounts
recognized on the statement of assets and liabilities. Credit default
contracts outstanding at period end, if any, are listed after the fund's
portfolio.

G) Security lending The fund may lend securities, through its agents, to
qualified borrowers in order to earn additional income. The loans are
collateralized by cash and/or securities in an amount at least equal to
the market value of the securities loaned. The market value of
securities loaned is determined daily and any additional required
collateral is allocated to the fund on the next business day. The risk
of borrower default will be borne by the fund's agents; the fund will
bear the risk of loss with respect to the investment of the cash
collateral. Income from securities lending is included in investment
income on the statement of operations. At February 28, 2005, the value
of securities loaned amounted to $7,265,954. The fund received cash
collateral of $7,484,215 which is pooled with collateral of other Putnam
funds into 33 issuers of high grade short-term investments.

H) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
taxable income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") applicable
to regulated investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund
to distribute an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax
under Section 4982 of the Code, as amended. Therefore, no provision has
been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or unrealized
appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income and capital
gains.

At August 31, 2004, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $19,335,434
available to the extent allowed by the Code to offset future net capital
gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover      Expiration
- ------------------------------------
      $535,162      August 31, 2009
     9,205,575      August 31, 2010
     9,594,697      August 31, 2011

As a result of the January 21, 2005 merger of Putnam High Income
Opportunities Trust into the fund, the fund acquired $21,216,278 in
capital loss carryovers which are subject to limitations imposed by the
Code. The acquired capital loss carryovers and their expiration dates
are:

Loss Carryover      Expiration
- ------------------------------------
   $11,425,662      August 31, 2009
     9,790,616      August 31, 2010

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $190,690,385, resulting
in gross unrealized  appreciation and depreciation of $19,092,173 and
$5,679,118, respectively, or net unrealized  appreciation of
$13,413,055.

I) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to shareholders from net
investment income are recorded by the fund on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. The amount and character of
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations.

Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets of the fund. Such fee
is based on the annual rate of 0.75% of the average weekly net assets of
the fund.

Effective September 13, 2004, Putnam Invest ments Limited ("PIL"), an
affiliate of Putnam Management is authorized by the Trustees to manage a
separate portion of the assets of the fund as determined by Putnam
Management from time to time. Putnam Management pays a quarterly
sub-management fee to PIL for its services at an annual rate of 0.40% of
the average net assets of the portion of the fund managed by PIL.

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company ("PFTC"), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor servicing agent
functions to the fund. During the six months ended February 28, 2005,
the fund paid PFTC $100,286 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. The fund also reduced expenses through
brokerage service arrangements. For the six months ended February 28,
2005, the fund's expenses were reduced by $2,262 under these
arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $1,287, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund,
and an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees
receive additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense
for the fund is included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the
statement of operations. Accrued pension liability is included in
Payable for Trustee compensation and expenses in the statement of assets
and liabilities. The Trustees have terminated the Pension Plan with
respect to any Trustee first elected after 2003.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended February 28, 2005, cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities other than short-term
investments aggregated $33,709,923 and $33,901,231, respectively. There
were no purchases or sales of U.S. government securities.

Note 4
Investment in Putnam Prime Money Market Fund

Pursuant to an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the fund invests in Putnam Prime Money Market Fund, an
open-end management investment company managed by Putnam Management.
Management fees paid by the fund are reduced by an amount equal to the
management fees paid by Putnam Prime Money Market Fund with respect to
assets invested by the fund in Putnam Prime Money Market Fund. For the
period ended February 28, 2005, management fees paid were reduced by
$2,591 relating to the fund's investment in Putnam Prime Money Market
Fund. Income distributions earned by the fund are recorded as income in
the statement of operations and totaled $38,965 for the period ended
February 28, 2005.

Note 5
Regulatory matters and litigation

Putnam Management has entered into agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities Division settling
charges connected with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees and,
in the case of the charges brought by the Massachusetts Securities Division,
by participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans. Pursuant to these
settlement agreements, Putnam Manage ment will pay a total of $193.5 million
in penalties and restitution, with $153.5 million being paid to shareholders
and the funds. The restitution amount will be allocated to shareholders
pursuant to a plan developed by an independent consultant, with payments to
shareholders currently expected by the end of the summer.

The SEC's and Massachusetts Securities Division's allegations and
related matters also serve as the general basis for numerous lawsuits,
including purported class action lawsuits filed against Putnam
Management and certain related parties, including certain Putnam funds.
Putnam Manage ment will bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in
connection with these lawsuits. Putnam Management believes that the
likelihood that the pending private lawsuits and purported class action
lawsuits will have a material adverse financial impact on the fund is
remote, and the pending actions are not likely to materially affect its
ability to provide investment management services to its clients,
including the Putnam funds.

On March 23, 2005, Putnam Management entered into a settlement with the
SEC resolving its inquiry into Putnam Management's alleged failure to
fully and effectively disclose a former brokerage allocation practice to
the Board of Trustees and shareholders of the Putnam Funds. This
practice, which Putnam Management ceased as of January 1, 2004, involved
allocating a portion of the brokerage on mutual fund portfolio
transactions to certain broker-dealers who sold shares of Putnam mutual
funds. Under the settlement order, Putnam Management has paid a civil
penalty of $40 million and disgorgement of $1 to the SEC. These amounts
subsequently will be distributed to certain Putnam funds pursuant to a
plan to be approved by the SEC. As part of the settlement, Putnam
Management neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.

Note 6
Acquisition of Putnam High Income
Opportunities Trust

On January 21, 2005, the fund issued 8,694,024 shares in exchange for
3,712,567 shares of Putnam High Income Opportunities Trust to acquire
that fund's net assets in a tax-free exchange approved by the
shareholders. The net assets of the fund and Putnam High Income
Opportunities Trust on January 21, 2005, valuation date, were
$119,743,477 and $75,299,313, respectively. On January 21, 2005, Putnam
High Income Opportunities Trust had distributions in excess of net
investment income of $439,279, accumulated net realized loss of
$21,080,625 and unrealized appreciation of $4,326,390. The aggregate net
assets of the fund immediately following the acquisition were
$195,042,790.

Information presented in the Statement of operations and changes in net
assets reflect only the operations of Putnam High Income Bond Fund.


Results of January 13, 2005 shareholder meeting
(Unaudited)

A special meeting of the shareholders of the fund was held on January
13, 2005. At the meeting, the proposed merger of Putnam High Income
Opportunities Trust into Putnam High Income Bond Fund was approved. In
this merger, Putnam High Income Bond Fund will acquire all of the assets
of Putnam High Income Opportunities Trust in exchange for the issuance
and delivery of shares of beneficial interest of Putnam High Income Bond
Fund and the assumption by Putnam High Income Bond Fund of the
liabilities of Putnam High Income Opportunities Trust and the
distribution of such shares to the shareholders of Putnam High Income
Opportunities Trust. This was approved as follows:
