TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

June 10, 2005

     The convertible securities sector of the market has underperformed the
stock and bond markets during the first two quarters of Bancroft's fiscal year,
according to Citigroup. This is unusual. Convertibles rarely underperform both
markets simultaneously. The causes appear to include a decline in convertible
arbitrage activity (usually undertaken by hedge funds and other financial
institutions, but not Bancroft) as well as poor performance by the stocks
underlying the convertibles.

     The convertible arbitrage community has developed several mathematical
models for measuring theoretical value for the convertible securities market.
Merrill Lynch measures the discount or premium to this theoretical value. They
have shown that convertibles have moved to a discount to theoretical value as
large as any seen since the summer of 2003.* However, the discount to
theoretical value is much lower than it was in early 2002. Further, there is an
analytic known as delta. This is a measure of how sensitive a convertible may be
to stock price changes. A delta of 50 implies that the convertible should
reflect half of the price movement of the underlying common stock. The average
delta of the convertible market has fluctuated from 75 in February of 2002 to 36
in September, 2002. The current level is just over 50.**

     Taken together, these facts indicate that the convertible market is in a
middle area; historically neither cheap nor expensive. This reinforces our
position that the bottom-up choices of stock, convertible and industry are
important to overall performance.

     The Fund's audit committee has recently approved the hiring of our new
independent auditors, Tait, Weller & Baker. This audit firm specializes in
mutual funds and other firms in the financial services industry.

     During the last quarter, industries in which the Fund currently invests
that have underperformed include banking/savings and loan, and automotive. We
believe these have declined due to the expectation of a rise in short-term
interest rates and reduced expectations for economic growth. Industries that
outperformed include energy, which has been helped by high oil prices, and
consumer goods which have been helped by continued growth in consumer demand.

        Bancroft Convertible Fund is the oldest closed-end convertible fund.
Founded in 1971, the Fund's strategy has remained consistent, as an equity
investment that uses convertible securities to reduce risk and volatility. This
strategy tends to outperform in bear markets and lag in bull markets. The
performance of the Fund's NAV was in line with the average of its peer-group for
the quarter ended April 30, 2005 while outperforming the average for the
ten-year period ended April 30, 2005. However, for the one year and five years
ended April 30, 2005, Bancroft underperformed the average of the funds in its
category. Our peers consist of twelve closed-end convertible funds tracked by
Lipper, Inc. and published in the LIPPER CLOSED-END PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS.+ Of
the twelve funds in the category, only six, including the Fund, remain
unleveraged convertible funds. In addition, many of our competitors have had
greater exposure to non-convertible, low-rated, high yield debt than the Fund
has had. We believe these factors contributed to the difference in performance
between Bancroft and many of the other funds in the group.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY
Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (the "Fund"), established in 1971, is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end management
investment company. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial
statements:

(A)  SECURITY VALUATION
Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at
market using the last reported sales price as of the close of regular
trading. Unlisted securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed
securities for which no sales were reported, are valued at the mean between
closing reported bid and asked prices as of the close of regular trading.
Securities for which quotations are not readily available, restricted securities
and other assets are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by
management with the approval of the Board of Directors. Short-term debt
securities with original maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized
cost.

(B)  SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND RELATED INVESTMENT INCOME
Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date (date the order to buy
or sell is executed) with gain or loss on the sale of securities being
determined based upon identified cost. Dividend income is recorded on the
ex-dividend date and interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, including
accretion of discounts and amortization of non-equity premium. For certain
securities, known as "contingent payment debt instruments," Federal tax
regulations require the Fund to record non-cash, "contingent" interest income in
addition to interest income actually received. Contingent interest income
amounted to 6 cents per share for the six months ended April 30, 2005. In
addition, Federal tax regulations require the Fund to reclassify realized gains
on contingent payment debt instruments to interest income. At April 30, 2005
there were unrealized losses of approximately 2 cents per share on contingent
payment debt instruments.

(C)  CHANGES IN METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR BOND PREMIUM AND DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION
Effective November 1, 2004, the Fund began amortizing discounts and premiums on
all debt securities. Prior to November 1, 2004, the Fund amortized discounts on
original issue discount debt securities. The new method of amortization was
adopted in accordance with the provisions of the AICP AAudit and Accounting
Guide, Audits of Investment Companies and the financial highlights and statement
of changes in net assets presented herein have been restated to reflect the new
method retroactive to November 1, 2001.

The effect of this accounting change is included in the financial highlights for
the years ended October 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, and in the statement of changes
in net assets for the year ended October 31, 2004. The cumulative effect of this
accounting change had no impact on the total net assets of the Fund or on
distributions for tax purposes, but resulted in a $103,986 increase in the cost
of securities held and a corresponding $103,986 reduction in the net unrealized
gains based on the securities held on November 1, 2001. The impact of this
change during the six months ended April 30, 2005 was to reduce net investment
income by $41,542, increase unrealized losses by $73,950 and increase realized
gains by $115,492. These changes had no effect on previously reported total net
assets or total returns.

                                                                         PAGE 11

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)


(D)  FEDERAL INCOME TAXES
The Fund's policy is to distribute substantially all of its taxable income
within the prescribed time and to otherwise comply with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore,
no provision for federal income or excise taxes is believed necessary. At
October 31, 2004, the Fund had available for federal income tax purposes unused
capital losses of $4,470,204, available to offset future net capital gains,
$4,045,634 of which expires in 2010 and $424,570 of which expires in 2011. The
Fund utilized net capital loss carryforwards of $3,760,644 during the year ended
October 31, 2004.

(E)  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS
Distributions to shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the
Fund on the ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are
recorded on the ex-dividend date and paid annually. The amount and character of
income and capital gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted accounting
principles. The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years
ended October 31, 2004 and 2003 were $3,826,570 and $3,445,042, respectively,
both from ordinary income.

(F)  MARKET RISK
It is the Fund's policy to invest at least 80% of its assets in convertible
securities. Although convertible securities do derive part of their value from
that of the securities into which they are convertible, they are not considered
derivative financial instruments. However, certain of the Fund's investments
include features which render them more sensitive to price changes of their
underlying securities. Thus they expose the Fund to greater downside risk than
traditional convertible securities, but generally less than that of the
underlying common stock. The market value of those securities was $21,151,918 at
April 30, 2005, representing 19.0% of net assets.

2.   MANAGEMENT FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES
The management fee is paid to the investment adviser, Davis-Dinsmore Management
Company (the "Adviser"). The contract provides for payment of a monthly advisory
fee, computed at an annual rate of 3/4 of 1% of the first $100,000,000 and 1/2
of 1% of the excess over $100,000,000 of the Fund's net asset value in such
month.

The Adviser furnishes investment advice, office equipment and facilities, and
pays the salaries of all executive officers of the Fund. The Fund pays all
expenses incurred by it and not assumed by the Adviser and in addition will pay
the costs and expenses of its Treasurer's office, up to a maximum of $25,000 per
year, incurred in connection with its performance of certain services for the
Fund. These services include the valuation of securities owned by the Fund, and
the preparation of financial statements and schedules of the Fund's investments
for inclusion in certain periodic reports to the Fund's Board of Directors and
to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the maintenance of files
relating to the foregoing, and rent, personnel costs and other overhead expenses
allocable to the aforementioned services.

3.   PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY
At April 30, 2005 there were 5,588,453 shares of $.01 par value common stock
outstanding (9,000,000 shares authorized). During the six months ended April 30,
2005, 31,315 shares were issued in connection with reinvestment of dividends
from net investment income, resulting in an increase in paid-in capital of
$582,476.

Purchases and sales of investments, exclusive of corporate short-term notes,
aggregated $40,147,797 and $41,028,139, respectively, for the six months ended
April 30, 2005.

A distribution of $0.17 per share from net investment income was declared on May
17, 2005, payable June 29, 2005 to shareholders of record at the close of
business June 15, 2005.

BOARD APPROVAL OF ADVISORY CONTRACT

THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF BANCROFT RENEWED THE ADVISORY CONTRACT WITH
DAVIS-DINSMORE MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN NOVEMBER 2004. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE
MATERIAL FACTORS AND CONCLUSIONS THAT FORMED THE BASIS FOR THAT APPROVAL.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE ADVISORY SERVICES PROVIDED BY DAVIS-DINSMORE. Based
on the independent directors' review of the services provided and to be provided
by Davis-Dinsmore under the Advisory Agreement, the independent directors
concluded that the range of services to be provided by Davis-Dinsmore under the
Advisory Agreement was appropriate and that Davis-Dinsmore currently is
providing services in accordance with the terms of each Advisory Agreement.

THE QUALITY OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY DAVIS-DINSMORE. In reviewing the
qualifications of Davis-Dinsmore to provide investment advisory services, the
independent directors reviewed the credentials and experience of
Davis-Dinsmore's investment personnel, and considered such issues as
Davis-Dinsmore's portfolio and product review process, compliance function, use
of technology, portfolio administration function, investment research operations
and trading operations. Based on the review of these and other factors, the
independent directors concluded that the quality of services to be provided by
Davis-Dinsmore was appropriate and that Davis-Dinsmore currently is providing
satisfactory services in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement.

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND RELATIVE TO COMPARABLE FUNDS. The independent
directors reviewed the performance of the Fund against the performance of funds
advised by other advisors with investment strategies comparable to those of the
Fund. The independent directors noted that although during the past year the
Fund has underperformed its peers, the Fund's long-term performance was better,
and concluded that no changes should be made to the Fund's investment objective
or policies at this time. In addition, the independent directors determined that
the Fund's portfolio management team should remain in place.

THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FUND RELATIVE TO INDICES. The independent directors
reviewed the performance of the Fund against the performance of applicable
indices. The independent directors noted that although during the past year the
Fund has underperformed relative to relevant indices, the Fund's long-term
comparative performance was better, and concluded that no changes should be made
to the Fund's investment objective or policies at this time. In addition, the
independent directors determined that the Fund's portfolio management team
should remain in place.

MEETINGS WITH THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO MANAGER AND INVESTMENT PERSONNEL. The
independent directors noted that they meet regularly with the Fund's portfolio
manager and investment personnel, and believe that such individuals are
competent and able to continue to carry out their responsibilities under the
Advisory Agreement.

OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF DAVIS-DINSMORE. After considering the overall performance
of Davis-Dinsmore in providing investment advisory and portfolio administrative
services to the Fund, the independent directors concluded that such performance
was satisfactory.

FEES RELATIVE TO THOSE OF CLIENTS OF DAVIS-DINSMORE WITH COMPARABLE INVESTMENT
STRATEGIES. The independent directors noted that the Fund and Ellsworth
Convertible Growth and Income Fund are the only clients of Davis-Dinsmore, and
that the advisory fee rates for the funds are the same. The independent
directors concluded that, because the fee rates are the same for each fund, the
current advisory fee rate of a fund was fair as compared to the rate for the
other fund.

FEES RELATIVE TO THOSE OF COMPARABLE FUNDS WITH OTHER ADVISERS. After reviewing
the advisory fee rate for the Fund against the advisory fee rates for funds
advised by other advisors with investment strategies comparable to those of the
Fund, the independent directors determined that the Fund's advisory fee rate was
at approximately the median of the funds in its peer group, and concluded that
the current advisory fee rate of the Fund was fair and reasonable.

EXPENSE LIMITATIONS AND FEE WAIVERS. The independent directors noted that,
although there are no contractual expense limitations or fee waivers in effect
for the Fund, Davis-Dinsmore is very diligent in its efforts to keep expenses of
the Fund as low as possible. The independent directors also noted that the
Fund's expense ratios had declined as a result of the Fund's rights offering in
late 2003, but that

                                                                         PAGE 13

<PAGE>

BOARD APPROVAL OF ADVISORY CONTRACT (CONTINUED)

the cost of compliance with regulatory initiatives was increasing. The
independent directors concluded that the current level of expenses for the Fund
was reasonable.

BREAKPOINTS AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The independent directors reviewed the
structure of the Fund's advisory fee under the Advisory Agreement, and noted
that the fee includes a significant breakpoint when the Fund's assets reach $100
million. The independent directors noted that breakpoints had become effective
as a result of the Fund's 2003 rights offering, which resulted in lower
management fee expenses as a percentage of assets. The independent directors
concluded that it was not necessary to implement any further changes to the
structure of the advisory fee for the Fund.

PROFITABILITY OF DAVIS-DINSMORE. The independent directors reviewed information
concerning the profitability and financial condition of Davis-Dinsmore, noting
that Davis-Dinsmore's sole source of revenue was advisory fees from Bancroft and
Ellsworth Convertible Growth and Income Fund. The Board noted that
Davis-Dinsmore's operations remain profitable, and that the continued success of
the two funds will positively impact Davis-Dinsmore's profitability. Based on
the review of the profitability of Davis-Dinsmore and its financial condition,
the independent directors concluded that the compensation to be paid by Bancroft
to Davis-Dinsmore under its Advisory Agreement was not excessive.

BENEFITS OF SOFT DOLLARS TO DAVIS-DINSMORE. The independent directors discussed
the fact that there are no third-party soft dollar arrangements in effect with
respect to the Fund. The independent directors recognized that Davis-Dinsmore
does receive proprietary research from brokers with whom it executes portfolio
transactions on behalf of the Fund. This research is used by Davis-Dinsmore in
making investment decisions for the Fund. The directors also considered
representations made by Davis-Dinsmore that portfolio transactions received best
execution. Because such research ultimately benefits the Fund, the Board
concluded that it was appropriate to receive proprietary research.

DAVIS-DINSMORE'S FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS IN LIGHT OF THE NEEDS OF THE FUND. The
independent directors considered whether Davis-Dinsmore is financially sound and
has the resources necessary to perform its obligations under the Advisory
Agreement, and concluded that Davis-Dinsmore has the financial resources
necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Advisory Agreement.

HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FUND AND DAVIS-DINSMORE. In determining
whether to continue the Advisory Agreement for the Fund, the independent
directors also considered the prior relationship between Davis-Dinsmore and the
Fund, as well as the independent directors' knowledge of Davis-Dinsmore's
operations, and concluded that it was beneficial to maintain the current
relationship, in part, because of such knowledge. The independent directors also
reviewed the general nature of the non-investment advisory services currently
performed by Davis-Dinsmore, such as administrative services, and the fees
received by Davis-Dinsmore for performing such services. In addition to
reviewing such services, the independent directors also considered the
organizational structure employed by Davis-Dinsmore to provide those services.
Based on the review of these and other factors, the independent directors
concluded that Davis-Dinsmore was qualified to continue to provide
non-investment advisory services to the Funds, including administrative
services, and that Davis-Dinsmore currently is providing satisfactory
non-investment advisory services.

OTHER FACTORS AND CURRENT TRENDS. The independent directors considered the
culture of compliance and high ethical standards at Davis-Dinsmore, and the
efforts historically and currently undertaken by Davis-Dinsmore to engage in
best practices. The independent directors noted Davis-Dinsmore's historical
adherence to compliance procedures, as well as the Fund's investment objectives,
policies and restrictions. The independent directors concluded that this
commitment to adhere to the highest ethical standards was an important factor in
their determination that they should continue the Advisory Agreement for the
Fund.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After consideration of all of the above factors, the independent directors found
that with respect to the Fund: (i) the services provided by Davis-Dinsmore to
such Fund and its shareholders were adequate; (ii) such Fund's Advisory
Agreement was fair and reasonable under the circumstances; and (iii) the fees
payable under such Fund's Advisory Agreement would have been obtained through
arm's length negotiations. The independent directors therefore concluded that
the Fund's Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of such Fund and its
shareholders and should be continued for another year.

MISCELLANEOUS NOTES (CONTINUED)

CHANGE IN THE FUND'S INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT

On March 17, 2005, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") resigned as independent
registered public accountants for the Fund. The Fund's audit committee appointed
Tait, Weller & Baker as independent accountants for the Fund on April 12, 2005
for the 2005 fiscal year, which appointment was ratified by the Fund's
independent directors. The reports of PwC on the Fund's financial statements for
each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2004 and October 31, 2003 contained
no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified
as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the Fund's
fiscal years ended October 31, 2003 and October 31, 2004 and during the period
November 1, 2004 through March 17, 2005, there have been no disagreements with
PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure which, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of PwC, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their
reports on the financial statements for such years.

recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
by the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission; and (2) that
material information relating to the Registrant is made known to the PEO and
PFO as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

(b) There were no changes in the Registrant's internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Investment Company Act of
1940) that occurred during the Registrant's second fiscal quarter of the period
covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
