Dear Fellow Shareholder:

You may have read recent press coverage regarding  investigations
involving Putnam Investments. Last month all Putnam shareholders were
sent a letter detailing the steps being taken by Putnam to address the
issues raised by federal and state regulators. Since then, a number of
remedial actions, some of which were discussed in last month's letter,
are being instituted under the terms of an order from the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). These include stringent employee trading
restrictions, enhanced compliance standards and systems, new redemption
fees for certain fund shares held less than three months, and a process
for making full monetary restitution for any losses to fund
shareholders. This process will be directed by an independent third
party approved by the SEC and by Putnam's Board of Trustees.

The Board is also continuing its own independent investigation of these
issues and when complete a report will be issued detailing the
additional steps being taken to make sure that nothing like this happens
at Putnam again. We believe that the new senior management team at
Putnam is fully committed to re-establishing the firm as a model for the
highest ethical standards in the mutual fund industry. Our Board is
committed to working with Putnam's management to ensure that everything
possible is done to restore your full confidence in the Putnam
organization.

In terms of Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust's performance, we are
pleased to report positive results for the six months ended October 31,
2003. In addition, your fund outperformed both its benchmark and its
Lipper category average at net asset value. The details are shown on the
facing page. In their report, your fund's managers cite the portfolio's
small allocation to higher-yielding, lower-rated issues and defensive
positioning as positive factors during the period. They also offer their
views on prospects for the fiscal year's second half.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

John A. Hill                  George Putnam, III

Report from Fund Management

Fund highlights

 * Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust's total return for the six months
   ended October 31, 2003, was 3.50% at net asset value (NAV) and 5.82% at
   market price.

 * The fund's return at NAV was significantly ahead of the Lehman
   Municipal Bond Index, which returned 1.47% for the six-month period, in
   large part reflecting price recovery in the fund's airline-related
   industrial development bonds (IDBs).

 * These IDB holdings and the fund's duration strategies also helped it
   exceed (at NAV) the average for the Lipper Closed-End General Municipal
   Debt Funds (Leveraged) category, which was 2.68% for the period.

 * See the Performance Summary beginning on page 8 for complete fund
   performance, comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

Improving economic numbers and an environment of relative optimism this
spring made income-oriented investors more willing to accept the risks
associated with lower-quality, high-yield bonds. Consequently, for the
first time in many months, investment-grade and high-yield securities
began to outperform Treasuries. Nonetheless, the past six months were
volatile. The fund's positive results primarily reflect strong price
appreciation from its airline-related industrial development bonds
(IDBs), as discussed on page 4.

Adjustments we made to the fund's duration -- a measure of interest-rate
sensitivity -- also helped performance during the period. By shifting
the portfolio into a shorter, more defensive duration, we were able to
protect the portfolio's value early in the summer and again in October,
when rising interest rates depressed bond prices.

FUND PROFILE

The fund seeks to provide high current income free from federal income
tax, consistent with the preservation of capital, by investing in
investment-grade and some below-investment-grade municipal bonds. The
fund may be appropriate for investors seeking tax-free income and who
are willing to accept a moderate degree of risk.

However, generally rising stock prices took center stage during the past
six months, while lower tax rates reduced the attractiveness of
tax-exempt securities. Investor attention became more focused on
equities. We believe this may help explain the fact that returns at
market price lagged the fund's results at net asset value, despite the
overall demand for high-yield securities during the period.


Market overview

Municipal bond yields -- which move in the opposite direction of their
prices -- were unusually volatile between May 1 and October 31, 2003.
Concern about deflation led to falling yields and higher bond prices
through mid June. After rising through August, yields receded again in
September, on unfavorable housing and unemployment data. October's
positive economic surprises sent yields back up. Overall, yields ended
the semiannual period higher.

The spread, or difference between yields of 10-year municipal bonds and
10-year Treasuries, widened, with municipals yielding close to their
long-term average of 85% of comparable Treasury yields at the end of
October, after yielding nearly 100% of Treasury yields earlier in the
year. Investor demand for higher-yielding municipals increased. As the
economy improved, airline-related industrial development bonds
outperformed other municipal bonds. California general obligation bonds
were downgraded and underperformed as the state's budget crisis
worsened. Tobacco settlement bonds outperformed following the Illinois
Supreme Court's favorable ruling on one of the industry's ongoing
litigation matters.

Strategy overview

We shortened duration (a measure of a fund's sensitivity to changes in
interest rates) in May because interest rates were at historically low
levels and were more likely, in our opinion, to rise than to fall. This
defensive strategy helped protect portfolio assets when rates rose
sharply between mid June and the end of July. We resumed a neutral
duration in August and September, as we believed rates were unlikely to
rise further. In September, rates fell again, so we shortened duration
somewhat. This was beneficial when rates rose in October. At the end of
the period, the portfolio's duration remained slightly defensive.

We continued to diversify the fund's holdings, capitalizing on the
opportunity afforded by strong demand for higher-yielding municipal
bonds to take profits and reduce positions in some of the fund's
lower-quality holdings, particularly airline-related industrial
development bonds (IDBs).

Although we had previously reduced the fund's holdings in tobacco
settlement bonds -- bonds secured by the income stream from tobacco
companies' settlement obligations to the states -- Putnam's bond analyst
for this sector has offered support for a more positive view of the
industry. Recently, numerous court cases have been decided in the
industry's favor and we believe these decisions have reduced, somewhat,
the perceived risk of unfavorable rulings that could affect the
stability of the bonds' income stream. Accordingly, the fund has
purchased more tobacco settlement bonds, and brought the weighting to
neutral (i.e., roughly the same percentage), in comparison to the fund's
benchmark.

How fund holdings and sector allocations affected performance

Many of the fund's top performers during the period were airline-related
industrial development bonds (IDBs). These municipal bonds are usually
issued to finance local expansion by various businesses and are backed
by revenues from the companies benefiting from the financing. As a
result, IDB prices are affected by investor perceptions of the health of
the backing company or of the industry group. Especially since the
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, airline-backed IDBs (generally
issued to finance airport facility expansion) have been negatively
affected by declining air traffic, high fixed costs, and high-profile
bankruptcies. As the prospects for economic recovery have improved, the
airline market has strengthened and concerns about bankruptcies have
diminished. The result has been a sharp price recovery for these bonds,
and we used this opportunity to trim the fund's airline IDBs, including
airport facility improvement bonds in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and
Texas for United Airlines, Delta Airlines, Northwest Airlines, and
American Airlines, respectively. Since all of them have been in the
portfolio for some time, none of the sales resulted in a profit based on
their acquisition cost, but the fund was able to sell on strength rather
than in distress.

The airline business is one of many industries that have been recovering
with the economy. One of the fund's larger holdings, Pocahontas Parkway
Association Toll Road Revenue Bonds, rose in value as traffic (and
tolls) picked up. We purchased $1.5 million of these bonds when they
were issued in 2000, with a coupon of 5.5% and a maturity date in 2028.
The Pocahontas Parkway, which opened in October of 2002, provides
improved access to the Richmond International Airport and includes the
only bridge crossing the James River for 15 miles. The price of the
bonds fell as traffic fell short of projections and investors became
concerned about the issuer's ability to service debt. However, road
traffic has picked up in the past six months and tolls are closing in on
projected levels. Although traffic will need to increase further in
order to support the bond payments, and the bonds are still trading at a
discount, the outlook for the project has improved and we are cautiously
optimistic.

As a percentage of market value as of 10/31/03. A bond rated Baa or
higher is considered investment grade. The chart reflects Moody's and
Standard & Poor's ratings; percentages may include unrated bonds
considered by Putnam Management to be of comparable quality. Ratings
will vary over time.

As part of our efforts to maintain broad diversification, we recently
added some tobacco settlement bonds after a series of favorable court
rulings made this sector more attractive again. These bonds are issued
by municipalities and secured by settlements from class-action lawsuits
against the tobacco industry. The fund had a modest exposure to tobacco
bonds last year, reflecting our concern about possible weakness in
tobacco companies' revenues. We trimmed the fund's holdings in March,
when several court cases threatened to go against the tobacco companies,
but a series of recent rulings have been more favorable. Since these
bonds have attractive coupons and provide a sector diversification that
is part of our overall strategy, we recently added $2.6 million in
Badger Tobacco Asset Securitization bonds issued in Wisconsin. They have
a coupon of 7%, mature in 2028, and are rated Baa2 by Moody's.

Also as part of our diversification program, in the past six months we
have been trimming some of the largest positions, while capitalizing on
increased demand for higher-yielding municipal bonds. For example, the
fund had a $4 million position in Johnson City, Tennessee Health and
Educational Facilities for Mountain States Health, the primary hospital
system in Tennessee. The bonds were issued with a coupon of 7.5%, mature
in 2033, and are rated Baa2 by Moody's. We trimmed back on this large
holding and used the proceeds to diversify into comparable issues in
other states. Specifically, we purchased $1.25 million in bonds issued
by South Carolina Economic Development Authority Hospital Facilities for
Palmetto Health Alliance. Palmetto has a capable management team and a
dominant market share in Columbia, South Carolina and the surrounding
region. The new bonds will refund Palmetto's existing bond debt and fund
construction of a 123-bed heart hospital. The securities we purchased
have a coupon of 6%, mature in 2020, and are rated Baa2 by Moody's.

Although the past several months have been positive for the bond market
as a whole -- especially higher-yielding municipal bonds -- not
everything has gone up. One example is Atlas Boston Tax Exempt Revenue
Bonds, a tax-exempt  collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO). CMOs are
mortgage-backed securities composed of several classes of bonds, each
with its own risk characteristics and maturity, all backed by the same
mortgage collateral. In 1999, we bought the Atlas Boston bonds, which
had a coupon of 6.65% and a maturity date in 2035. The proceeds were
supposed to be spread over a wide variety of projects, but only two
multi-family housing projects were funded. Both projects had physical
problems requiring  extensive repairs, and these resulted in cash-flow
shortages that prevented the issuer from being able to service its debt.
Over the past 12 months, we have sold approximately two thirds of the
original position, and we are currently negotiating the sale of the
remaining bonds.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in  accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary
in the future.

The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

We anticipate continued volatility in the coming six months, and we
believe the Federal Reserve Board will hold the federal funds rate
steady at 1%. Our 12- to 18-month outlook is less certain. If economic
policy succeeds, we may experience a classic bear market for bonds that
may push yields higher. However, it is also possible that the economy
may not respond satisfactorily to fiscal and monetary policy, and the
yield on 10-year Treasuries could fall. Given this degree of
uncertainty, we have, at this time, positioned the fund's duration
somewhat defensively, and we believe rates may rise in the short term.
Currently, we no longer see much opportunity to capitalize on yield
spreads between municipal bonds and Treasuries, as the relationship
between them is now near the long-term average. We expect that the
credit quality of general obligation municipal bonds will remain under
pressure, because tax revenues cannot be expected to grow significantly
until taxpayers begin to report improved earnings. Although yield
spreads between high- and low-quality municipal bonds have narrowed
somewhat, we believe they could narrow further. As a result, we may see
more opportunity for potential gain in this area. In keeping with the
fund's objective, we will continue to monitor market conditions as we
pursue a high level of tax-free income and manage the fund's risk
exposures.

Management. They are not meant as investment advice.

assuming you held the shares through the entire period and reinvested
all  distributions in the fund.

Net asset value (NAV) is the value of all your fund's assets, minus any
liabilities and the net assets allocated to remarketed preferred shares
divided by the number of outstanding common shares.

Market price is the current trading price of one share of the fund.
Market prices are set by transactions between buyers and sellers on the
New York Stock Exchange.

A note about duplicate mailings

In response to investors' requests, the SEC has modified mailing
regulations for proxy statements, semiannual and annual reports, and
prospectuses. Putnam is now able to send a single copy of these
materials to customers who share the same address. This change will
automatically apply to all shareholders except those who notify us. If
you would prefer to receive your own copy, please call Putnam at
1-800-225-1581.


A guide to the financial statements

These sections of the report, as well as the accompanying Notes,
constitute the fund's financial statements.

The fund's portfolio lists all the fund's investments and their values
as of the last day of the reporting period. Holdings are organized by
asset type and industry sector, country, or state to show areas of
concentration and diversification.

Statement of assets and liabilities shows how the fund's net assets and
share price are determined. All investment and noninvestment assets are
added together. Any unpaid expenses and other liabilities are subtracted
from this total. The result is divided by the number of shares to
determine the net asset value per share, which is calculated separately
for each class of shares. (For funds with preferred shares, the amount
subtracted from total assets includes the net assets allocated to
remarketed preferred shares.)

Statement of operations shows the fund's net investment gain or loss.
This is done by first adding up all the fund's earnings -- from
dividends and interest income -- and subtracting its operating expenses
to determine net investment income (or loss). Then, any net gain or loss
the fund realized on the sales of its holdings -- as well as any
unrealized gains or losses over the period -- is added to or subtracted
from the net investment result to determine the fund's net gain or loss
for the fiscal period.

Statement of changes in net assets shows how the fund's net assets were
affected by distributions to shareholders and by changes in the number
of the fund's shares. It lists distributions and their sources (net
investment income or realized capital gains) over the current reporting
period and the most recent fiscal year-end. The distributions listed
here may not match the sources listed in the Statement of operations
because the distributions are determined on a tax basis and may be paid
in a different period from the one in which they were earned.

Financial highlights provide an overview of the fund's investment
results,   per-share distributions, expense ratios, net investment
income ratios, and portfolio turnover in one summary table, reflecting
the five most recent reporting periods. In a semiannual report, the
highlight table also includes the current reporting period. For open-end
funds, a separate table is provided for each share class.

Notes to financial statements
October 31, 2003 (Unaudited)

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust (the "fund") is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company. The fund's investment
objective is to seek a high level of current income exempt from federal
income tax and consistent with the preservation of capital. The fund
intends to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio of
investment grade municipal bonds that Putnam Investment Management, LLC
("Putnam Management"), the fund's manager, an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Putnam, LLC, believes to be  consistent with preservation
of capital.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Tax-exempt bonds and notes are valued on the basis
of valuations provided by an independent pricing service, approved by
the Trustees. Such services use information with respect to transactions
in bonds, quotations from bond dealers, market transactions in
comparable securities and various relationships between securities in
determining value. Restricted securities are valued at fair value
following procedures approved by the Trustees. Such valuations and
procedures are reviewed periodically by the Trustees.

B) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums/discounts
are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis. The premium in
excess of the call price, if any, is amortized to the call date;
thereafter, any remaining premium is amortized to maturity.

C) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated
investment companies. It is also the intention of the fund to distribute
an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax under Section
4982 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Therefore, no
provision has been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or
unrealized appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income
and capital gains.

At April 30, 2003, the fund had a capital loss carryover of $14,831,099
available to the extent allowed by tax law to offset future net capital
gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration dates are:

Loss Carryover    Expiration
- --------------------------------
    $4,581,245    April 30, 2004
       126,586    April 30, 2007
     2,788,662    April 30, 2008
     1,503,027    April 30, 2009
     2,243,569    April 30, 2010
     3,588,010    April 30, 2011

Pursuant to federal income tax regulations applicable to regulated
investment companies, the fund has elected to defer to its fiscal year
ending April 30, 2004 approximately $2,849,439 of losses recognized
during the period November 1, 2002 to April 30, 2003.

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $316,975,642, resulting
in gross unrealized appreciation and depreciation of $15,987,529 and
$7,314,182, respectively, or net unrealized  appreciation of $8,673,347.

D) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to common and preferred
shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the fund on the
ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded
on the ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. Dividends on
remarketed preferred shares become payable when, as and if declared by
the Trustees. Each dividend period for the remarketed preferred shares
is generally a 28-day period for Series A and a 7-day period for Series
B and Series C. The applicable dividend rate for the remarketed
preferred shares on October 31, 2003 was Series A 0.90%, Series B 0.89%,
and Series C 0.90%. The amount and character of income and gains to be
distributed are determined in accordance with income tax regulations,
which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital accounts to reflect
income and gains available for distribution (or available capital loss
carryovers) under income tax regulations.

E) Determination of net asset value Net asset value of the common shares
is determined by dividing the value of all assets of the fund, less all
liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding remarketed
preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding as of
period end.

Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Compensation of Putnam Management, for management and investment
advisory services is paid quarterly based on the average net assets of
the fund. Such fee is based on 0.65% of the fund's average weekly net
assets.

If dividends payable on remarketed preferred shares during any dividend
payment period plus any expenses attributable to remarketed preferred
shares for that period exceed the fund's gross income attributable to
the proceeds of the remarketed preferred shares during that period, then
the fee payable to Putnam Management for that period will be reduced by
the amount of the excess (but not more than 0.65% of the liquidation
preference of the remarketed preferred shares outstanding during the
period).

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company (PFTC), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Investor
servicing agent functions are provided by Putnam Investor Services, a
division of PFTC.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the six months ended October 31,
2003, the fund's expenses were reduced by $11,881 under these
arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $687 has been allocated to the fund, and an additional fee for
each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive additional fees for
attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension
expense for the fund is included in Trustee compensation and expenses in
the Statement of operations. Accrued pension liability is included in
Payable for Trustee compensation and expenses in the Statement of assets
and liabilities.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended October 31, 2003, cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities other than short-term
investments aggregated $39,521,187 and $45,947,157, respectively. There
were no purchases and sales of U.S. government obligations.

Note 4
Preferred shares

The Series A, B and C shares are redeemable at the option of the fund on
any dividend payment date at a redemption price of $50,000, $25,000 and
$25,000, respectively per share, plus an amount equal to any dividends
accumulated on a daily basis but unpaid through the redemption date
(whether or not such dividends have been declared) and, in certain
circumstances, a call premium.

It is anticipated that dividends paid to holders of remarketed preferred
shares will be considered tax-exempt dividends under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. To the extent that the fund earns taxable income
and capital gains by the conclusion of a fiscal year, it may be required
to apportion to the holders of the remarketed preferred shares
throughout that year additional dividends as necessary to result in an
after-tax equivalent to the applicable dividend rate for the period.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is required to
maintain asset coverage of at least 200% with respect to the remarketed
preferred shares as of the last business day of each month in which any
such shares are outstanding. Additionally, the fund is required to meet
more stringent asset coverage requirements under terms of the remarketed
preferred shares and the shares' rating agencies. Should these
requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the remarketed
preferred shares not be paid, the fund may be restricted in its ability
to declare dividends to common shareholders or may be required to redeem
certain of the remarketed preferred shares. At October 31, 2003, no such
restrictions have been placed on the fund.

Note 5
Regulatory matters and litigation

On November 13, 2003, Putnam Management agreed to entry of an order
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in partial
resolution of administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings
initiated by the SEC on October 28, 2003 in connection with alleged
excessive short-term trading by at least six Putnam Management
investment professionals. The SEC's findings reflect that four of
those employees engaged in such trading in funds over which they had
investment decision-making responsibility and had access to
non-public information regarding, among other things, current
portfolio holdings, and valuations. The six individuals no longer
have investment responsibilities with Putnam Management. Under the
order, Putnam Management will make restitution for losses
attributable to excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees,
institute new employee trading restrictions and enhanced employee
trading compliance, retain an independent compliance consultant, and
take other remedial actions. Putnam Management neither admitted nor
denied the order's findings, which included findings that Putnam
Management willfully violated provisions of the federal securities
laws. A civil monetary penalty and other monetary relief, if any,
will be determined at a later date. If a hearing is necessary to
determine the amounts of such penalty or other relief, Putnam
Management will be precluded from arguing that it did not violate
the federal securities laws in the manner described in the SEC
order, the findings set forth in the SEC order will be accepted as
true by the hearing officer and additional evidence may be
presented. Putnam Management, and not the investors in any Putnam
fund, will bear all costs, including restitution, civil penalties
and associated legal fees. Administrative proceedings instituted by
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on October 28, 2003 against Putnam
Management in connection with alleged market timing activities by
Putnam employees and by participants in some Putnam-administered
401(k) plans are pending. Putnam Management has committed to make
complete restitution for any losses suffered by Putnam shareholders
as a result of any improper market-timing activities by Putnam
employees or within Putnam-administered 401(k) plans.

The SEC's and Commonwealth's allegations and related matters also
serve as the general basis for numerous lawsuits, including
purported class action lawsuits filed against Putnam Management and
certain related parties, including certain Putnam funds. Putnam
Management has agreed to bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in
connection with these lawsuits. Based on currently available
information, Putnam Management believes that the likelihood that the
pending private lawsuits and purported class action lawsuits will
have a material adverse financial impact on the fund is remote, and
the pending actions are not likely to materially affect its ability
to provide investment management services to its clients, including
the Putnam funds.

Review of these matters by counsel for Putnam Management and by
separate independent counsel for the Putnam funds and their
independent Trustees is continuing. In addition, Marsh & McLennan
Companies, Inc., Putnam Management's parent company, has engaged
counsel to conduct a separate review of Putnam Management's policies
and controls related to short-term trading.
