<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">While the Fund&#146;s net asset value performance was in line with that of
its peers, it underperformed the Index due in part to its exposure to
securities with relatively lower-quality ratings, which underperformed
during flights to quality during the reporting period. However, we believe
that over the longer term, the Fund will likely be compensated for the
additional credit risk these securities entail. The Fund&#146;s underweight to
shorter-term (five-year) issues also detracted from returns when those
issues outperformed during the period.<br><br>
While the Fund&#146;s use of leverage over the period helped the Fund to
generate a higher yield for common stockholders, it detracted from overall
results as the market value of the Fund&#146;s securities sharply declined during
the reporting period. As of September 30, 2008, leverage accounted for
approximately 45.1% of the Fund&#146;s total assets. Leverage magnifies returns
on both the upside and on the downside.</font></p>

while the median discount of its Lipper peer group was &#150;13.7%.<br><br>
A fund trades at a discount when the market price at which its shares
trade is less than its net asset value. Alternately, a fund trades at a premium when
the market price at which its shares trade is more than its net asset value per share.
The market price is the price the market is willing to pay for shares of a
fund at a given time, and may be influenced by a range of factors,
including supply and demand and market conditions. Net asset value per share is
determined by dividing the value of the Fund&#146;s securities, cash and
other assets, less all liabilities, by the total number of common shares
outstanding.</font></p>

economy from falling into a deep recession. For example, the Fed and
central banks in other countries have pumped billions of dollars of
liquidity into the financial system in an attempt to facilitate normal
market operations.<br><br>
By the end of September 2008, it was apparent that the troubles in
the US credit markets were spreading to other sectors of the market
and the world, however. This led to a series of dramatic actions by
the US government, including the Treasury Department&#146;s takeover of
mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the government&#146;s
effectively taking control of insurance giant AIG. During September,
Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, Merrill Lynch agreed to be
acquired by Bank of America, and both Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley changed their status to become bank holding companies.
Additionally, Washington Mutual failed and was sold to JPMorgan
Chase, while Wells Fargo took over Wachovia.<br><br>
The Treasury Department also proposed a $700 billion plan to purchase
distressed mortgages from the books of financial companies. After the
US House of Representatives rejected the initial proposal, a revised plan
was approved on October 3, following the conclusion of the reporting
period.<br><br>
Despite the passage of the revised plan by Congress, the unrest and
uncertainty in the financial markets continued throughout October. In
recent weeks, the US government has announced a plan to purchase
stakes in the nation&#146;s largest banks and to guarantee new debt issues
and deposit accounts used by businesses. In addition, the Fed joined
several other central banks from around the world in a coordinated
interest rate cut on October 8, after the reporting period had ended,
followed by another cut on October 29. Together, these reductions
brought the federal funds rate from 2.0% to 1.0%.</font></td>

the six months ended September 30, 2008, the overall taxable US
bond market, as measured by the Barclays Capital US Aggregate Index
(formerly the Lehman Brothers US Aggregate Index), declined 1.50%.<br><br>
The municipal bond market faced severe price dislocation during the
reporting period. The crisis of confidence in municipal bonds that were
backed by struggling monoline insurers was felt as those insurers
suffered downgrades from the credit rating agencies because of their
exposure to subprime mortgages and other issues.<br><br>
Late in the period, in September 2008, municipal bond prices fell sharply
as a capital squeeze and a severe lack of liquidity gripped the markets.
Investors shunned securities that even hinted of having any underlying
risk. During the six months ended September 30, 2008, municipal bonds,
as measured by the Barclays Capital Municipal Bond Index (formerly the
Lehman Brothers Municipal Bond Index), fell 2.60%.<br><br>
Even the highest-quality municipal securities were adversely affected by
September&#146;s extreme flight to quality and reported &#147;fire sales&#148; by hedge
funds and other extremely leveraged investors. In our view, the most
recent flight to quality has created opportunities for the Fund, with
municipal bonds appearing attractive relative to Treasuries at the end

<td valign="top" align="left"><font face="sans-serif" size="2">In the past, many bond issuers used bond insurance to bolster the credit
quality of securities that they planned to issue, with a goal of making it
easier and less expensive to access the credit markets. Bond insurance
was intended to strengthen credit quality by offering protection against
default by the issuer or a downgrade if the bond issuer could not meet
its obligations to pay interest and principal to bondholders in a timely
manner. Historically, this also served to enhance the liquidity of insured
bonds because there was greater demand among investors for highly
rated securities. Companies whose primary line of business is to provide
insurance services to one industry are called &#147;monoline&#148; insurers.<br><br>
Prior to 2007, no major monoline insurer had ever been downgraded,
or had defaulted. However, beginning in 2007, the severe weakness in
the housing market and the global credit crisis caused subprime and
adjustable rate mortgages and related securities to experience extreme
strains. At the same time, many monoline bond insurers posted losses</font></td>

than 10% of municipal bonds being issued are backed by monoline

portfolio.)<br><br>
In terms of yield curve positioning, we managed the portfolio in
anticipation of a steepening municipal yield curve. In such an
environment, the difference between the yield on long- and short-term
securities rises. This positioning was beneficial to performance
as the yield curve did steepen during the reporting period.<br><br>
From a yield curve perspective, the Fund was underweight in the
shorter (one- to 10-year) area in relation to the benchmark, which
hurt performance when that area outperformed its longer-term
counterparts. Additionally, an overweight to issues in the intermediate

Within these and other sectors of the municipal market, we sought

securities indiscriminately, driving their prices lower, regardless of their

The Fund also benefited from an exposure to pre-refunded municipal
bonds. Pre-refunded bonds are issues that are scheduled to be called
(retired) on the first possible call date. These bonds are not immediately
retired, but rather secured by an escrow fund that is backed by US
government bonds. The rating of the pre-refunded bond generally
assumes the rating of the government obligations at the time the escrow fund is established. During the reporting period, pre-refunded
bonds were the best-performing sector in the municipal market.</font></td>

<td valign="top" align="left"><font face="sans-serif" size="2">A large portion of outstanding municipal securities are issued by a
fairly small number of states. As of September 30, 2008, approximately
62.9% of the Fund&#146;s holdings were in the securities of issuers in five
states: California, Illinois, New York, Texas, and Florida.<br><br>
As always, we focused on purchasing bonds from states that are, in our
view, experiencing improved fiscal health and offering attractively valued
municipal bonds. We also sought to avoid areas facing budgetary
challenges when possible, given the lack of liquidity in the market.
Given these criteria, we maintained an underweight position to New
York, while we held overweight positions to Texas and Illinois, which
helped performance.<br><br>
In contrast, the Fund&#146;s neutral weight to California was a drag on
performance as it lagged the benchmark during the reporting period.
As a result, we lessened our exposure to California. We plan to
continue to reduce our exposure to California and New York, and seek
opportunities in other areas.</font></td>

government initiatives to add liquidity and restore confidence have
provided some relief to the credit-related issues plaguing the markets,
we expect volatility to remain high.<br><br>
To return order to the municipal bond markets and improve liquidity,
we believe that confidence in the broader capital markets must be
restored. In our opinion, the passage of the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008 is a necessary first step in the larger process
of restoring market functions. We believe that passage of the bill could
lay the foundation for the future health of bank balance sheets,
helping to restore functionality to the short-term market.<br><br>
In the current municipal bond landscape, we believe that the high
amount of new issue supply, coupled with the level of redemptions experienced by mutual funds investing in municipal securities and the
selling of municipal bonds by hedge funds, could slow the return to
lower tax-exempt yields.<br><br>
In our opinion, the September 2008 flight to quality was likely an
overreaction, given the high level of market emotion that appears to have
often ignored the underlying fundamentals of individual securities. We
believe that the municipal market currently offers numerous compelling
opportunities, as a number of high-quality securities are attractively
valued. Looking ahead, we are confident that our investment strategy
and process&#151;focused on underlying credit research and enhanced risk
management&#151;should enable us to capitalize on these opportunities for
the Fund.</font></td>

<p><font face="sans-serif" size="2" color="#00853F"><b>An update on the Fund&#146;s leverage and auction preferred shares
(&#147;APS&#148;):</b></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br>
As we wrote to you in the Fund&#146;s annual shareholder report, APS, a type of
preferred stock issued by many closed-end funds, are used to leverage the
Fund&#146;s investments (that is, buy more municipal securities). In utilizing
leverage, the Fund sought to generate incremental yields and returns for the
Fund&#146;s common shareholders. (For purposes of clarification, purchasers of
APS in a closed-end fund are known as &#147;preferred shareholders,&#148; while the
remaining investors are known as &#147;common shareholders.&#148;)<br><br>
During the reporting period, APS auctions continued to fail as existing
holders of APS looking to sell their shares through the auction process
were unable to do so due to insufficient buy orders. It is important to note
that these failed auctions were not &#147;credit events&#148; for the Fund; that is,
they were not caused by, nor did they result in, a default by the Fund.
Rather, they were liquidity events that impacted a closed-end fund&#146;s
preferred and common shareholders differently.<br><br>
Given that the Fund&#146;s preferred shareholders have experienced a loss of
liquidity due to the inability to sell their APS, they continued to receive
dividends at a &#147;maximum rate.&#148; This rate is based on a formula in the
Fund&#146;s governing documents and is currently calculated and reset on a
weekly basis. Preferred shareholders will continue to receive dividends
calculated in this manner until auctions successfully recommence or APS
shares are redeemed by the Fund or certain other events occur (for
example, APS restructuring).<br><br>
In a press release issued on September 11, 2008, the Fund announced a
partial redemption of $40 million (800 shares) of the Fund&#146;s APS, which
represented approximately 19% of the Fund&#146;s total outstanding APS. In
order to finance these partial redemptions and to diversify sources of
portfolio leverage, the Fund has implemented a tender option bond (&#147;TOB&#148;)
program to partially restructure the Fund&#146;s leverage, yet still maintain a
similar level of economic leverage. Since the program&#146;s implementation
through the end of the reporting period, the program provided savings to
the Fund as the cost of leverage via the TOB program was lower relative
to maximum dividend rates paid on APS.<br><br>
It is expected that the TOB program should provide a lower relative cost of
leverage over time than the total cost of the APS, based on the maximum
rates payable due to the failed APS auctions. The TOB program is also
expected to provide increased flexibility in managing the extent to which
the Fund is leveraged.</font></p>

issues relating to the failed APS auctions and the resulting loss of liquidity

redemption of APS provided a partial solution towards restoring liquidity, the
Fund&#146;s Board and UBS Global Asset Management (Americas) Inc. continue to
evaluate other alternatives including the possibility of restructuring the
remaining APS in a manner that would make the APS eligible for investment
by money market funds.<br><br>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Organization and significant accounting
 policies<br></b>Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the &#147;Fund&#148;) was incorporated
 in Maryland on February 18, 1993, and is registered with the Securities and Exchange
 Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a closed-end
 diversified management investment company. The Fund&#146;s investment objective
 is to achieve a high level of current income that is exempt from federal income
 tax, consistent with the preservation of capital. There can be no assurance that
 the Fund&#146;s investment objective will be achieved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">In the normal course of business the Fund
 may enter into contracts that contain a variety of representations or that provide
 indemnification for certain liabilities. The Fund&#146;s maximum exposure under
 these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made
 against the Fund that have not yet occurred. However, the Fund has not had prior
 claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be
 remote.<br><br>The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US generally
 accepted accounting principles requires the Fund&#146;s management to make estimates
 and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial
 statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a
 summary of significant accounting policies:</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Valuation of investments</b>&#151;The
 Fund calculates its net asset value based on the current market value, where available,
 for its portfolio securities. The Fund normally obtains market values for its securities
 from independent pricing sources and broker-dealers. Independent pricing sources
 may use last reported sale prices, current market quotations or valuations from
 computerized &#147;matrix&#148; systems that derive values based on comparable securities.
 A matrix system incorporates parameters such as security quality, maturity and coupon,
 and/or research and evaluations by its staff, including review of broker-dealer
 market price quotations, if available, in determining the valuation of the portfolio
 securities. If a market value is not available from an independent pricing source
 for a particular security, that security is valued at fair value as determined in
 good faith by or under the direction of the Fund&#146;s Board of Directors (the
 &#147;Board&#148;). Various factors may be reviewed in order to make a good faith
 determination of a security&#146;s fair value. These factors may include, but are
 not limited to, the type and cost of the security; contractual or legal restrictions on resale of the security;
 relevant financial or business</font></p>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">developments of the issuer; actively traded similar
 or related securities; conversion or exchange rights on the security; related corporate
 actions; and changes in overall market conditions. If events occur that materially
 affect the value of securities between the close of trading in those securities
 and the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the securities
 are fair valued. The amortized cost method of valuation, which approximates market
 value, generally is used to value short-term debt instruments with sixty days or
 less remaining to maturity, unless the Board or its delegate determines that this
 does not represent fair value. Securities traded in the over-the-counter (&#147;OTC&#148;) market are valued at the last bid price available on the valuation date prior
 to valuation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) released <i>Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards No. 157 (&#147;FAS
 157&#148;)</i>. FAS 157 requires disclosure surrounding the various inputs that
 are used in determining the value of the Fund&#146;s investments. These inputs are
 summarized into the three broad levels listed below:</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">Level 1&#151;Quoted prices in active markets
 for identical securities.<br>Level 2&#151;Other significant observable inputs, including
 but not limited to, quoted prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment
 speeds and credit risks.<br>Level 3&#151;Unobservable inputs inclusive of the Fund&#146;s own assumptions in determining the value of investments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Floating-rate notes issued in conjunction with securities held&#151;Tender option bond program<br></b>The Fund may sell a fixed-rate bond (&#147;Fixed-Rate Bond&#148;) to a broker who
deposits the Fixed-Rate Bond into a special-purpose entity from which are
issued floating-rate notes (&#147;Floating-Rate Notes&#148;) that are sold to third
parties. The Floating-Rate Notes have interest rates that reset weekly and
the holders of the Floating-Rate Notes have the option to tender their notes
to the broker at par at each reset date. A residual certificate (an &#147;Inverse
Floater&#148;), which pays interest equal to the difference between the Fixed-Rate
Bond and the Floating-Rate Notes, is also issued by the special-purpose
entity. The Inverse Floater also gives the holder the right to cause the
Floating-Rate Note to be called at par and to require transfer of the
Fixed-Rate Bond to the holder of the Inverse Floater, thereby liquidating
the special-purpose entity. In certain transactions, the Fund ultimately
receives the Inverse Floater plus the cash equivalent of the proceeds
raised from the issuance of the Floating-Rate Notes in exchange for the
Fixed-Rate Bonds.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">Although the Fund physically holds the Inverse Floater,
 the transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing pursuant to Statement of
 Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, <i>Accounting for Transfers and Servicing
 of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities</i> (&#147;SFAS 140&#148;),

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Investment transactions and investment
 income</b>&#151;Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized
 gains and losses from investment transactions are calculated using the identified
 cost method. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts are accreted
 and premiums are amortized as adjustments to interest income and the identified
 cost of investments.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Futures contracts</b>&#151;Upon entering
 into a financial futures contract, the Fund is required to deliver to a broker an
 amount of cash and/or securities equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount.
 This amount is known as the &#147;initial margin.&#148; Subsequent payments, known
 as &#147;variation margin&#148;, are made or received by the Fund each day, depending
 on the daily fluctuations in the value of the underlying financial futures contracts.
 Such variation margin is recorded for financial statement purposes on a daily basis
 as unrealized gain or loss until the financial futures contract is closed, at which
 time the net gain or loss is reclassified to realized gain or loss on futures. Variation
 margin calls could be substantial in the event of adverse price movements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">Using financial futures contracts involves
 various market risks. If the Fund was unable to liquidate a futures position due
 to the absence of a liquid secondary market or the imposition of price limits, it
 could incur substantial losses and would continue to be subject to market risk with
 respect to the position. In addition, the Fund would continue to be required to
 make variation margin payments and might be required to maintain the position being
 hedged or to maintain cash or securities in a separate account. Furthermore, certain
 characteristics of the futures market might increase the risk that movements in
 the prices of the financial futures contracts might not correlate perfectly with
 movements in the prices of the investments being hedged, including temporary price
 distortion. The separate account for margin will be maintained at the futures counterparty
 and may be subject to risks or delays if the counterparty becomes insolvent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Dividends and distributions</b>&#151;The Fund intends to pay monthly dividends

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">dividend rate on the common stock is adjusted as necessary
 to reflect the earnings rate of the Fund. Dividends and distributions to common
 shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Dividends to auction preferred
 shareholders are accrued daily. The amount of dividends from net investment income
 and distributions from net realized capital gains is determined in accordance with
 federal income tax regulations, which may differ from US generally accepted accounting
 principles. These &#147;book/tax&#148; differences are either considered temporary
 or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent in nature,
 such amounts are reclassified within the capital accounts based on their federal
 tax-basis treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Concentration of risk<br></b>The Fund
 follows an investment policy of investing primarily in municipal obligations of
 various states. Economic changes affecting those states and certain of their public
 bodies and municipalities may affect the ability of the issuers within those states
 to pay interest on, or repay principal of, municipal obligations held by the Fund.

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Investment advisor and administrator<br>
</b>The Board has approved an Investment Advisory and Administration Contract (&#147;Advisory
 Contract&#148;) with UBS Global Asset Management (Americas) Inc. (&#147;UBS Global
 AM&#148;), under which UBS Global AM serves as investment advisor and administrator
 of the Fund. UBS Global AM is an indirect wholly owned asset management subsidiary
 of UBS AG, an internationally diversified organization with headquarters in Zurich
 and Basel, Switzerland and operations in many areas of the financial services industry.
 In accordance with the Advisory Contract, the Fund is obligated to pay UBS Global
 AM an investment advisory and administration fee, which was accrued weekly and paid
 monthly, at the annual rate of 0.90% of the Fund&#146;s average weekly net assets
 attributable to holders of common and auction preferred shares. Prior to August
 1, 2008, UBS Global AM had agreed to waive a portion of the advisory and administration
 fee, so that the Fund&#146;s effective fee was 0.83% of average weekly net assets
 attributable only to holders of common shares. Effective August 1, 2008, UBS Global
 AM has agreed to waive a portion of the advisory and administration fee so that
 the Fund&#146;s effective fee is 0.50% of average weekly net assets attributable
 only to holders of common shares. This waiver will continue indefinitely unless
 the Board agrees to any change. At September 30, 2008, the Fund owed UBS Global AM $114,746 for investment

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Additional information regarding compensation
 to affiliate of a board member<br></b>Effective March 1, 2005, Professor Meyer Feldberg
 accepted the position of senior advisor to Morgan Stanley, resulting in him becoming
 an interested director of the Fund. The Fund has been informed that Professor Feldberg&#146;s role at Morgan Stanley does not involve matters directly affecting any UBS
 funds. Fund transactions are executed through Morgan Stanley based on that firm&#146;s ability to provide best execution of the transactions. During the six months
 ended September 30, 2008, the Fund purchased and sold certain securities (e.g., fixed
 income securities) in principal trades with Morgan Stanley having an aggregate value
 of $39,719,820. Morgan Stanley received compensation in connection with these trades,
 which may have been in the form of a &#147;mark-up&#148; or &#147;mark-down&#148;
 of the price of the securities, a fee from the issuer for maintaining a commercial
 paper program, or some other form of compensation. Although the precise amount of
 this compensation is not generally known by UBS Global AM, UBS Global AM believes
 that under normal circumstances it represents a small portion of the total value
 of the transactions. In addition, Morgan Stanley may participate as a broker-dealer
 in auctions for the Fund&#146;s auction preferred shares and receive compensation
 therefore. Amounts received by Morgan Stanley, if any, will vary depending upon
 that firm&#146;s participation in an auction, and such amounts are calculated and
 paid by the auction agent from money provided by the Fund.</font></p>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>The Fund<br></b>Insured Municipal Income
 Fund Inc. (the &#147;Fund&#148;) is a diversified, closed-end management investment
 company whose common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (&#147;NYSE&#148;).
 The Fund&#146;s investment objective is to achieve a high level of current income
 that is exempt from federal income tax, consistent with the preservation of capital.
 The Fund&#146;s NYSE trading symbol is &#147;PIF.&#148; Comparative net asset value
 and market price information about the Fund is available weekly in various publications.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Investment policy change<br></b>The Fund&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) has approved the adoption of the
 investment policies discussed below. These guidelines address the treatment of &#147;Inverse Floaters,&#148; a type of security, in the context of rating agency
 guidelines. The purchase of Inverse Floaters is an integral aspect of the Fund&#146;s
 diversification of sources of leverage via the implementation of a tender option
 bond (&#147;TOB&#148;) program, which is discussed further below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Inverse floaters</b>&#151;The Fund may
 invest in municipal obligations where the rate of interest varies inversely with
 interest rates paid on other municipal obligations or an index. These investments
 may include Inverse Floaters acquired as part of the Fund&#146;s leveraging of its
 portfolio through participation in a TOB program. Inverse Floaters typically are
 issued as one of two types of securities issued by a special purpose trust (or similar
 entity) (a &#147;Trust&#148;) and represent interests in an underlying bond (or
 bonds) held by the Trust (a &#147;Fixed-Rate Bond&#148;). The other type of security
 typically issued by such a Trust would be a short-term obligation that pays interest
 at a floating rate that is reset periodically by a remarketing agent or through
 another method (a &#147;Floating-Rate Note&#148;). The Inverse Floater is the &#147;residual&#148; component that pays interest at a rate equal to the difference between the
 rate paid on the Fixed-Rate Bond and the rate paid on the short-term obligation,
 minus the expenses of the Trust. For example, if a Fixed-Rate Bond placed into a
 Trust generated a yield of 4%, the Trust might pay out 1.5% on the Floating-Rate
 Note it issues (depending on market conditions). Another portion of the yield on
 the Fixed-Rate Bond would go to pay the costs of the Trust, and the remainder would
 be paid out to the Inverse Floater holder. If short-term interest rates decrease,
 the value of the Inverse Floater can be expected to increase as more would be &#147;left
 over&#148; to pay to the Inverse Floater holder. If short-term interest rates increase,
 the amount &#147;left over&#148; to pay the Inverse Floater holder would be expected
 to decrease&#151;as the rate of interest paid on the &#147;residual&#148;</font></p>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">component can be expected to vary in the
 opposite direction, or &#147;inversely,&#148; to the amount paid out to the holder
 of the Floating-Rate Note. When the Fund purchases an Inverse Floater as part of
 setting up a TOB structure to achieve leverage, the Fund would consider &#147;collapsing&#148; the
structure and selling the Inverse Floater if the relationship of the short-term
 interest rates to the yields on the Fixed-Rate Bond resulted in the Fund receiving
 less of an economic benefit from the arrangement than believed appropriate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">The market value of an Inverse Floater will
 be more volatile than that of a Fixed-Rate Bond and, like most non-floating debt
 obligations, can be expected to vary inversely with changes in market interest rates,
 but to a different degree. Because the interest rate paid to holders of residual
 components is generally determined by subtracting the interest paid to the holders
 of the Floating-Rate Note from a fixed amount (namely the yield on the Fixed-Rate
 Bond), the interest rate paid on Inverse Floaters will decrease as the floating
 rate paid on the Floating-Rate Note increases. Moreover, the extent of the increases
 and decreases in market value of Inverse Floaters may be larger than comparable
 changes in the market value of an equal principal amount of a Fixed-Rate Bond having
 similar credit quality, redemption provisions and maturity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">The rating agencies that rate the Fund&#146;s
 auction preferred shares (&#147;APS&#148;) may &#147;discount&#148; the value of
 Inverse Floaters held by the Fund for purposes of determining the Fund&#146;s compliance
 with certain asset coverage tests necessary to maintain the APS ratings (currently,
 AAA by Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies Inc.
 (&#147;S&#038;P&#148;), and Aaa by Moody&#146;s Investors Services Inc.). For example,
 S&#038;P requires that an Inverse Floater be discounted by a designated discount
 factor (as described in more detail below), multiplied by the amount of the leverage
 between the floater and the Inverse Floater in the TOB program. The Fund is currently
 authorized to acquire Inverse Floaters with a three-to-one leverage ratio. Consequently,
 S&#038;P requires that an Inverse Floater with a three-to-one leverage ratio multiply
 the applicable discount factor by three when &#147;discounting&#148; the value of
 the Inverse Floater.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">If the Fund is unable to maintain the necessary
 amount of asset coverage to maintain the APS ratings, the Fund may be required to
 dispose of Inverse Floaters or limit the Fund&#146;s use of the leverage generated
 by a TOB program. Such an event may require the Fund to sell portfolio securities
 at times and at prices that may not be favorable to the Fund.</font></p>

 with each dividend will be equal to the result obtained by dividing the amount of
 the dividend payable to a particular shareholder by the average price per share
 (including applicable brokerage commissions) that the transfer agent was able to
 obtain in the open market. The Fund will not issue any new shares of common stock
 in connection with the Plan. There currently is no charge to participants for reinvesting
 dividends or other distributions. The transfer agent&#146;s fees for handling the
 reinvestment of distributions will be paid by the Fund. However, each participant
 pays a pro rata share of brokerage commissions incurred with respect to the transfer

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Background</b>&#151;At a meeting of the
 board of Insured Municipal Income Fund Inc. (the &#147;Fund&#148;) on July 16, 2008,
 the members of the board, including the directors who are not &#147;interested persons&#148; of the Fund (&#147;Independent Directors&#148;), as defined in the Investment
 Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;), considered and approved
 the continuance of the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement of the Fund
 with UBS Global Asset Management (Americas) Inc. (&#147;UBS Global AM&#148;). In
 preparing for the meeting, the board members had requested and received extensive
 information from UBS Global AM to assist them. The board received and considered
 a variety of information about UBS Global AM, as well as the advisory and administration
 arrangements for the Fund.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">The Independent Directors discussed the
 materials initially provided by management prior to the scheduled board meeting
 in a session with their independent legal counsel and requested, and received from
 management, supplemental materials to assist them in their consideration of the
 contracts. The Independent Directors also met in executive session after management&#146;s presentation was completed to review the disclosure that had been made to
 them at the meeting. At all of these sessions the Independent Directors met in session
 with their independent legal counsel. The Independent Directors also received a
 memorandum from their independent legal counsel discussing the duties of board members
 in considering approval of advisory and administration agreements.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">In its consideration of the approval of
 the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement, the board considered the following
 factors:</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Nature, extent and quality of the services
 under the investment advisory and administration agreement</b>&#151;The board received
 and considered information regarding the nature, extent and quality of advisory
 services provided to the Fund by UBS Global AM under the Investment Advisory and
 Administration Agreement during the past year. The board also considered the nature,
 extent and quality of administrative and shareholder services performed by UBS Global
 AM and its affiliates for the Fund and the resources devoted to, and the record
 of compliance with, the Fund&#146;s compliance policies and procedures. The board
 noted that it received information at regular meetings throughout the year regarding
 the services rendered by UBS Global AM concerning the management of the Fund&#146;s
 affairs and UBS Global AM&#146;s role in coordinating providers of other services
 to the Fund. The board&#146;s evaluation of the services provided</font></p>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">by UBS Global AM took into account the board&#146;s knowledge and familiarity gained as board members of funds in the UBS New
 York fund complex, including the scope and quality of UBS Global AM&#146;s investment
 advisory and other capabilities and the quality of administrative and other services.
 The board observed that the scope of services provided by UBS Global AM had expanded
 over time as a result of regulatory and other developments, including maintaining
 and monitoring its own and the Fund&#146;s expanded compliance programs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">The board had available to it the qualifications,
 backgrounds and responsibilities of the Fund&#146;s senior personnel and the portfolio
 manager primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund
 and recognized that many of these persons report to the board regularly and that
 at each regular meeting the board receives a detailed report on the Fund&#146;s
 performance. The board also considered, based on its knowledge of UBS Global AM
 and its affiliates, the financial resources available to management and its parent
 organization, UBS AG. In that regard, the board received extensive financial information
 regarding UBS Global AM and noted that it was a wholly owned, indirect subsidiary
 of one of the largest financial services firms in the world. It was also noted that
 UBS Global AM had well over $100 billion in assets under management and was part
 of the UBS Global Asset Management Division, which had well over $700 billion of
 assets under management worldwide as of March 2008. The board was also cognizant
 of, and considered, the regulatory and litigation actions and investigations occurring
 in the past year involving UBS AG, UBS Global AM and certain of their affiliates.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">The board concluded that, overall, it was
 satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of services provided (and expected
 to be provided) to the Fund under the Investment Advisory and Administration Agreement.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Advisory fees and expense ratios</b>&#151;The
 board reviewed and considered the contractual management fee (&#147;Contractual
 Management Fee&#148;) payable by the Fund to UBS Global AM in light of the nature,
 extent and quality of the advisory and administrative services provided by UBS Global
 AM. The board also reviewed and considered a fee waiver arrangement for the Fund
 and considered the actual fee rate (after taking the waiver into account) (the &#147;Actual Management Fee&#148;). Additionally, the board received and considered
 information comparing the Fund&#146;s Contractual Management Fee, Actual Management
 Fee and overall expenses with those of funds in a</font></p>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">group of funds selected and provided by
 Lipper, Inc. (&#147;Lipper&#148;), an independent provider of investment company
 data (the &#147;Expense Group&#148;).</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">In connection with its consideration of
 advisory fees for UBS funds generally, the board also received information from
 UBS Global AM with respect to standard institutional account fees. The board noted
 that, in general, these fees were lower than the Contractual Management Fee and
 Actual Management Fee for the Fund, but also noted management&#146;s explanation
 that comparisons with such accounts may be of limited relevance given the different
 structures and regulatory requirements of funds versus
 such accounts and the differences in the levels of services required by funds and
 such accounts. The board also received information on fees charged to other funds
 managed by UBS Global AM.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">The comparative Lipper information showed
 that the Fund&#146;s Contractual Management Fee and Actual Management Fee were in
 the fifth quintile, while its total expenses were in the fourth quintile in the
 Fund&#146;s Expense Group for the comparison periods utilized in the Lipper report
 (with the first quintile representing that fifth of the funds in the Expense Group
 with the lowest level of fees or expenses, as applicable, and the fifth quintile
 representing that fifth of the funds in the Expense Group with the highest level
 of fees or expenses, as applicable). Management stated that effective August 1, 2008,
 the Fund&#146;s custodian fees would be reduced from 0.05% to 0.04%. Management noted
 that under its current fee waiver agreement with the Fund, it has agreed to waive
 a portion of the advisory and administration fee so that the Fund&#146;s effective
 fee is 0.83% of average weekly net assets attributable only to holders of common
 shares and that this waiver will continue indefinitely unless the board agrees to
 any change. After discussion of the current management fees with the board, management
 stated that it would put into effect a new voluntary fee waiver for the Fund, so
 that beginning August 1, 2008, the Fund&#146;s effective management fee would be
 reduced to 0.50% of average weekly net assets attributable only to holders of common
 shares; this further reduction in fees would continue indefinitely unless the board
 agrees to any change.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">Taking all of the above into consideration,
 the board determined that the management fee was reasonable in light of the nature,
 extent and quality of the services provided to the Fund under the Investment Advisory
 and Administration Agreement.</font></p>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Fund performance</b>&#151;The board received
 and considered (a) annualized total return information of the Fund compared to other
 funds (the &#147;Performance Universe&#148;) selected by Lipper over the one-, three-,
 five-, ten-year and since inception periods ended April 30, 2008 and (b) annualized
 performance information for each year in the ten-year period ended April 30, 2008.
 The board was provided with a description of the methodology Lipper used to determine
 the similarity of the Fund with the funds included in its Performance Universe.
 The board also noted that it had received information throughout the year at periodic
 intervals with respect to the Fund&#146;s performance, including with respect to
 its benchmark index. The comparative Lipper information showed that the Fund&#146;s
 performance was in the fourth quintile for the one-year period and the fifth quintile
 for the three-, five- and ten-year periods and since inception period (with the
 first quintile representing that fifth of the funds in the Performance Universe
 with the highest performance and the fifth quintile representing that fifth of the
 funds in the Performance Universe with the lowest performance). In its review, the
 board noted the Fund&#146;s performance as compared to the average return for the
 Fund&#146;s Performance Universe and benchmark index, taking volatility into account.
 Management informed the board that the Fund benefited from implementing a bullet
 strategy (i.e., a strategy in which a portfolio is designed to have securities with
 maturities that are highly concentrated at one point on the yield curve) that took
 advantage of a steepening yield curve. Management noted, however, that although
 the Fund&#146;s duration was extended, it still was shorter than its Performance
 Universe&#146;s average. Management also noted that the Fund&#146;s performance
 is improving relative to its Performance Universe. Management reminded the board
 that historically, the Fund was managed in a more conservative manner&#151;focusing
 on higher quality credits and preservation of capital while being less aggressive
 in seeking relative outperformance. Management noted that in response to changing
 markets over the past few years, management augmented the Fund&#146;s investment
 strategy universe to provide more flexibility and to broaden asset classes and instruments
 that the Fund could invest in, resulting in more recent improved performance. At
 the Meeting, the board also discussed the possible implementation of a tender option
 bond (&#147;TOB&#148;) program as previously explored with management. Based on its
 review and management&#146;s explanation and proposed initiatives, the board concluded
 that the Fund&#146;s investment performance was acceptable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Adviser profitability</b>&#151;The board
 received and considered a profitability analysis of UBS Global AM and its affiliates
 in providing services to the Fund. The board also received profitability information
 with respect to the UBS New York fund complex as a whole. UBS Global AM&#146;s profitability
 was considered not excessive in light of the nature, extent and quality of the services
 provided to the Fund.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Economies of scale</b>&#151;The board
 received and considered information from management regarding whether there have
 been economies of scale with respect to the management of the Fund, whether the
 Fund has appropriately benefited from any economies of scale, and whether there
 is potential for realization of further economies of scale for the Fund. The board
 considered whether economies of scale in the provision of services to the Fund were
 being passed along to shareholders. The board also considered whether alternative
 fee structures (such as breakpoints) would be more appropriate or reasonable taking
 into consideration economies of scale or other efficiencies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">In conducting its review, the board noted
 that the Fund&#146;s Contractual Management Fee did not contain any breakpoints.
 Further, the board noted that advisory agreements of closed-end funds usually do
 not contain breakpoints. Management informed the board that the Fund, as a closed-end
 investment company, was not expected to materially increase in size; thus, UBS Global
 AM would not benefit from economies of scale.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">The board members considered whether economies
 of scale could be realized because UBS Global AM advises other similar funds, and,
 based on their experience, the board accepted UBS Global AM&#146;s explanation that
 significant economies of scale would not be realized because the nature of the market
 in which the Fund invests did not provide significant savings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2"><b>Other benefits to UBS Global AM</b>&#151;The
 board considered other benefits received by UBS Global AM and its affiliates as
 a result of its relationship with the Fund, including the opportunity to offer additional
 products and services to Fund shareholders.</font></p>
<p><font face="Sans-Serif" size="2">In light of the costs of providing
 investment management, administrative and other services to the Fund and UBS Global
 AM&#146;s ongoing commitment</font></p>
