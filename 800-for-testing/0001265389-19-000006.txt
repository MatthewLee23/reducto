President's Letter

Since 1928, active portfolio management based on in-depth, fundamental
research, has been the foundation of Amundi Pioneer's investment approach. We
believe an active management investment strategy is a prudent approach to
investing, especially during periods of market volatility, which can result
from any number of risk factors, including slow U.S. economic growth, rising
interest rates, and geopolitical factors. Of course, in today's global economy,
risk factors extend well beyond U.S. borders, and political and economic issues
on the international front can also cause or contribute to volatility in U.S.
markets.

At Amundi Pioneer, each security under consideration is researched by our team
of experienced investment professionals, who visit companies and meet with
their management teams. At the end of this research process, if we have
conviction in a company's business model and management team, and regard the
security as a potentially solid investment opportunity, an Amundi Pioneer
portfolio manager makes an active decision to invest in that security. The
portfolio resulting from these decisions represents an expression of his or her
convictions, and strives to balance overall risk and return opportunity. As an
example, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index -- the predominant benchmark for many
U.S. Large-Cap Core Equity funds -- has 500 stocks. An Amundi Pioneer portfolio
manager chooses to invest in only those companies that he or she believes can
offer the most attractive opportunities to pursue the fund's investment
objective, thus potentially benefiting the fund's shareowners. This process
results in a portfolio that does not own all 500 stocks, but a much narrower
universe. The same active decision to invest in a company is also applied when
we decide to sell a security, either due to changing fundamentals, valuation
concerns, or market risks. We apply this active decision-making across all of
our equity, fixed-income, and global portfolios.

Today, as investors, we have many options. It is our view that active
management can serve shareholders well not only when markets are thriving, but
also during periods of market volatility and uncertainty, thus making it a
compelling investment choice. As you consider the many choices today, we
encourage you to work with your financial advisor to develop an overall
investment plan that addresses both your short- and long-term goals, and to
implement such a plan in a disciplined manner.

Portfolio Management Discussion | 11/30/18

In the following interview, Jonathan Sharkey discusses the factors that
influenced the performance of Pioneer Floating Rate Trust during the 12-month
period ended November 30, 2018. Mr. Sharkey, a senior vice president and a
portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc., is responsible for
the day-to-day management of the Trust.

Q     How did the Trust perform during the 12-month period ended November 30,
      2018?

A     Pioneer Floating Rate Trust returned 3.34% at net asset value (NAV) and
      3.34% at market price during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2018,
      while the Trust's benchmark, the Standard & Poor's/Loan Syndications &
      Trading Association Leveraged Loan Index (the S&P/LSTA Index), returned
      3.47% at NAV. Unlike the Trust, the S&P/LSTA Index does not use leverage.
      While the use of leverage increases investment opportunity, it also
      increases investment risk.

      During the same 12-month period, the average return at NAV of the 41
      closed end funds in Morningstar's Bank Loan Closed End Funds category
      (which may or may not be leveraged), was 3.46%, and the average return at
      market price of the 41 closed end funds in the same Morningstar category
      was 0.82%.

      The shares of the Trust were selling at a 13.62% discount to NAV on
      November 30, 2018. Comparatively, the shares of the Trust were selling at
      a 7.65% discount to NAV on November 30, 2017.

      The Trust's standardized, 30-day SEC yield was 6.18% on November 30,
      2018*.

Q     How would you describe the investment environment for investing in bank
      loans during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2018?

A     Entering the 12-month period, credit-sensitive areas of the bond market,
      including bank loans, continued to be supported by positive economic data.
      (Credit-sensitive, or spread-sensitive investments, such as high-yield
      corporate bonds and bank loans, are more vulnerable to default by the
      issuer, and/or the chance that a portion of the principal and interest
      will not be paid back to investors, than interest-rate-sensitive
      investments such as U.S. Treasuries.)

      Credit-market sentiment had received a boost as 2017 drew to a close with
      the passage of a U.S. tax reform package that included a lowering of the
      corporate tax rate, a one-time opportunity for companies to repatriate
      cash

*     The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized formula that is based on the
      hypothetical annualized earning power (investment income only) of the
      Trust's portfolio securities during the period indicated.

      held overseas on favorable terms, and a window during which companies
      could accelerate the expensing of capital investments. While U.S. gross
      domestic product (GDP) growth for the first quarter of 2018 came in at a
      relatively modest 2.2%, many analysts attributed the figure to seasonal
      factors. That view was confirmed as GDP for the second and third quarters
      came in at 4.2% and 3.5%, respectively. Second-quarter earnings results
      saw already robust corporate profits surprise to the upside for most
      companies, while the unemployment rate dipped below 4%.

      In addition to a strong fundamental backdrop for the credit markets, the
      attractiveness of bank loans as an asset class benefited from a
      rising-interest-rate environment during the period. The U.S. Federal
      Reserve System (the Fed) implemented four separate one-quarter-point
      increases to the target range for its overnight lending rate over the 12
      months -- once in December 2017 and three times between January and
      September 2018. The increases put upward pressure on LIBOR reference
      rates, which are used to set the baseline for the yield on most bank
      loans. (LIBOR refers to London Interbank Offered Rate.)

      The impact of the Fed's rate hikes on loan yields was somewhat muted,
      however, as many borrowers have elected to tie payments to the one-month
      LIBOR of late, in lieu of the traditional three-month LIBOR. Increases in
      the one-month LIBOR rate were suppressed to a certain degree in the first
      half of the 12-month period, due to reduced demand for shorter-term
      investments, driven by the aforementioned 2017 tax reform legislation. The
      upward movement in loan yields was also constrained during the period by
      spread tightening and a favorable refinancing environment, as loan-market
      sentiment has been supported by a low default rate. (Loan spreads are the
      interest rates over and above the LIBOR rate charged to borrowers by
      banks.)

      Supply-and-demand factors were generally favorable for bank loans over the
      12 months. For much of the period, new issuance stood at below year-ago
      levels, while there was strong institutional demand for yield, which
      benefited loan performance. This strong demand was reflected in robust
      formation of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). In addition, retail
      loan mutual fund flows moved from negative in late 2017 to consistently
      positive as 2018 progressed; that trend began to reverse in early
      November, however, when the loan market began to see outflows.

      Against a strong fundamental backdrop for credit, lower-quality loans
      rated in the CCC and lower-B ranges generally outperformed higher-rated
      loans over the full 12-month period.

                        Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 5

<PAGE>

Q     What factors had the biggest effects on the Trust's performance relative
      to the S&P/LSTA Index during the 12-month period ended November 30, 2018?

A     The Trust's allocations across various industries and sectors were a
      modest positive factor in benchmark-relative performance for the period. A
      moderate portfolio underweight to retailers and a significant underweight
      to the business services & equipment sector were positive contributors to
      benchmark-relative returns, while a moderate overweight to food products
      and a moderate underweight to hotels & casinos detracted from the Trust's
      benchmark-relative performance.

      With regard to security selection, loans within the health care, chemical,
      and surface transport industries aided the Trust's benchmark-relative
      results, while selection within the non-ferrous metals and minerals, and
      oil & gas sectors detracted from relative performance.

      The Trust's positioning with respect to lower-quality loan rating
      categories was essentially a neutral factor in benchmark-relative results.

      Loans held in the portfolio that contributed positively to the Trust's
      benchmark-relative returns during the period were led by vitamin and
      nutritional-supplement company Alphabet Holding (aka Nature's Bounty),
      retailer PetSmart, inland marine shipping company Commercial Barge Line,
      office supply chain Staples, commercial insurance broker Confie Seguros,
      and global trade logistics firm Livingston International.

      The portfolio experienced no defaults during the 12-month period; however,
      there were some loan holdings that detracted from the Trust's
      benchmark-relative performance, including the loans to food service
      industry vendor CTI Foods, ATM and point-of-sale technology firm Diebold
      Nixdorf, in-store marketing and promotion company Catalina (aka Checkout
      Holdings), oil & gas exploration company Gavilan Resources, food
      distributor United Natural Foods, and yogurt company Chobani.

      Finally, small out-of-benchmark portfolio positions in high-yield
      corporate bonds and insurance-linked securities (ILS) -- which are issued
      by insurers to mitigate the impact of claims paid out in the wake of
      natural disasters -- detracted slightly from the Trust's
      benchmark-relative performance during the 12-month period.

Q     How did the level of leverage in the Trust change over the 12-month period
      ended November 30, 2018?

A     The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility.

      At the end of the 12-month period on November 30, 2018, 32.5% of the
      Trust's total managed assets were financed by leverage, compared with
      31.8% of the Trust's total managed assets financed by leverage at the
      start of the period on December 1, 2017. The absolute amount of funds
      borrowed

6 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18

<PAGE>

      by the Trust did not change during the period. The increase in the
      percentage of leveraged funds was the result of a reduction of the
      aggregate net asset value of the Trust's holdings.

Q     Did the Trust have any investments in derivative securities during the
      12-month period ended November 30, 2018? If so, did the derivatives have
      any material effect on benchmark-relative results?

A     We invested the Trust in high-yield bond credit-default swap indices
      during the period, principally to maintain a small basket of liquid
      investments in the portfolio that can provide short-term income on cash
      that we may invest tactically as opportunities arise. The derivatives had
      no material impact on benchmark-relative performance.

Q     Did the Trust's distributions to shareholders change during the 12-month
      period ended November 30, 2018?

A     No. The Trust's distributions were unchanged over the 12-month period.

Q     What is your investment outlook and how are you positioning the Trust's
      portfolio heading into a new fiscal year?

A     The default rate on bank loans for the 12-month period ended November 30,
      2018, was 1.61% by loan volume. This represented a 13-month low and was
      below the historical average of slightly over 3%. The default rate by
      number of issuers was 1.56%, also below the long-term average. We view
      current loan-market fundamentals as positive and expect defaults to remain
      manageable.

      At the end of November 2018, the Trust's portfolio had only a modest
      out-of-benchmark exposure to high-yield corporates, as we view the
      interest-rate environment as more favorable for bank loans. The Trust's
      portfolio also had a small position in ILS as of November 30th, based on
      the diversification** effects such securities can provide.

      We believe that bank loans have demonstrated their value in a rising-rate
      environment, as they substantially outperformed both high-yield and
      investment-grade corporate bonds over the 12-month period ended November
      30, 2018. The loan market has recently seen an uptick in the amount of
      leverage utilized in buyout activity, and we have refrained from having
      the Trust participate in a number of the more-levered deals. Our recent
      purchases have instead been focused within the broadcast, oil & gas, and
      financial intermediary loan-market segments. We are also emphasizing
      investments in the loans of borrowers with strong cash flows, which may
      help ensure that they can pay their obligations in the event interest
      rates rise meaningfully from here, or if overall conditions weaken.

**    Diversification does not assure a profit nor protect against loss.

                        Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 7

<PAGE>

      More broadly, we believe there has been a growing disconnect between the
      market's expectations for lower future GDP growth and inflation, and the
      Fed's view of the likely extent of future rate increases, as evidenced in
      its recent "dot plot" (a chart which displays the view of each Federal
      Open Market Committee member as to the direction of the federal funds rate
      in the coming two years). The weaker sentiment with respect to economic
      growth and inflation has led to the recent outflows in the loan asset
      class. As noted earlier, however, the Fed was expected to raise interest
      rates again in December, a positive factor for loans given the
      floating-rate nature of the asset class.

      We believe a December rate increase, a somewhat benign default forecast in
      the 2% to 2.5% range, and solid levels of CLO formation can provide a
      reasonably constructive backdrop for bank loans heading into 2019.

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments on pages 13-43 for a full listing
of Trust securities.

All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal.
In the past several years, financial markets have experienced increased
volatility, depressed valuations, decreased liquidity, and heightened
uncertainty. These conditions may continue, recur, worsen, or spread.

The Trust may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures and
options, for a variety of purposes, including: in an attempt to hedge against
adverse changes in the marketplace of securities, interest rates or currency
exchange rates; as a substitute for purchasing or selling securities; to
attempt to increase the Trust's return as a non-hedging strategy that may be
considered speculative; and to manage portfolio characteristics. Using
derivatives can increase fund losses and reduce opportunities for gains when
the market prices, interest rates or the derivative instruments themselves
behave in a way not anticipated by the Trust. These types of instruments can
increase price fluctuation.

The Trust is not limited in the percentage of its assets that may be invested
in floating-rate senior loans and other securities which may be less liquid or
illiquid. Illiquid securities may be difficult to sell at a price reflective of
their value at times when the Trust believes it is desirable to do so and the
market price of illiquid securities is generally more volatile than that of
more liquid securities. Illiquid securities may be difficult to value, and
investment of the Trust's assets in illiquid securities may restrict the
Trust's ability to take advantage of market opportunities.

<PAGE>

The Trust employs leverage through a revolving credit facility. Leverage
creates significant risks, including the risk that the Trust's income or
capital appreciation from investments purchased with the proceeds of leverage
will not be sufficient to cover the cost of leverage, which may adversely
affect the return for shareowners.

The Trust is required to maintain certain regulatory and other asset coverage
requirements in connection with its use of leverage. In order to maintain
required asset coverage levels, the Trust may be required to reduce the amount
of leverage employed by the Trust, alter the composition of its investment
portfolio or take other actions at what might be inopportune times in the
market. Such actions could reduce the net earnings or returns to shareowners
over time, which is likely to result in a decrease in the market value of the
Trust's shares.

Investments in high-yield or lower-rated securities are subject to
greater-than-average risk. The Trust may invest in securities of issuers that
are in default or that are in bankruptcy.

Investing in foreign and/or emerging markets securities involves risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political
conditions.

These risks may increase share price volatility.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit www.amundipioneer.com for the most recent
month-end performance results. Current performance may be lower or higher than
the performance data quoted.

Performance data shown represents past performance. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and market price will fluctuate,
and your shares may trade below NAV, due to such factors as interest rate
changes, and the perceived credit quality of borrowers.

Total investment return does not reflect broker sales charges or commissions.
All performance is for shares of the Trust.

Shares of closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously
offered. There is a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of
closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market through a stock
exchange and frequently trade at prices lower than their NAV. NAV per share is
total assets less total liabilities, which include preferred shares, or
borrowings, as applicable, divided by the number of shares outstanding.

When NAV is lower than market price, dividends are assumed to be reinvested at
the greater of NAV or 95% of the market price. When NAV is higher, dividends
are assumed to be reinvested at prices obtained through open-market purchases
under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan.

The performance table and graph do not reflect the deduction of fees and taxes
that a shareowner would pay on Trust distributions or the sale of Trust shares.
Had these fees and taxes been reflected, performance would have been lower.

Index returns are calculated monthly, assume reinvestment of dividends and,
unlike Trust returns, do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges. The
index does not use leverage. You cannot invest directly in an index.

Notes to Financial Statements | 11/30/18

1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies

Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory
trust on October 6, 2004. Prior to commencing operations on December 28, 2004,
the Trust had no operations other than matters relating to its organization and
registration as a closed-end management investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust is a diversified fund. The
investment objective of the Trust is to provide a high level of current income
and the Trust may, as a secondary objective, also seek preservation of capital
to the extent consistent with its investment objective of high current income.

Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Amundi and Amundi's wholly owned subsidiary, Amundi USA, Inc., serves as the
Trust's investment adviser (the "Adviser"). Amundi Pioneer Distributor, Inc.,
an affiliate of Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc., serves as the Trust's
distributor (the "Distributor").

In August 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") released a
Disclosure Update and Simplification Final Rule. The Final Rule amends
Regulation S-X disclosures requirements to conform them to U.S. Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ("U.S. GAAP") for investment companies. The
Trust's financial statements were prepared in compliance with the new
amendments to Regulation S-X.

The Trust is an investment company and follows investment company accounting
and reporting guidance under U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires the management of
the Trust to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of income,
expenses and gain or loss on investments during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements:

A.    Security Valuation

      The net asset value of the Trust is computed once daily, on each day the
      New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") is open, as of the close of regular
      trading on the NYSE.

      Fixed-income securities are valued by using prices supplied by independent
      pricing services, which consider such factors as market prices, market
      events, quotations from one or more brokers, Treasury spreads, yields,
      maturities and

50 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18

<PAGE>

      ratings, or may use a pricing matrix or other fair value methods or
      techniques to provide an estimated value of the security or instrument. A
      pricing matrix is a means of valuing a debt security on the basis of
      current market prices for other debt securities, historical trading
      patterns in the market for fixed-income securities and/or other factors.
      Non-U.S. debt securities that are listed on an exchange will be valued at
      the bid price obtained from an independent third party pricing service.
      When independent third party pricing services are unable to supply prices,
      or when prices or market quotations are considered to be unreliable, the
      value of that security may be determined using quotations from one or more
      broker-dealers.

      Loan interests are valued in accordance with guidelines established by the
      Board of Trustees at the mean between the last available bid and asked
      prices from one or more brokers or dealers as obtained from Loan Pricing
      Corporation, an independent third party pricing service. If price
      information is not available from Loan Pricing Corporation, or if the
      price information is deemed to be unreliable, price information will be
      obtained from an alternative loan interest pricing service. If no reliable
      price quotes are available from either the primary or alternative pricing
      service, broker quotes will be solicited.

      Event-linked bonds or catastrophe bonds are valued at the bid price
      obtained from an independent third party pricing service. Other
      insurance-linked securities (including sidecars, collateralized
      reinsurance and industry loss warranties) may be valued at the bid price
      obtained from an independent pricing service, or through a third party
      using a pricing matrix, insurance industry valuation models, or other fair
      value methods or techniques to provide an estimated value of the
      instrument.

      Equity securities that have traded on an exchange are valued by using the
      last sale price on the principal exchange where they are traded. Equity
      securities that have not traded on the date of valuation, or securities
      for which sale prices are not available, generally are valued using the
      mean between the last bid and asked prices or, if both last bid and asked
      prices are not available, at the last quoted bid price. Last sale and bid
      and asked prices are provided by independent third party pricing services.
      In the case of equity securities not traded on an exchange, prices are
      typically determined by independent third party pricing services using a
      variety of techniques and methods.

      The value of foreign securities is translated into U.S. dollars based on
      foreign currency exchange rate quotations supplied by a third party
      pricing source. Trading in non-U.S. equity securities is substantially
      completed each day at various times prior to the close of the NYSE. The
      values of such securities

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 51

<PAGE>

      used in computing the net asset value of the Trust's shares are determined
      as of such times. The Trust may use a fair value model developed by an
      independent pricing service to value non-U.S. equity securities.

      Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are valued daily using the
      foreign exchange rate or, for longer term forward contract positions, the
      spot currency rate and the forward points on a daily basis, in each case
      provided by a third party pricing service. Contracts whose forward
      settlement date falls between two quoted days are valued by interpolation.

      Swap contracts, including interest rate swaps, caps and floors (other than
      centrally cleared swap contracts) are valued at the dealer quotations
      obtained from reputable International Swap Dealers Association members.
      Centrally cleared swaps are valued at the daily settlement price provided
      by the central clearing counterparty.

      Shares of open-end registered investment companies (including money market
      mutual funds) are valued at such funds' net asset value. Shares of
      exchange-listed closed-end funds are valued by using the last sale price
      on the principal exchange where they are traded.

      Repurchase agreements are valued at par. Cash may include overnight time
      deposits at approved financial institutions.

      Securities or loan interests for which independent pricing services or
      broker-dealers are unable to supply prices or for which market prices
      and/or quotations are not readily available or are considered to be
      unreliable are valued by a fair valuation team comprised of certain
      personnel of the Adviser pursuant to procedures adopted by the Trust's
      Board of Trustees. The Adviser's fair valuation team uses fair value
      methods approved by the Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees. The
      Adviser's fair valuation team is responsible for monitoring developments
      that may impact fair valued securities and for discussing and assessing
      fair values on an ongoing basis, and at least quarterly, with the
      Valuation Committee of the Board of Trustees.

      Inputs used when applying fair value methods to value a security may
      include credit ratings, the financial condition of the company, current
      market conditions and comparable securities. The Trust may use fair value
      methods if it is determined that a significant event has occurred after
      the close of the exchange or market on which the security trades and prior
      to the determination of the Trust's net asset value. Examples of a
      significant event might include political or economic news, corporate
      restructurings, natural disasters, terrorist activity or trading halts.
      Thus, the valuation of the Trust's securities may differ significantly
      from exchange prices, and such differences could be material.

52 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18

<PAGE>

      At November 30, 2018, three securities were valued using fair value
      methods (in addition to securities valued using prices supplied by
      independent pricing services, broker-dealers or using a third party
      insurance pricing model) representing 0.30% of net assets. The value of
      these fair valued securities was $884,850.

B.    Investment Income and Transactions

      Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain
      dividends from foreign securities where the ex-dividend date may have
      passed are recorded as soon as the Trust becomes aware of the ex-dividend
      data in the exercise of reasonable diligence.

      Interest income, including interest on income-bearing cash accounts, is
      recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend and interest income are reported
      net of unrecoverable foreign taxes withheld at the applicable country
      rates and net of income accrued on defaulted securities.

      Interest and dividend income payable by delivery of additional shares is
      reclassified as PIK (payment-in-kind) income upon receipt and is included
      in interest and dividend income, respectively.

      All discounts/premiums on purchase prices of debt securities are
      accreted/amortized for financial reporting purposes over the life of the
      respective securities, and such accretion/amortization is included in
      interest income.

      Security transactions are recorded as of trade date. Gains and losses on
      sales of investments are calculated on the identified cost method for both
      financial reporting and federal income tax purposes.

C.    Foreign Currency Translation

      The books and records of the Trust are maintained in U.S. dollars. Amounts
      denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using
      current exchange rates.

      Net realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, if any,
      represent, among other things, the net realized gains and losses on
      foreign currency contracts, disposition of foreign currencies and the
      difference between the amount of income accrued and the U.S. dollars
      actually received. Further, the effects of changes in foreign currency
      exchange rates on investments are not segregated on the Statement of
      Operations from the effects of changes in the market prices of those
      securities, but are included with the net realized and unrealized gain or
      loss on investments.

<PAGE>

D.    Federal Income Taxes

      It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal
      Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
      distribute all of its net taxable income and net realized capital gains,
      if any, to its shareowners. Therefore, no provision for federal income
      taxes is required. As of November 30, 2018, the Trust did not accrue any
      interest or penalties with respect to uncertain tax positions, which, if
      applicable, would be recorded as an income tax expense on the Statement of
      Operations. Tax returns filed within the prior three years remain subject
      to examination by federal and state tax authorities.

      The amount and character of income and capital gain distributions to
      shareowners are determined in accordance with federal income tax rules,
      which may differ from U.S. GAAP. Distributions in excess of net investment
      income or net realized gains are temporary over distributions for
      financial statement purposes resulting from differences in the recognition
      or classification of income or distributions for financial statement and
      tax purposes. Capital accounts within the financial statements are
      adjusted for permanent book/tax differences to reflect tax character, but
      are not adjusted for temporary differences.

      At November 30, 2018, the Trust reclassified $11,415,660 to decrease
      paid-in capital and $11,415,660 to decrease distributable loss, to reflect
      permanent book/tax differences. These adjustments have no impact on net
      assets or the results of operations.

      At November 30, 2018, the Trust was permitted to carry forward $1,195,553
      of short-term capital losses and $35,790,598 of long-term capital losses
      without limitation. Additionally, at November 30, 2018, the Trust had a
      net capital loss carryforward of $18,747,865 that will expire in 2019, if
      not utilized. Since unlimited losses are required to be used first, loss
      carryforwards that are subject to expiration may be more likely to expire
      unused. The amount of capital loss carryforward that expired unused in
      2018 was $11,415,660.

      The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended November
      30, 2018 and November 30, 2017, were as follows:

E.    Risks

      The value of securities held by the Trust may go up or down, sometimes
      rapidly or unpredictably, due to general market conditions, such as real
      or perceived adverse economic, political or regulatory conditions,
      inflation, changes in interest rates, lack of liquidity in the bond
      markets or adverse investor sentiment. In the past several years,
      financial markets have experienced increased volatility, depressed
      valuations, decreased liquidity and heightened uncertainty. These
      conditions may continue, recur, worsen or spread.

      At times, the Trust's investments may represent industries or industry
      sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making the Trust more
      susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or
      other risks affecting those industries and sectors. The Trust's
      investments in countries with emerging (or developing) markets may subject
      the Trust to a greater degree of risk than investments in a developed
      market. These risks include disruptive political or economic conditions
      and the imposition of adverse governmental laws or currency exchange
      restrictions.

      Interest rates in the U.S. have been historically low and have begun to
      rise, so the Trust faces a heightened risk that interest rates may
      continue to rise. A general rise in interest rates could adversely affect
      the price and liquidity of fixed-income securities and could also result
      in increased redemptions from the Trust.

      The Trust invests in below investment grade (high yield) debt securities
      and preferred stocks. Some of these high yield securities may be
      convertible into equity securities of the issuer. Debt securities rated
      below investment grade are commonly referred to as "junk bonds" and are
      considered speculative.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 55

<PAGE>

      These securities involve greater risk of loss, are subject to greater
      price volatility, and are less liquid, especially during periods of
      economic uncertainty or change, than higher rated debt securities.

      With the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct
      business, the Trust is susceptible to operational, information security
      and related risks. While the Trust's Adviser has established business
      continuity plans in the event of, and risk management systems to prevent,
      limit or mitigate, such cyber-attacks, there are inherent limitations in
      such plans and systems including the possibility that certain risks have
      not been identified. Furthermore, the Trust cannot control the
      cybersecurity plans and systems put in place by service providers to the
      Trust such as Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., the Trust's custodian and
      accounting agent, and American Stock & Trust Company ("AST"), the Trust's
      transfer agent. In addition, many beneficial owners of Trust shares hold
      them through accounts at broker-dealers, retirement platforms and other
      financial market participants over which neither the Trust nor Amundi
      Pioneer exercises control. Each of these may in turn rely on service
      providers to them, which are also subject to the risk of cyber-attacks.
      Cybersecurity failures or breaches at Amundi Pioneer or the Trust's
      service providers or intermediaries have the ability to cause disruptions
      and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses,
      interference with the Trust's ability to calculate its net asset value,
      impediments to trading, the inability of Trust shareowners to effect share
      purchases or receive distributions, loss of or unauthorized access to
      private shareowners information and violations of applicable privacy and
      other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, or
      additional compliance costs. Such costs and losses may not be covered
      under any insurance. In addition, maintaining vigilance against
      cyber-attacks may involve substantial costs over time, and system
      enhancements may themselves be subject to cyber-attacks.

F.    Insurance-Linked Securities ("ILS")

      The Trust invests in event-linked bonds and other ILS. The Trust could
      lose a portion or all of the principal it has invested in an ILS, and the
      right to additional interest payments with respect to the security, upon
      the occurrence of one or more trigger events, as defined within the terms
      of an insurance-linked security. Trigger events, generally, are
      hurricanes, earthquakes, or other natural events of a specific size or
      magnitude that occur in a designated geographic region during a specified
      time period, and/or that involve losses or other metrics that exceed a
      specific amount. There is no way to accurately predict whether a trigger
      event will occur and, accordingly, ILS carry significant risk. The Trust
      is entitled to receive principal and interest payments so long as no
      trigger event occurs of the description and magnitude specified by the
      instrument. In addition to the specified trigger events, ILS

56 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18

<PAGE>

      may expose the Trust to other risks, including but not limited to issuer
      (credit) default, adverse regulatory or jurisdictional interpretations and
      adverse tax consequences.

      The Trust's investments in ILS may include special purpose vehicles
      ("SPVs") or similar instruments structured to comprise a portion of a
      reinsurer's catastrophe-oriented business, known as quota share
      instruments (sometimes referred to as reinsurance sidecars), or to provide
      reinsurance relating to specific risks to insurance or reinsurance
      companies through a collateralized instrument, known as collateralized
      reinsurance. Structured reinsurance investments also may include industry
      loss warranties ("ILWs"). A traditional ILW takes the form of a bilateral
      reinsurance contract, but there are also products that take the form of
      derivatives, collateralized structures, or exchange-traded instruments.

      Where the ILS are based on the performance of underlying reinsurance
      contracts, the Trust has limited transparency into the individual
      underlying contracts, and therefore must rely upon the risk assessment and
      sound underwriting practices of the issuer. Accordingly, it may be more
      difficult for the Adviser to fully evaluate the underlying risk profile of
      the Trust's structured reinsurance investments, and therefore the Trust's
      assets are placed at greater risk of loss than if the Adviser had more
      complete information. Structured reinsurance instruments generally will be
      considered illiquid securities by the Trust. These securities may be
      difficult to purchase, sell or unwind. Illiquid securities also may be
      difficult to value. If the Trust is forced to sell an illiquid asset, the
      Trust may be forced to sell at a loss.

G.    Repurchase Agreements

      Repurchase agreements are arrangements under which the Trust purchases
      securities from a broker-dealer or a bank, called the counterparty, upon
      the agreement of the counterparty to repurchase the securities from the
      Trust at a later date, and at a specific price, which is typically higher
      than the purchase price paid by the Trust. The securities purchased serve
      as the Trust's collateral for the obligation of the counterparty to
      repurchase the securities. The value of the collateral, including accrued
      interest, is required to be equal to or in excess of the repurchase price.
      The collateral for all repurchase agreements is held in safekeeping in the
      customer-only account of the Trust's custodian or a sub-custodian of the
      Trust. The Adviser is responsible for determining that the value of the
      collateral remains at least equal to the repurchase price. In the event of
      a default by the counterparty, the Trust is entitled to sell the
      securities, but the Trust may not be able to sell them for the price at
      which they were purchased, thus causing a loss to the Trust. Additionally,
      if the counterparty becomes insolvent, there is some risk that the Trust
      will not have a right to the securities, or the immediate right to sell
      the securities.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 57

<PAGE>

      Open repurchase agreements as of November 30, 2018 are disclosed in the
      Trust's Schedule of Investments.

H.    Forward Foreign Currency Contracts

      The Trust may enter into forward foreign currency contracts ("contracts")
      for the purchase or sale of a specific foreign currency at a fixed price
      on a future date. All contracts are marked to market daily at the
      applicable exchange rates, and any resulting unrealized appreciation or
      depreciation is recorded in the Trust's financial statements. The Trust
      records realized gains and losses at the time a contract is offset by
      entry into a closing transaction or extinguished by delivery of the
      currency. Risks may arise upon entering into these contracts from the
      potential inability of counterparties to meet the terms of the contract
      and from unanticipated movements in the value of foreign currencies
      relative to the U.S. dollar (see Note 4).

      At November 30, 2018, the Trust had entered into various forward foreign
      currency contracts that obligated the Trust to deliver or take delivery of
      currencies at specified future maturity dates. Alternatively, prior to the
      settlement date of a forward foreign currency contract, the Trust may
      close out such contract by entering into an offsetting contract.

      The average market value of forward foreign currency contracts open during
      the year ended November 30, 2018, was $(170,638). There were no open
      forward foreign currency contracts at November 30, 2018.

I.    Credit Default Swap Contracts

      A credit default swap is a contract between a buyer of protection and a
      seller of protection against a pre-defined credit event or an underlying
      reference obligation, which may be a single security or a basket or index
      of securities. The Trust may buy or sell credit default swap contracts to
      seek to increase the Trust's income, or to attempt to hedge the risk of
      default on portfolio securities. A credit default swap index is used to
      hedge risk or take a position on a basket of credit entities or indices.

      As a seller of protection, the Trust would be required to pay the notional
      (or other agreed-upon) value of the referenced debt obligation to the
      counterparty in the event of a default by a U.S. or foreign corporate
      issuer of a debt obligation, which would likely result in a loss to the
      Trust. In return, the Trust would receive from the counterparty a periodic
      stream of payments during the term of the contract, provided that no event
      of default occurred. The maximum exposure of loss to the seller would be
      the notional value of the credit default swaps outstanding. If no default
      occurs, the Trust would keep the stream of payments and would have no
      payment obligation. The

58 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18

<PAGE>

      Trust may also buy credit default swap contracts in order to hedge against
      the risk of default of debt securities, in which case the Trust would
      function as the counterparty referenced above.

      As a buyer of protection, the Trust makes an upfront or periodic payment
      to the protection seller in exchange for the right to receive a contingent
      payment. An upfront payment made by the Trust, as the protection buyer, is
      recorded within the "Swap contracts, at value" line item on the Statement
      of Assets and Liabilities. Periodic payments received or paid by the Trust
      are recorded as realized gains or losses on the Statement of Operations.

      Credit default swap contracts are marked-to-market daily using valuations
      supplied by independent sources and the change in value, if any, is
      recorded within the "Swap contracts, at value" line item on the Statement
      of Assets and Liabilities. Payments received or made as a result of a
      credit event or upon termination of the contract are recognized, net of
      the appropriate amount of the upfront payment, as realized gains or losses
      on the Statement of Operations.

      Credit default swap contracts involving the sale of protection may involve
      greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the referenced debt
      instrument directly. Credit default swap contracts are subject to general
      market risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk. If the
      Trust is a protection buyer and no credit event occurs, it will lose its
      investment. If the Trust is a protection seller and a credit event occurs,
      the value of the referenced debt instrument received by the Trust,
      together with the periodic payments received, may be less than the amount
      the Trust pays to the protection buyer, resulting in a loss to the Trust.
      In addition, obligations under sell protection credit default swaps may be
      partially offset by net amounts received from settlement of buy protection
      credit default swaps entered into by the Trust for the same reference
      obligation with the same counterparty.

      Certain swap contracts that are cleared through a central clearinghouse
      are referred to as centrally cleared swaps. All payments made or received
      by the Trust are pursuant to a centrally cleared swap contract with the
      central clearing party rather than the original counterparty. Upon
      entering into a centrally cleared swap contract, the Trust is required to
      make an initial margin deposit, either in cash or in securities. The daily
      change in value on open centrally cleared contracts is recorded as
      "Variation margin for centrally cleared swaps" on the Statement of Assets
      and Liabilities. Cash received from or paid to the broker related to
      previous margin movement is held in a segregated account at the broker and
      is recorded as either "Due from broker for swaps" or "Due to broker for
      swaps" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The amount of cash
      deposited with a broker as collateral at November 30, 2018, is recorded as
      "Swaps collateral" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 59

<PAGE>

      The average market value of credit default swap contracts open during the
      year ended November 30, 2018 was $130,118. Open credit default swap
      contracts at November 30, 2018 are listed in the Schedule of Investments.

J.    Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan

      All shareowners whose shares are registered in their own names
      automatically participate in the Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the
      "Plan"), under which participants receive all dividends and capital gain
      distributions (collectively, dividends) in full and fractional shares of
      the Trust in lieu of cash. Shareowners may elect not to participate in the
      Plan. Shareowners not participating in the Plan receive all dividends and
      capital gain distributions in cash. Participation in the Plan is
      completely voluntary and may be terminated or resumed at any time without
      penalty by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the agent
      for shareowners in administering the Plan (the "Plan Agent"), in writing
      prior to any dividend record date; otherwise such termination or
      resumption will be effective with respect to any subsequently declared
      dividend or other distribution.

      If a shareowner's shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank or
      other nominee, the shareowner can ask the firm or nominee to participate
      in the Plan on the shareowner's behalf. If the firm or nominee does not
      offer the Plan, dividends will be paid in cash to the shareowner of
      record. A firm or nominee may reinvest a shareowner's cash dividends in
      shares of the Trust on terms that differ from the terms of the Plan.

      Whenever the Trust declares a dividend on shares payable in cash,
      participants in the Plan will receive the equivalent in shares acquired by
      the Plan Agent either (i) through receipt of additional unissued but
      authorized shares from the Trust or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares
      on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere. If, on the payment date for
      any dividend, the net asset value per share is equal to or less than the
      market price per share plus estimated brokerage trading fees (market
      premium), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued
      shares. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to each account
      will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the
      net asset value per share on the date the shares are issued, provided that
      the maximum discount from the then current market price per share on the
      date of issuance does not exceed 5%. If, on the payment date for any
      dividend, the net asset value per share is greater than the market value
      (market discount), the Plan Agent will invest the dividend amount in
      shares acquired in open-market purchases. There are no brokerage charges
      with respect to newly issued shares. However, each participant will pay a
      pro rata share of brokerage trading fees incurred with respect to the Plan
      Agent's open-market purchases. Participating in the Plan

60 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18

<PAGE>

      does not relieve shareowners from any federal, state or local taxes which
      may be due on dividends paid in any taxable year. Shareowners holding Plan
      shares in a brokerage account may be able to transfer the shares to
      another broker and continue to participate in the Plan.

2. Management Agreement

The Adviser manages the Trust's portfolio. Management fees payable under the
Trust's Advisory Agreement with the Adviser are calculated daily at the annual
rate of 0.70% of the Trust's average daily managed assets. "Managed assets"
means (a) the total assets of the Trust, including any form of investment
leverage, minus (b) all accrued liabilities incurred in the normal course of
operations, which shall not include any liabilities or obligations attributable
to investment leverage obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type
(including, without limitation, borrowing through a credit facility or the
issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred stock or other
similar preference securities, and/or (iii) any other means. For the year ended
November 30, 2018 the net management fee was 0.70% of the Trust's average daily
managed assets, which was equivalent to 1.03% of the Trust's average daily net
assets.

In addition, under the management and administration agreements, certain other
services and costs, including accounting, regulatory reporting and insurance
premiums, are paid by the Trust as administrative reimbursements. Included in
"Due to affiliates" reflected on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities is
$16,435 in management fees, administrative costs and certain other
reimbursements payable to the Adviser at November 30, 2018.

3. Transfer Agent

AST serves as the transfer agent with respect to the Trust's common shares. The
Trust pays AST an annual fee, as is agreed to from time to time by the Trust
and AST, for providing such services.

In addition, the Trust reimbursed the transfer agent for out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the transfer agent related to shareowner communications activities
such as proxy and statement mailings and outgoing calls.

4. Additional Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

The Trust's use of derivatives may enhance or mitigate the Trust's exposure to
the following risks:

Interest rate risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of interest-bearing
securities due to changes in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 61

<PAGE>

Credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer of a financial instrument to
make further principal or interest payments on an obligation or commitment that
it has to the Trust.

Foreign exchange rate risk relates to fluctuations in the value of an asset or
liability due to changes in currency exchange rates.

Equity risk relates to the fluctuations in the value of financial instruments
as a result of changes in market prices (other than those arising from interest
rate risk or foreign exchange rate risk), whether caused by factors specific to
an individual investment, its issuer, or all factors affecting all instruments
traded in a market or market segment.

Commodity risk relates to the risk that the value of a commodity or commodity
index will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in the commodities market
and factors specific to a particular industry or commodity.

5. Unfunded Loan Commitments

The Trust may enter into unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded loan commitments
may be partially or wholly unfunded. During the contractual period, the Trust
is obliged to provide funding to the borrower upon demand. A fee is earned by
the Trust on the unfunded commitment and is recorded as interest income on the
Statement of Operations.

As of November 30, 2018, the Trust had the following unfunded loan commitments
outstanding:

7. Credit Agreement

Effective November 26, 2013, the Trust entered into a Revolving Credit Facility
(the "Credit Agreement") with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the amount of
$160,000,000. The Credit Agreement was established in conjunction with the

November 23, 2016, the Trust extended the maturity of the Credit Agreement to
November 22, 2019.

At November 30, 2018, the Trust had a borrowing outstanding under the Credit
Agreement totaling $143,450,000. The interest rate charged at November 30, 2018
was 3.31%. During the year ended November 30, 2018, the average daily balance
was $143,450,000 at an average interest rate of 2.88% . Interest expense of
$4,134,125 in connection with the Credit Agreement is included on the Statement
of Operations.

The Trust is required to maintain 300% asset coverage with respect to amounts
outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Asset coverage is calculated by
subtracting the Trust's total liabilities not including any bank loans and
senior securities, from the Trust's total assets and dividing such amount by
the principal amount of the borrowing outstanding.

8. Subsequent Events

A monthly dividend was declared on December 3, 2018 from undistributed and
accumulated net investment income of $0.0600 per share payable December 20,
2018, to shareowners of record on December 13, 2018.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Trustees and the Shareholders of
Pioneer Floating Rate Trust:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Pioneer
Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust"), including the schedule of investments, as of
November 30, 2018, and the related statements of operations, changes in net
assets and the financial highlights for the year then ended and the related
notes, and the statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights for
the year ended November 30, 2017 (collectively referred to as the "financial
statements"). The financial highlights for periods ended November 30, 2014,
November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2016 were audited by another independent
registered public accounting firm whose report, dated January 25, 2017,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial highlights. In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Trust at November 30, 2018, the results of its
operations, the changes in its net assets, and the financial highlights for the
year ended, and the statement of changes in net assets and financial highlights
for the year ended November 30, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust's financial statements
based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required
to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 65

<PAGE>

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and
performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities
owned as of November 30, 2018, by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

                                                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

We have served as the Trust's auditor since 2017.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

During the period, there have been no material changes in the Trust's
investment objective or fundamental policies that have not been approved by the
shareowners. There have been no changes in the Trust's charter or By-Laws that
would delay or prevent a change in control of the Trust which has not been
approved by the shareowners. During the period, there have been no changes in
the principal risk factors associated with investment in the Trust. There were
no changes in the persons who are primarily responsible for the day-to-day
management of the Trust's portfolio.

Notice is hereby given in accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 that the Trust may purchase, from time to time, its common
shares in the open market.

The percentages of the Fund's ordinary income distributions that are exempt
from nonresident alien (NRA) tax withholding resulting from qualified interest
income was 96.35%.

Change in Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Prior to July 3, 2017 Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("the Adviser"), the
Trust's investment adviser, was an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of
UniCredit S.p.A. ("UniCredit"). On that date, UniCredit completed the sale of
its Pioneer Investments business, which includes the Adviser, to Amundi (the
"Transaction"). As a result of the Transaction, the Adviser became an indirect,
wholly owned subsidiary of Amundi. Amundi is controlled by Credit Agricole S.A.
Amundi is headquartered in Paris, France, and, as of September 30, 2016, had
more than $1.1 trillion in assets under management worldwide.

Deloitte & Touche LLP ("D&T"), the Trust's previous independent registered
public accounting firm, informed the Audit Committee and the Board that it
would no longer be independent with respect to the Trust upon the completion of
the Transaction as a result of certain services being provided to Amundi and
Credit Agricole, and, accordingly, that it intended to resign as the Trust's
independent registered public accounting firm upon the completion of the
Transaction. D&T's resignation was effective on July 3, 2017, when the
Transaction was completed.

During the periods as to which D&T has served as the Trust's independent
registered public accounting firm, D&T's reports on the Trust's financial
statements have not contained an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and
have not been qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. Further, there have been no disagreements with D&T on
any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of D&T, would have caused D&T to make reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement in connection with its report on the financial

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 67

<PAGE>

statements. In addition, there have been no reportable events of the kind
described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.

Effective immediately following the completion of the Transaction on July 3,
2017, the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, engaged
an independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP ("EY").

Prior to its engagement, EY had advised the Trust's Audit Committee that EY had
identified the following matters, in each case relating to services rendered by
other member firms of Ernst & Young Global Limited, all of which are located
outside the United States, to UniCredit and certain of its subsidiaries during
the period commencing July 1, 2016, that it determined to be inconsistent with
the auditor independence rules set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"): (a) project management support services to UniCredit in the
Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Serbia and Slovenia in relation to twenty-two
projects, that were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(vi) of
Regulation S-X (management functions); (b) two engagements for UniCredit in
Italy where fees were contingent/success based and that were determined to be
inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(5) of Regulation S-X (contingent fees); (c) four
engagements where legal and expert services were provided to UniCredit in the
Czech Republic and Germany, and twenty engagements where the legal advisory
services were provided to UniCredit in Austria, Czech Republic, Italy and
Poland, that were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(ix) and
(x) of Regulation S-X (legal and expert services); and (d) two engagements for
UniCredit in Italy involving assistance in the sale of certain assets, that
were determined to be inconsistent with Rule 2-01(c)(4)(viii) of Regulation S-X
(broker-dealer, investment adviser or investment banking services). None of the
foregoing services involved the Trust, any of the other funds in the Pioneer
Family of Funds or any other Pioneer entity sold by UniCredit in the
Transaction.

EY advised the Audit Committee that it had considered the matters described
above and had concluded that such matters would not impair EY's ability to
exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the
financial statements of the Trust under the SEC and Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board independence rules, and that a reasonable investor with
knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would reach the same
conclusion. Management and the Audit Committee considered these matters and
discussed the matters with EY and, based upon EY's description of the matters
and statements made by EY, Management and the Audit Committee believe that EY
will be capable of exercising objective and impartial judgment in connection
with the audits of the financial statements of the Trust, and Management
further believes that a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant
facts and circumstances would reach the same conclusion.

Approval of Investment Management Agreement

Amundi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc. ("APAM") serves as the investment adviser
to Pioneer Floating Rate Trust (the "Trust") pursuant to an investment
management agreement between APAM and the Trust. In order for APAM to remain
the investment adviser of the Trust, the Trustees of the Trust must determine
annually whether to renew the investment management agreement for the Trust.

The contract review process began in January 2018 as the Trustees of the Trust
agreed on, among other things, an overall approach and timeline for the
process. Contract review materials were provided to the Trustees in March 2018,
July 2018 and September 2018.In addition, the Trustees reviewed and discussed
the Trust's performance at regularly scheduled meetings throughout the year,
and took into account other information related to the Trust provided to the
Trustees at regularly scheduled meetings, in connection with the review of the
Trust's investment management agreement.

In March 2018, the Trustees, among other things, discussed the memorandum
provided by Fund counsel that summarized the legal standards and other
considerations that are relevant to the Trustees in their deliberations
regarding the renewal of the investment management agreement, and reviewed and
discussed the qualifications of the investment management teams for the Trust,
as well as the level of investment by the Trust's portfolio managers in the
Trust. In July 2018, the Trustees, among other things, reviewed the Trust's
management fees and total expense ratios, the financial statements of APAM and
its parent companies, profitability analyses provided by APAM, and analyses
from APAM as to possible economies of scale. The Trustees also reviewed the
profitability of the institutional business of APAM and APAM's affiliate,
Amundi Pioneer Institutional Asset Management, Inc. ("APIAM" and, together with
APAM, "Amundi Pioneer"), as compared to that of APAM's fund management
business, and considered the differences between the fees and expenses of the
Trust and the fees and expenses of APAM's and APIAM's institutional accounts,
as well as the different services provided by APAM to the Trust and by APAM and
APIAM to the institutional accounts. The Trustees further considered contract
review materials, including additional materials received in response to the
Trustees' request, in September 2018.

At a meeting held on September 18, 2018, based on their evaluation of the
information provided by APAM and third parties, the Trustees of the Trust,
including the Independent Trustees voting separately, unanimously approved the
renewal of the investment management agreement for another year. In approving
the renewal of the investment management agreement, the Trustees

70 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18

<PAGE>

considered various factors that they determined were relevant, including the
factors described below. The Trustees did not identify any single factor as the
controlling factor in determining to approve the renewal of the agreement.

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services

The Trustees considered the nature, extent and quality of the services that had
been provided by APAM to the Trust, taking into account the investment
objective and strategy of the Trust. The Trustees also reviewed APAM's
investment approach for the Trust and its research process. The Trustees
considered the resources of APAM and the personnel of APAM who provide
investment management services to the Trust. They also reviewed the amount of
non-Trust assets managed by the portfolio managers of the Trust. They
considered the non-investment resources and personnel of APAM that are involved
in APAM's services to the Trust, including APAM's compliance, risk management,
and legal resources and personnel. The Trustees noted the substantial attention
and high priority given by APAM's senior management to the Pioneer Fund
complex.

The Trustees considered that APAM supervises and monitors the performance of
the Trust's service providers and provides the Trust with personnel (including
Trust officers) and other resources that are necessary for the Trust's business
management and operations. The Trustees also considered that, as administrator,
APAM is responsible for the administration of the Trust's business and other
affairs. The Trustees considered the fees paid to APAM for the provision of
administration services.

Based on these considerations, the Trustees concluded that the nature, extent
and quality of services that had been provided by APAM to the Trust were
satisfactory and consistent with the terms of the investment management
agreement.

Performance of the Trust

In considering the Trust's performance, the Trustees regularly review and
discuss throughout the year data prepared by APAM and information comparing the
Trust's performance with the performance of its peer group of funds, as
classified by Morningstar, Inc. (Morningstar), and the performance of the
Trust's benchmark index. They also discuss the Trust's performance with APAM on
a regular basis. The Trustees' regular reviews and discussions were factored
into the Trustees' deliberations concerning the renewal of the investment
management agreement.

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 71

<PAGE>

Management Fee and Expenses

The Trustees considered information showing the fees and expenses of the Trust
in comparison to the management fees and expense ratios of a peer group of
funds selected on the basis of criteria determined by the Independent Trustees
for this purpose using data provided by Strategic Insight Mutual Fund Research
and Consulting, LLC (Strategic Insight), an independent third party. The peer
group comparisons referred to below are organized in quintiles. Each quintile
represents one-fifth of the peer group. In all peer group comparisons referred
to below, first quintile is most favorable to the Trust's shareowners.

The Trustees considered that the Trust's management fee (based on managed
assets) for the most recent fiscal year was in the first quintile relative to
the management fees paid by other funds in its Strategic Insight peer group for
the comparable period. The Trustees considered that the expense ratio (based on
managed assets) of the Trust's common shares for the most recent fiscal year
was in the second quintile relative to its Strategic Insight peer group for the
comparable period.

The Trustees reviewed management fees charged by APAM and APIAM to
institutional and other clients, including publicly offered European funds
sponsored by APAM's affiliates, unaffiliated U.S. registered investment
companies (in a sub-advisory capacity), and unaffiliated foreign and domestic
separate accounts. The Trustees also considered APAM's costs in providing
services to the Trust and APAM's and APIAM's costs in providing services to the
other clients and considered the differences in management fees and profit
margins for fund and non-fund services. In evaluating the fees associated with
APAM's and APIAM's client accounts, the Trustees took into account the
respective demands, resources and complexity associated with the Trust and
other client accounts. The Trustees noted that, in some instances, the fee
rates for those clients were lower than the management fee for the Trust and
considered that, under the investment management agreement with the Trust, APAM
performs additional services for the Trust that it does not provide to those
other clients or services that are broader in scope, including oversight of the
Trust's other service providers and activities related to compliance and the
extensive regulatory and tax regimes to which the Trust is subject. The
Trustees also considered the entrepreneurial risks associated with APAM's
management of the Trust.

The Trustees concluded that the management fee payable by the Trust to APAM was
reasonable in relation to the nature and quality of the services provided by
APAM.

72 Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18

<PAGE>

Profitability

The Trustees considered information provided by APAM regarding the
profitability of APAM with respect to the advisory services provided by APAM to
the Trust, including the methodology used by APAM in allocating certain of its
costs to the management of the Trust. The Trustees also considered APAM's
profit margin in connection with the overall operation of the Trust. They
further reviewed the financial results, including the profit margins, realized
by APAM and APIAM from non-fund businesses. The Trustees considered APAM's
profit margins in comparison to the limited industry data available and noted
that the profitability of any adviser was affected by numerous factors,
including its organizational structure and method for allocating expenses. The
Trustees concluded that APAM's profitability with respect to the management of
the Trust was not unreasonable.

Economies of Scale

The Trustees considered the extent to which APAM may realize economies of scale
or other efficiencies in managing and supporting the Trust. Since the Trust is
a closed-end fund that has not raised additional capital, the Trustees
concluded that economies of scale were not a relevant consideration in the
renewal of the investment advisory agreement.

Other Benefits

The Trustees considered the other benefits that APAM enjoys from its
relationship with the Trust. The Trustees considered the character and amount
of fees paid or to be paid by the Trust, other than under the investment
management agreement, for services provided by APAM and its affiliates. The
Trustees further considered the revenues and profitability of APAM's businesses
other than the Fund business. To the extent applicable, the Trustees also
considered the benefits to the Trust and to APAM and its affiliates from the
use of "soft" commission dollars generated by the Trust to pay for research and
brokerage services.

The Trustees considered that Amundi Pioneer is the principal U.S. asset
management business of Amundi, which is one of the largest asset managers
globally. Amundi's worldwide asset management business manages over $1.7
trillion in assets (including the Pioneer Funds). The Trustees considered
that APAM's relationship with Amundi creates potential opportunities for APAM,
APIAM and Amundi that derive from APAM's relationships with the Trust,
including Amundi's ability to market the services of APAM globally. The
Trustees noted that APAM has access to additional research and portfolio
management capabilities as a result of its relationship with Amundi and
Amundi's enhanced global presence that may contribute to an increase in the
resources available to APAM. The Trustees considered that APAM and the

                       Pioneer Floating Rate Trust | Annual Report | 11/30/18 73

<PAGE>

Trust receive reciprocal intangible benefits from the relationship, including
mutual brand recognition and, for the Trust, direct and indirect access to the
resources of a large global asset manager. The Trustees concluded that any such
benefits received by APAM as a result of its relationship with the Trust were
reasonable.

Conclusion

After consideration of the factors described above as well as other factors,
the Trustees, including the Independent Trustees, concluded that the investment
management agreement for the Trust, including the fees payable thereunder, was
fair and reasonable and voted to approve the proposed renewal of the investment
management agreement.

 PIONEER FUNDS
            APPROVAL OF AUDIT, AUDIT-RELATED, TAX AND OTHER SERVICES
                       PROVIDED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR

                  SECTION I - POLICY PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY

The Pioneer Funds recognize the importance of maintaining the independence of
their outside auditors. Maintaining independence is a shared responsibility
involving Amudi Pioneer Asset Management, Inc, the audit committee and
the independent auditors.

The Funds recognize that a Fund's independent auditors: 1) possess knowledge of
the Funds, 2) are able to incorporate certain services into the scope of the
audit, thereby avoiding redundant work, cost and disruption of Fund personnel
and processes, and 3) have expertise that has value to the Funds. As a result,
there are situations where it is desirable to use the Fund's independent
auditors for services in addition to the annual audit and where the potential
for conflicts of interests are minimal. Consequently, this policy, which is
intended to comply with Rule 210.2-01(C)(7), sets forth guidelines and
procedures to be followed by the Funds when retaining the independent audit firm
to perform audit, audit-related tax and other services under those
circumstances, while also maintaining independence.

Approval of a service in accordance with this policy for a Fund shall also
constitute approval for any other Fund whose pre-approval is required pursuant
to Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(ii).

In addition to the procedures set forth in this policy, any non-audit services
that may be provided consistently with Rule 210.2-01 may be approved by the
Audit Committee itself and any pre-approval that may be waived in accordance
with Rule 210.2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) is hereby waived.

Selection of a Fund's independent auditors and their compensation shall be
determined by the Audit Committee and shall not be subject to this policy.

GENERAL AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL POLICY:
o For all projects, the officers of the Funds and the Fund's auditors will each
  make an assessment to determine that any proposed projects will not impair
  independence.

o Potential services will be classified into the four non-restricted service
  categories and the "Approval of Audit, Audit-Related, Tax and Other
  Services" Policy above will be applied. Any services outside the specific
  pre-approved service subcategories set forth above must be specifically
  approved by the Audit Committee.

o At least quarterly, the Audit Committee shall review a report summarizing the
  services by service category, including fees, provided by the Audit firm as
  set forth in the above policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    (2) Disclose the percentage of services described in each of paragraphs (b)
   through (d) of this Item that were approved by the audit committee pursuant
   to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

Non-Audit Services
Beginning with non-audit service contracts entered
into on or after May 6, 2003, the effective date of the
new SEC pre-approval rules, the Trust's audit
committee is required to pre-approve services to
affiliates defined by SEC rules to the extent that the
services are determined to have a direct impact on the
operations or financial reporting of the Trust.  For the
years ended November 30 2018 and 2017, there were no
services provided to an affiliate that required the
Trust's audit committee pre-approval.


(f) If greater than 50 percent, disclose the percentage of hours expended on the
principal accountants engagement to audit the registrant's financial statements
for the most recent fiscal year that were attributed to work performed by
persons other than the principal accountant's full-time, permanent employees.

N/A

(g) Disclose the aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrants accountant
for services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to the registrants
investment adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily
portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment
adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant for each of
the last two fiscal years of the registrant.

The aggregate non-audit fees for the Trust were $10,115
payable to Ernst & Young LLP for the year ended
November 30, 2018 and $10,115 for the year
ended November 30, 2017.


(h) Disclose whether the registrants audit committee of the board of trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to
the registrants investment adviser (not including any subadviser whose role is
primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another
investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the
registrant that were not pre-approved pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of
Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with maintaining the principal
accountant's independence.

The Fund's audit committee of the Board of Trustees
has considered whether the provision of non-audit
services that were rendered to the Affiliates (as
defined) that were not pre- approved pursuant to
paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is
compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's
independence.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

(a) If the registrant is a listed issuer as defined in Rule 10A-3
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3), state whether
or not the registrant has a separately-designated standing
 audit committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)).
If the registrant has such a committee, however designated,
identify each committee member. If the entire board of directors
is acting as the registrant's audit committee as specified in
Section 3(a)(58)(B) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(B)),
so state.

N/A

(b) If applicable, provide the disclosure required by Rule 10A-3(d)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10A-3(d)) regarding an exemption
from the listing standards for audit committees.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR
CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

A closed-end management investment company that is filing an annual report on
this Form N-CSR must, unless it invests exclusively in non-voting securities,
describe the policies and procedures that it uses to determine how to vote
proxies relating to portfolio securities, including the procedures that the
company uses when a vote presents a conflict between the interests of its
shareholders, on the one hand, and those of the company's investment adviser;
principal underwriter; or any affiliated person (as defined in Section 2(a)(3)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(3)) and the rules
thereunder) of the company, its investment adviser, or its principal
underwriter, on the other. Include any policies and procedures of the company's
investment adviser, or any other third party, that the company uses, or that are
used on the company's behalf, to determine how to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities.


	            Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of
                       Pioneer Investment Management, Inc.

                            VERSION DATED July, 2004

                                    Overview

   Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer") is a fiduciary that owes
   each of its client's duties of care and loyalty with respect to all
   services undertaken on the client's behalf, including proxy voting. When
   Pioneer has been delegated proxy-voting authority for a client, the duty of
   care requires Pioneer to monitor corporate events and to vote the proxies.
   To satisfy its duty of loyalty, Pioneer must place its client's interests
   ahead of its own and must cast proxy votes in a manner consistent with the
   best interest of its clients. Pioneer will vote all proxies presented in a
   timely manner.

   The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures are designed to complement
   Pioneer's investment policies and procedures regarding its general
   responsibility to monitor the performance and/or corporate events of
   companies that are issuers of securities held in accounts managed by
   Pioneer. Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies summarize Pioneer's position on a
   number of issues solicited by companies held by Pioneer's clients. The
   policies are guidelines that provide a general indication on how Pioneer
   would vote but do not include all potential voting scenarios.

   Pioneer's Proxy Voting Procedures detail monitoring of voting, exception
   votes, and review of conflicts of interest and ensure that case-by-case
   votes are handled within the context of the overall guidelines (i.e. best
   interest of client). The overriding goal is that all proxies for US and
   non-US companies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance
   with Pioneer's policies or specific client instructions. All shares in a
   company held by Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a
   client has given us specific voting instructions on an issue or has not
   delegated authority to us or the Proxy Voting Oversight Group determines
   that the circumstances justify a different approach.

   Pioneer does not delegate the authority to vote proxies relating to its
   clients to any of its affiliates, which include other subsidiaries of
   UniCredito.

   Any questions about these policies and procedures should be directed to the
   Proxy Coordinator.

                             Proxy Voting Procedures

   Proxy Voting Service
   Pioneer has engaged an independent proxy voting service to assist in the
   voting of proxies. The proxy voting service works with custodians to ensure
   that all proxy materials are received by the custodians and are processed
   in a timely fashion. To the extent applicable, the proxy voting service
   votes all proxies in accordance with the proxy voting policies established
   by Pioneer. The proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to the
   Proxy Coordinator (described below) for instructions under circumstances
   where: (1) the application of the proxy voting guidelines is unclear; (2) a
   particular proxy question is not covered by the guidelines; or (3) the
   guidelines call for specific instructions on a case-by-case basis. The
   proxy voting service is also requested to call to the Proxy Coordinator's
   attention specific proxy questions that, while governed by a guideline,
   appear to involve unusual or controversial issues. Pioneer reserves the
   right to attend a meeting in person and may do so when it determines that
   the company or the matters to be voted on at the meeting are strategically
   important to its clients.

   Proxy Coordinator
   Pioneer's Director of Investment Operations (the "Proxy Coordinator")
   coordinates the voting, procedures and reporting of proxies on behalf of
   Pioneer's clients. The Proxy Coordinator will deal directly with the proxy
   voting service and, in the case of proxy questions referred by the proxy
   voting service, will solicit voting recommendations and instructions from
   the Director of Portfolio Management US or, to the extent applicable,
   investment sub-advisers. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for ensuring
   that these questions and referrals are responded to in a timely fashion and
   for transmitting appropriate voting instructions to the proxy voting
   service. The Proxy Coordinator is responsible for verifying with the
   Compliance Department whether Pioneer's voting power is subject to any
   limitations or guidelines issued by the client (or in the case of an
   employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries).

   Referral Items
   From time to time, the proxy voting service will refer proxy questions to
   the Proxy Coordinator that are described by Pioneer's policy as to be voted
   on a case-by-case basis, that are not covered by Pioneer's guidelines or
   where Pioneer's guidelines may be unclear with respect to the matter to be
   voted on. Under such certain circumstances, the Proxy Coordinator will seek
   a written voting recommendation from the Director of Portfolio Management
   US. Any such recommendation will include: (i) the manner in which the
   proxies should be voted; (ii) the rationale underlying any such decision;
   and (iii) the disclosure of any contacts or communications made between
   Pioneer and any outside parties concerning the proxy proposal prior to the
   time that the voting instructions are provided. In addition, the Proxy
   Coordinator will ask the Compliance Department to review the question for
   any actual or apparent conflicts of interest as described below under
   "Conflicts of

                                       2
<PAGE>

   Interest." The Compliance Department will provide a "Conflicts of Interest
   Report," applying the criteria set forth below under "Conflicts of
   Interest," to the Proxy Coordinator summarizing the results of its review.
   In the absence of a conflict of interest, the Proxy Coordinator will vote
   in accordance with the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US.

   If the matter presents a conflict of interest for Pioneer, then the Proxy
   Coordinator will refer the matter to the Proxy Voting Oversight Group for a
   decision. In general, when a conflict of interest is present, Pioneer will
   vote according to the recommendation of the Director of Portfolio
   Management US where such recommendation would go against Pioneer's interest
   or where the conflict is deemed to be immaterial. Pioneer will vote
   according to the recommendation of its proxy voting service when the
   conflict is deemed to be material and the Pioneer's internal vote
   recommendation would favor Pioneer's interest, unless a client specifically
   requests Pioneer to do otherwise. When making the final determination as to
   how to vote a proxy, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will review the
   report from the Director of Portfolio Management US and the Conflicts of
   Interest Report issued by the Compliance Department.

   Conflicts of Interest
   A conflict of interest occurs when Pioneer's interests interfere, or appear
   to interfere with the interests of Pioneer's clients. Occasionally, Pioneer
   may have a conflict that can affect how its votes proxies. The conflict may
   be actual or perceived and may exist when the matter to be voted on
   concerns:

       o      An affiliate of Pioneer,  such as another company  belonging to
              the UniCredito  Italiano  S.p.A.  banking group (a "UniCredito
              Affiliate");

       o      An issuer of a security for which Pioneer acts as a sponsor,
              advisor, manager, custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or
              other similar capacity (including those securities specifically
              declared by PGAM to present a conflict of interest for Pioneer);

       o      An issuer of a security for which UniCredito has informed Pioneer
              that a UniCredito Affiliate acts as a sponsor, advisor, manager,
              custodian, distributor, underwriter, broker, or other similar
              capacity; or

       o      A person with whom Pioneer (or any of its affiliates) has an
              existing, material contract or business relationship that was not
              entered into in the ordinary course of Pioneer's business.

       o      Pioneer will abstain from voting with respect to companies
              directly or indirectly owned by UniCredito Italiano Group, unless
              otherwise directed by a client. In addition, Pioneer will inform
              PGAM Global Compliance and the PGAM Independent Directors before
              exercising such rights.

   Any associate involved in the proxy voting process with knowledge of any
   apparent or actual conflict of interest must disclose such conflict to the
   Proxy Coordinator and the Compliance Department. The Compliance Department
   will review each item referred to Pioneer to determine whether an actual or
   potential conflict of interest with Pioneer exists in connection with the
   proposal(s) to be voted upon. The review will be conducted by comparing the
   apparent parties affected by the proxy proposal being

                                       3
<PAGE>

   voted upon against the Compliance Department's internal list of interested
   persons and, for any matches found, evaluating the anticipated magnitude
   and possible probability of any conflict of interest being present. For
   each referral item, the determination regarding the presence or absence of
   any actual or potential conflict of interest will be documented in a
   Conflicts of Interest Report to the Proxy Coordinator.

   Securities Lending
   In conjunction with industry standards Proxies are not available to be
   voted when the shares are out on loan through either Pioneer's lending
   program or a client's managed security lending program. However, Pioneer
   will reserve the right to recall lent securities so that they may be voted
   according to the Pioneer's instructions. If a portfolio manager would like
   to vote a block of previously lent shares, the Proxy Coordinator will work
   with the portfolio manager and Investment Operations to recall the
   security, to the extent possible, to facilitate the vote on the entire
   block of shares.

   Share-Blocking

   "Share-blocking" is a market practice whereby shares are sent to a
   custodian (which may be different than the account custodian) for record
   keeping and voting at the general meeting. The shares are unavailable for
   sale or delivery until the end of the blocking period (typically the day
   after general meeting date).

   Pioneer will vote in those countries with "share-blocking." In the event a
   manager would like to sell a security with "share-blocking", the Proxy
   Coordinator will work with the Portfolio Manager and Investment Operations
   Department to recall the shares (as allowable within the market time-frame
   and practices) and/or communicate with executing brokerage firm. A list of
   countries with "share-blocking" is available from the Investment Operations
   Department upon request.

   Record Keeping
   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that Pioneer's proxy voting service:

       o   Retains a copy of the proxy statement received (unless the proxy
           statement is available from the SEC's Electronic Data Gathering,
           Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system);

       o   Retains a record of the vote cast;

       o   Prepares Form N-PX for filing on behalf of each client that is a
           registered investment company; and

       o   Is able to promptly provide Pioneer with a copy of the voting
           record upon its request.

                                       4
<PAGE>

   The Proxy Coordinator shall ensure that for those votes that may require
   additional documentation (i.e. conflicts of interest, exception votes and
   case-by-case votes) the following records are maintained:

       o    A record memorializing the basis for each referral vote cast;

       o    A copy of any document created by Pioneer that was material in
            making the decision on how to vote the subject proxy; and

       o    A copy of any conflict notice, conflict consent or any other
            written communication (including emails or other electronic
            communications) to or from the client (or in the case of an
            employee benefit plan, the plan's trustee or other fiduciaries)
            regarding the subject proxy vote cast by, or the vote
            recommendation of, Pioneer.

       o    Pioneer shall maintain the above records in the client's file for a
            period not less than ten (10) years.

     Disclosure
     Pioneer shall take reasonable measures to inform its clients of the process
     or procedures clients must follow to obtain information regarding how
     Pioneer voted with respect to assets held in their accounts. In addition,
     Pioneer shall describe to clients its proxy voting policies and procedures
     and will furnish a copy of its proxy voting policies and procedures upon
     request. This information may be provided to clients through Pioneer's Form
     ADV (Part II) disclosure, by separate notice to the client, or through
     Pioneer's website.

     Proxy Voting Oversight Group
     The members of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group are Pioneer's: Director of
     Portfolio Management US, Head of Investment Operations, and Director of
     Compliance. Other members of Pioneer will be invited to attend meetings and
     otherwise participate as necessary. The Head of Investment Operations will
     chair the Proxy Voting Oversight Group.

     The Proxy Voting Oversight Group is responsible for developing, evaluating,
     and changing (when necessary) Pioneer's Proxy Voting Policies and
     Procedures. The group meets at least annually to evaluate and review these
     policies and procedures and the services of its third-party proxy voting
     service. In addition, the Proxy Voting Oversight Group will meet as
     necessary to vote on referral items and address other business as
     necessary.

     Amendments
     Pioneer may not amend its Proxy Voting Policies And Procedures without the
     prior approval of the Proxy Voting Oversight Group and its corporate
     parent, Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A

                                       5

   Proxy Voting Policies
   Pioneer's sole concern in voting proxies is the economic effect of the
   proposal on the value of portfolio holdings, considering both the short-
   and long-term impact. In many instances, Pioneer believes that supporting
   the company's strategy and voting "for" management's proposals builds
   portfolio value. In other cases, however, proposals set forth by management
   may have a negative effect on that value, while some shareholder proposals
   may hold the best prospects for enhancing it. Pioneer monitors developments
   in the proxy-voting arena and will revise this policy as needed.

   All proxies that are received promptly will be voted in accordance with the
   specific policies listed below. All shares in a company held by
   Pioneer-managed accounts will be voted alike, unless a client has given us
   specific voting instructions on an issue or has not delegated authority to
   us. Proxy voting issues will be reviewed by Pioneer's Proxy Voting
   Oversight Group, which consists of the Director of Portfolio Management US,
   the Director of Investment Operations (the Proxy Coordinator), and the
   Director of Compliance.

   Pioneer has established Proxy Voting Procedures for identifying and
   reviewing conflicts of interest that may arise in the voting of proxies.

   Clients may request, at any time, a report on proxy votes for securities
   held in their portfolios and Pioneer is happy to discuss our proxy votes
   with company management. Pioneer retains a proxy voting service to provide
   research on proxy issues and to process proxy votes.

Administrative
   While administrative items appear infrequently in U.S. issuer proxies, they
   are quite common in non-U.S. proxies.

   We will generally support these and similar management proposals:

       o    Corporate name change.

       o    A change of corporate headquarters.

       o    Stock exchange listing.

       o    Establishment of time and place of annual meeting.

       o    Adjournment or postponement of annual meeting.

       o    Acceptance/approval of financial statements.

       o    Approval of dividend payments, dividend reinvestment plans and other
            dividend-related proposals.

       o    Approval of minutes and other formalities.

                                       6
<PAGE>

       o    Authorization of the transferring of reserves and allocation of
            income.

       o    Amendments to authorized signatories.

       o    Approval of accounting method changes or change in fiscal year-end.

       o    Acceptance of labor agreements.

       o    Appointment of internal auditors.

   Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case basis on other routine business;
   however, Pioneer will oppose any routine business proposal if insufficient
   information is presented in advance to allow Pioneer to judge the merit of
   the proposal. Pioneer has also instructed its proxy voting service to
   inform Pioneer of its analysis of any administrative items inconsistent, in
   its view, with supporting the value of Pioneer portfolio holdings so that
   Pioneer may consider and vote on those items on a case-by-case basis.

Auditors
     We normally vote for proposals to:

       o    Ratify the auditors. We will consider a vote against if we are
            concerned about the auditors' independence or their past work for
            the company. Specifically, we will oppose the ratification of
            auditors and withhold votes from audit committee members if
            non-audit fees paid by the company to the auditing firm exceed the
            sum of audit fees plus audit-related fees plus permissible tax
            fees according to the disclosure categories proposed by the
            Securities and Exchange Commission.

       o    Restore shareholder rights to ratify the auditors.

     We will normally oppose proposals that require companies to:

       o    Seek bids from other auditors.

       o    Rotate auditing firms, except where the rotation is statutorily
            required or where rotation would demonstrably strengthen financial
            disclosure.

       o    Indemnify auditors.

       o    Prohibit auditors from engaging in non-audit services for the
            company.

     Board of Directors
     On issues related to the board of directors, Pioneer normally supports
     management. We will, however, consider a vote against management in
     instances where corporate performance has been very poor or where the board
     appears to lack independence.

                                       7
<PAGE>

     General Board Issues
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Audit, compensation and nominating committees composed of
            independent directors exclusively.

       o    Indemnification for directors for actions taken in good faith in
            accordance with the business judgment rule. We will vote against
            proposals for broader indemnification.

       o    Changes in board size that appear to have a legitimate business
            purpose and are not primarily for anti-takeover reasons.

       o    Election of an honorary director.

     We will vote against:

       o    Minimum stock ownership by directors.

       o    Term limits for directors. Companies benefit from experienced
            directors, and shareholder control is better achieved through
            annual votes.

       o    Requirements for union or special interest representation on the
            board.

       o    Requirements to provide two candidates for each board seat.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Separate chairman and CEO positions. We will consider voting with
            shareholders on these issues in cases of poor corporate
            performance.

     Elections of Directors
     In uncontested elections of directors we will vote against:

       o    Individual directors with absenteeism above 25% without valid
            reason. We support proposals that require disclosure of director
            attendance.

       o    Insider directors and affiliated outsiders who sit on the audit,
            compensation, stock option or nominating committees. For the
            purposes of our policy, we accept the definition of affiliated
            directors provided by our proxy voting service.

     We will also vote against:

       o    Directors who have failed to act on a takeover offer where the
            majority of shareholders have tendered their shares.

       o    Directors who appear to lack independence or are associated with
            very poor corporate performance.

                                       8
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Re-election of directors who have implemented or renewed a
            dead-hand or modified dead-hand poison pill (a "dead-hand poison
            pill" is a shareholder rights plan that may be altered only by
            incumbent or "dead " directors. These plans prevent a potential
            acquirer from disabling a poison pill by obtaining control of the
            board through a proxy vote).

       o    Contested election of directors.

       o    Prior to phase-in required by SEC, we would consider supporting
            election of a majority of independent directors in cases of poor
            performance.

       o    Mandatory retirement policies.

       o    Directors who have ignored a shareholder proposal that has been
            approved by shareholders for two consecutive years.

     Takeover-Related Measures
     Pioneer is generally opposed to proposals that may discourage takeover
     attempts. We believe that the potential for a takeover helps ensure that
     corporate performance remains high.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Cumulative voting.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to call special meetings.

       o    Increase ability for shareholders to act by written consent.

       o    Restrictions on the ability to make greenmail payments.

       o    Submitting rights plans to shareholder vote.

       o    Rescinding shareholder rights plans ("poison pills").

       o    Opting out of the following state takeover statutes:

     o Control share acquisition statutes, which deny large holders voting
       rights on holdings over a specified threshold.

     o Control share cash-out provisions, which require large holders to
       acquire shares from other holders.

     o Freeze-out provisions, which impose a waiting period on large
       holders before they can attempt to gain control.

     o Stakeholder laws, which permit directors to consider interests of
       non-shareholder constituencies.

                                       9
<PAGE>

     o Disgorgement provisions, which require acquirers to disgorge profits
       on purchases made before gaining control.

     o Fair price provisions.

     o Authorization of shareholder rights plans.

     o Labor protection provisions.

     o Mandatory classified boards.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Fair price provisions. We will vote against provisions requiring
            supermajority votes to approve takeovers. We will also consider
            voting against proposals that require a supermajority vote to
            repeal or amend the provision. Finally, we will consider the
            mechanism used to determine the fair price; we are generally
            opposed to complicated formulas or requirements to pay a premium.

       o    Opting out of state takeover statutes regarding fair price
            provisions. We will use the criteria used for fair price
            provisions in general to determine our vote on this issue.

       o    Proposals that allow shareholders to nominate directors.

     We will vote against:

       o    Classified boards, except in the case of closed-end mutual funds.

       o    Limiting shareholder ability to remove or appoint directors. We
            will support proposals to restore shareholder authority in this
            area. We will review on a case-by-case basis proposals that
            authorize the board to make interim appointments.

       o    Classes of shares with unequal voting rights.

       o    Supermajority vote requirements.

       o    Severance packages ("golden" and "tin" parachutes). We will support
            proposals to put these packages to shareholder vote.

       o    Reimbursement of dissident proxy solicitation expenses. While we
            ordinarily support measures that encourage takeover bids, we
            believe that management should have full control over corporate
            funds.

       o    Extension of advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals.

       o    Granting board authority normally retained by shareholders (e.g.,
            amend charter, set board size).

       o    Shareholder rights plans ("poison pills"). These plans generally
            allow shareholders to buy additional shares at a below-market
            price in the event of a change in control and may deter some bids.

                                       10

     Capital Structure
     Managements need considerable flexibility in determining the company's
     financial structure, and Pioneer normally supports managements' proposals
     in this area. We will, however, reject proposals that impose high barriers
     to potential takeovers.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Changes in par value.

       o    Reverse splits, if accompanied by a reduction in number of shares.

       o    Share repurchase programs, if all shareholders may participate on
            equal terms.

       o    Bond issuance.

       o    Increases in "ordinary" preferred stock.

       o    Proposals to have blank-check common stock placements (other than
            shares issued in the normal course of business) submitted for
            shareholder approval.

       o    Cancellation of company treasury shares.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Reverse splits not accompanied by a reduction in number of shares,
            considering the risk of delisting.

       o    Increase in authorized common stock. We will make a determination
            considering, among other factors:

     o Number of shares currently available for issuance;

     o Size of requested increase (we would normally approve increases of up to
       100% of current authorization);

     o Proposed use of the additional shares; and

     o Potential consequences of a failure to increase the number of shares
       outstanding (e.g., delisting or bankruptcy).

       o    Blank-check preferred. We will normally oppose issuance of a new
            class of blank-check preferred, but may approve an increase in a
            class already outstanding if the company has demonstrated that it
            uses this flexibility appropriately.

       o    Proposals to submit private placements to shareholder vote.

       o    Other financing plans.

     We will vote against preemptive rights that we believe limit a company's
financing flexibility.

                                      11

     Compensation
     Pioneer supports compensation plans that link pay to shareholder returns
     and believes that management has the best understanding of the level of
     compensation needed to attract and retain qualified people. At the same
     time, stock-related compensation plans have a significant economic impact
     and a direct effect on the balance sheet. Therefore, while we do not want
     to micromanage a company's compensation programs, we will place limits on
     the potential dilution these plans may impose.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    401(k) benefit plans.

       o    Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), as long as shares
            allocated to ESOPs are less than 5% of outstanding shares. Larger
            blocks of stock in ESOPs can serve as a takeover defense. We will
            support proposals to submit ESOPs to shareholder vote.

       o    Various issues related to the Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act
            of 1993 (OBRA), including:

     o Amendments to performance plans to conform with OBRA;

     o Caps on annual grants or amendments of administrative features;

     o Adding performance goals; and

     o Cash or cash-and-stock bonus plans.

       o    Establish a process to link pay, including stock-option grants, to
            performance, leaving specifics of implementation to the company.

       o    Require that option repricings be submitted to shareholders.

       o    Require the expensing of stock-option awards.

       o    Require reporting of executive retirement benefits (deferred
            compensation, split-dollar life insurance, SERPs, and pension
            benefits).

       o    Employee stock purchase plans where the purchase price is equal to
            at least 85% of the market price, where the offering period is no
            greater than 27 months and where potential dilution (as defined
            below) is no greater than 10%.

                                       12
<PAGE>

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Executive and director stock-related compensation plans. We will
            consider the following factors when reviewing these plans:

       o    The program must be of a reasonable size. We will approve plans
            where the combined employee and director plans together would
            generate less than 15% dilution. We will reject plans with 15% or
            more potential dilution.

            Dilution = (A + B + C) / (A + B + C + D), where

            A = Shares reserved for plan/amendment,

            B = Shares available under continuing plans,

            C = Shares granted but unexercised and

            D = Shares outstanding.

       o    The plan must not:

            o   Explicitly permit unlimited option repricing authority or that
                have repriced in the past without shareholder approval.

            o   Be a self-replenishing "evergreen" plan, plans that grant
                discount options and tax offset payments.

     o We are generally in favor of proposals that increase participation beyond
       executives.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt rigorous
       vesting provisions for stock option plans such as those that vest
       incrementally over, at least, a three- or four-year period with a pro
       rata portion of the shares becoming exercisable on an annual basis
       following grant date.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to disclose their
       window period policies for stock transactions. Window period policies
       ensure that employees do not exercise options based on insider
       information contemporaneous with quarterly earnings releases and other
       material corporate announcements.

     o We generally support proposals asking companies to adopt stock holding
       periods for their executives.

       o    All other employee stock purchase plans.

       o    All other compensation-related proposals, including deferred
            compensation plans, employment agreements, loan guarantee programs
            and retirement plans.

       o    All other proposals regarding stock compensation plans, including
            extending the life of a plan, changing vesting restrictions,
            repricing options, lengthening exercise periods or accelerating
            distribution of awards and pyramiding and cashless exercise
            programs.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     We will vote against:

       o    Pensions for non-employee directors. We believe these retirement
            plans reduce director objectivity.

       o    Elimination of stock option plans.

     We will vote on a case-by case basis on these issues:

       o    Limits on executive and director pay.

       o    Stock in lieu of cash compensation for directors.

     Corporate Governance
     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Confidential Voting.

       o    Equal access provisions, which allow shareholders to contribute
            their opinion to proxy materials.

       o    Proposals requiring directors to disclose their ownership of shares
            in the company.

     We will vote on a case-by-case basis on the following issues:

       o    Change in the state of incorporation. We will support
            reincorporations supported by valid business reasons. We will
            oppose those that appear to be solely for the purpose of
            strengthening takeover defenses.

       o    Bundled proposals. We will evaluate the overall impact of the
            proposal.

       o    Adopting or amending the charter, bylaws or articles of association.

       o    Shareholder appraisal rights, which allow shareholders to demand
            judicial review of an acquisition price.

     We will vote against:

       o    Shareholder advisory committees. While management should solicit
            shareholder input, we prefer to leave the method of doing so to
            management's discretion.

       o    Limitations on stock ownership or voting rights.

       o    Reduction in share ownership disclosure guidelines.

     Mergers and Restructurings
     Pioneer will vote on the following and similar issues on a case-by-case
     basis:

       o    Mergers and acquisitions.

       o    Corporate restructurings, including spin-offs, liquidations, asset
            sales, joint ventures, conversions to holding company and
            conversions to self-managed REIT structure.

       o    Debt restructurings.

       o    Conversion of securities.

       o    Issuance of shares to facilitate a merger.

       o    Private placements, warrants, convertible debentures.

       o    Proposals requiring management to inform shareholders of merger
            opportunities.

     We will normally vote against shareholder proposals requiring that the
     company be put up for sale.

     Mutual Funds
     Many of our portfolios may invest in shares of closed-end mutual funds or
     exchange-traded funds. The non-corporate structure of these investments
     raises several unique proxy voting issues.

     Pioneer will vote for:

       o    Establishment of new classes or series of shares.

       o    Establishment of a master-feeder structure.

     Pioneer will vote on a case-by-case on:

       o    Changes in investment policy. We will normally support changes
            that do not affect the investment objective or overall risk level
            of the fund. We will examine more fundamental changes on a
            case-by-case basis.

       o    Approval of new or amended advisory contracts.

       o    Changes from closed-end to open-end format.

       o    Authorization for, or increase in, preferred shares.

       o    Disposition of assets, termination, liquidation, or mergers.

       o    Classified boards of closed-end mutual funds, but will typically
            support such proposals.

                                       15
<PAGE>

     Social Issues
     Pioneer will abstain on stockholder proposals calling for greater
     disclosure of corporate activities with regard to social issues. "Social
     Issues" may generally be described as shareholder proposals for a company
     to:

       o    Conduct studies regarding certain issues of public concern and
            interest;

       o    Study the feasibility of the company taking certain actions with
            regard to such issues; or

       o    Take specific action, including ceasing certain behavior and
            adopting company standards and principles, in relation to issues
            of public concern and interest.

     We believe these issues are important and should receive management
     attention.

     Pioneer will vote against proposals calling for substantial changes in the
     company's business or activities. We will also normally vote against
     proposals with regard to contributions, believing that management should
     control the routine disbursement of funds.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
When a portfolio manager is responsible for the management of more than one
account, the potential arises for the portfolio manager to favor one account
over another. The principal types of potential conflicts of interest that may
arise are discussed below. For the reasons outlined below, Amundi Pioneer does
not believe that any material conflicts are likely to arise out of a portfolio
manager's responsibility for the management of the fund as well as one or more
other accounts. Although Amundi Pioneer has adopted procedures that it believes
are reasonably designed to detect and prevent violations of the federal
securities laws and to mitigate the potential for conflicts of interest to
affect its portfolio management decisions, there can be no assurance that all
conflicts will be identified or that all procedures will be effective in
mitigating the potential for such risks. Generally, the risks of such conflicts
of interest are increased to the extent that a portfolio manager has a
financial incentive to favor one account over another. Amundi Pioneer has
structured its compensation arrangements in a manner that is intended to limit
such potential for conflicts of interest. See "Compensation of Portfolio
Managers" below.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in allocating new
  investment opportunities that have limited supply, such as initial public
  offerings and private placements. If, for example, an initial public
  offering that was expected to appreciate in value significantly shortly
  after the offering was allocated to a single account, that account may be
  expected to have better investment performance than other accounts that did
  not receive an allocation of the initial public offering. Generally,
  investments for which there is limited availability are allocated based upon
  a range of factors including available cash and consistency with the
  accounts' investment objectives and policies. This allocation methodology
  necessarily involves some subjective elements but is intended over time to
  treat each client in an equitable and fair manner. Generally, the investment
  opportunity is allocated among participating accounts on a pro rata


                                       0
<PAGE>

 basis. Although Amundi Pioneer believes that its practices are reasonably
 designed to treat each client in an equitable and fair manner, there may be
 instances where a fund may not participate, or may participate to a lesser
 degree than other clients, in the allocation of an investment opportunity.

o A portfolio manager could favor one account over another in the order in
  which trades for the accounts are placed. If a portfolio manager determines
  to purchase a security for more than one account in an aggregate amount that
  may influence the market price of the security, accounts that purchased or
  sold the security first may receive a more favorable price than accounts
  that made subsequent transactions. The less liquid the market for the
  security or the greater the percentage that the proposed aggregate purchases
  or sales represent of average daily trading volume, the greater the
  potential for accounts that make subsequent purchases or sales to receive a
  less favorable price. When a portfolio manager intends to trade the same
  security on the same day for more than one account, the trades typically are
  "bunched," which means that the trades for the individual accounts are
  aggregated and each account receives the same price. There are some types of
  accounts as to which bunching may not be possible for contractual reasons
  (such as directed brokerage arrangements). Circumstances may also arise
  where the trader believes that bunching the orders may not result in the
  best possible price. Where those accounts or circumstances are involved,
  Amundi Pioneer will place the order in a manner intended to result in as
  favorable a price as possible for such client.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager's
  compensation is tied to the performance of that account to a greater degree
  than other accounts managed by the portfolio manager. If, for example, the
  portfolio manager receives a bonus based upon the performance of certain
  accounts relative to a benchmark while other accounts are disregarded for
  this purpose, the portfolio manager will have a financial incentive to seek
  to have the accounts that determine the portfolio manager's bonus achieve
  the best possible performance to the possible detriment of other accounts.
  Similarly, if Amundi Pioneer receives a performance-based advisory fee, the
  portfolio manager may favor that account, whether or not the performance of
  that account directly determines the portfolio manager's compensation.

o A portfolio manager could favor an account if the portfolio manager has a
  beneficial interest in the account, in order to benefit a large client or to
  compensate a client that had poor returns. For example, if the portfolio
  manager held an interest in an investment partnership that was one of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager, the portfolio manager would have
  an economic incentive to favor the account in which the portfolio manager
  held an interest.

o If the different accounts have materially and potentially conflicting
  investment objectives or strategies, a conflict of interest could arise. For
  example, if a portfolio manager purchases a security for one account and
  sells the same security for another account, such trading pattern may
  disadvantage either the account that is long or short. In making portfolio
  manager assignments, Amundi Pioneer seeks to avoid such potentially
  conflicting situations. However, where a portfolio manager is responsible
  for accounts with differing investment objectives and policies, it is
  possible that the portfolio manager will conclude that it is in the best
  interest of one account to sell a portfolio security while another account
  continues to hold or increase the holding in such security.


COMPENSATION OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER
Amundi Pioneer has adopted a system of compensation for portfolio managers that
seeks to align the financial interests of the portfolio managers with those of
shareholders of the accounts (including Pioneer funds) the portfolio managers
manage, as well as with the financial performance of Amundi Pioneer. The
compensation program for all Amundi Pioneer portfolio managers includes a base
salary (determined by the rank and tenure of the employee) and an annual bonus
program, as well as customary benefits that are offered generally to all
full-time employees. Base compensation is fixed and normally reevaluated on an
annual basis. Amundi Pioneer seeks to set base compensation at market rates,
taking into account the experience and responsibilities of the portfolio
manager. The bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of annual
bonus compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving superior
investment performance and align the interests of the investment professional
with those of shareholders, as well as


                                       1
<PAGE>

with the financial performance of Amundi Pioneer. Any bonus under the plan is
completely discretionary, with a maximum annual bonus that may be in excess of
base salary. The annual bonus is based upon a combination of the following
factors:

o QUANTITATIVE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The quantitative investment performance
  calculation is based on pre-tax investment performance of all of the
  accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes the fund and any
  other accounts managed by the portfolio manager) over a one-year period (20%
  weighting) and four-year period (80% weighting), measured for periods ending
  on December 31. The accounts, which include the fund, are ranked against a
  group of mutual funds with similar investment objectives and investment
  focus (60%) and a broad-based securities market index measuring the
  performance of the same type of securities in which the accounts invest
  (40%), which, in the case of the fund, is the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
  High Yield Master II Index. As a result of these two benchmarks, the
  performance of the portfolio manager for compensation purposes is measured
  against the criteria that are relevant to the portfolio manager's
  competitive universe.

o QUALITATIVE PERFORMANCE. The qualitative performance component with respect
  to all of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager includes objectives,
  such as effectiveness in the areas of teamwork, leadership, communications
  and marketing, that are mutually established and evaluated by each portfolio
  manager and management.

o AMUNDI PIONEER RESULTS AND BUSINESS LINE RESULTS. Amundi Pioneer's financial
  performance, as well as the investment performance of its investment
  management group, affect a portfolio manager's actual bonus by a leverage
  factor of plus or minus (+/-) a predetermined percentage.

The quantitative and qualitative performance components comprise 80% and 20%,
respectively, of the overall bonus calculation (on a pre-adjustment basis). A
portion of the annual bonus is deferred for a specified period and may be
invested in one or more Pioneer funds.

Certain portfolio managers participate in other programs designed to reward and
retain key contributors. Portfolio managers also may participate in a deferred
compensation program, whereby deferred amounts are invested in one or more
Pioneer funds.

ITEM 9. PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT
INVESTMENT COMPANY AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company,
in the following tabular format, provide the information specified in
paragraph (b) of this Item with respect to any purchase made by or on
behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser, as defined in
Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-18(a)(3)), of
shares or other units of any class of the registrant's equity securities
that is registered by the registrant pursuant to Section 12 of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 781).

During the period covered by this report, there were no purchases
made by or on behalf of the registrant or any affiliated purchaser
as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (the Exchange Act), of shares of the registrants equity
securities that are registered by the registrant pursuant to
Section 12 of the Exchange Act.



ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

Describe any material changes to the procedures by which shareholders
may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of directors, where
those changes were implemented after the registrant last provided
disclosure in response to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of
Regulation S-R(17 CFR 229.407)(as required by Item 22(b)(15))
of Schedule 14A (17 CFR 240.14a-101), or this Item.


There have been no material changes to the procedures by which the
shareholders may recommend nominees to the registrant's board of
directors since the registrant last provided disclosure in response
to the requirements of Item 407(c)(2)(iv) of Regulation S-R of Schedule 14(A)
in its definitive proxy statement, or this item.


ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Disclose the conclusions of the registrant's principal executive and
principal financials officers, or persons performing similar functions,
regarding the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Act (17 CFR
270.30a-3(c))) as of a date within 90 days of the filing date of the report
that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph,
based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by Rule
30a-3(b) under the Act (17 CFR 270.30(a)-3(b) and Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b)
under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13a-15(b) or 240.15d-15(b)).

The registrant's principal executive officer
and principal financial officer have
concluded that the registrant's disclosure
controls and procedures are effective based
on the evaluation of these controls and
procedures as of a date within 90 days of the
filing date of this report.


(b) Disclose any change in the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act (17CFR 270.30a-3(d)) that
occured during the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report
that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

There were no significant changes in the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the second
fiscal quarter of the period covered by this
report that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the
registrant's internal control over financial
reporting.

The registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, however, voluntarily are reporting the following information:

In August of 2006 the registrant's investment adviser
enhanced its internal procedures for reporting performance
information required to be included in prospectuses.
Those enhancements involved additional internal controls
over the appropriateness of performance data
generated for this purpose.  Such enhancements were made
following an internal review which identified
prospectuses relating to certain classes of shares of
a limited number of registrants where, inadvertently,
performance information not reflecting the deduction of
applicable sales charges was included. Those prospectuses
were revised, and the revised prospectuses were distributed to
shareholders.

Item 12. Disclosure of Securities Lending Activities for Closed-End
Management Investment Companies.

(a) If the registrant is a closed-end management investment company,
provide the following dollar amounts of income and compensation related
to the securities lending activities of the registrant during its most

N/A

(4) Net income from securities lending activities (i.e., the dollar amount in
paragraph (1) minus the dollar amount in paragraph (3)).

If a fee for a service is included in the revenue split, state that the fee
is included in the revenue split.

N/A

                                CODE OF ETHICS

                                      FOR

                                SENIOR OFFICERS

POLICY

   This Code of Ethics for Senior Officers (this "Code") sets forth the
   policies, practices and values expected to be exhibited by Senior Officers
   of the Pioneer Funds (collectively, the "Funds" and each, a "Fund"). This
   Code does not apply generally to officers and employees of service providers
   to the Funds, including Pioneer Investment Management, Inc. ("Pioneer"),
   unless such officers and employees are also Senior Officers.

   The term "Senior Officers" shall mean the principal executive officer,
   principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller of
   the Funds, although one person may occupy more than one such office. Each
   Senior Officer is identified by title in Exhibit A to this Code.

   The Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") of the Pioneer Funds is primarily
   responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance with this Code,
   subject to the overall supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Funds
   (the "Board"). The CCO has the authority to interpret this Code and its
   applicability to particular situations. Any questions about this Code should
   be directed to the CCO or his or her designee.

PURPOSE

   The purposes of this Code are to:

       .  Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of
          actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and
          professional relationships;

       .  Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
          reports and documents that the Fund files with, or submits to, the
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
          communications made by the Fund;

       .  Promote compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and
          regulations;

       .  Promote the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
          appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

       .  Establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

   Each Senior Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
   should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
   apparent conflicts of interest.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF SENIOR OFFICERS

Conflicts of Interest

   A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Senior Officer's private interests
   interfere in any way - or even appear to interfere - with the interests of
   or his/her service to a Fund. A conflict can arise when a Senior Officer
   takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or
   her Fund work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest also arise
   when a Senior Officer or a member of his/her family receives improper
   personal benefits as a result of the Senior Officer's position with the Fund.

   Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Senior
   Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest
   provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "ICA"),
   and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "IAA"). For
   example, Senior Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
   (such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the
   Funds because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the Funds. The
   Fund's and Pioneer's compliance programs and procedures are designed to
   prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code
   does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace such policies and
   procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

   Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
   benefit, conflicts arise as a result of the contractual relationship between
   the Fund and Pioneer because the Senior Officers are officers or employees
   of both. As a result, this Code recognizes that Senior Officers will, in the
   normal course of their duties (whether formally for a Fund or for Pioneer,
   or for both), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
   decisions that will have different effects on Pioneer and the Fund. The
   participation of Senior Officers in such activities is inherent in the
   contractual relationship between a Fund and Pioneer and is consistent with
   the performance by the Senior Officers of their duties as officers of the
   Fund and, if addressed in conformity with the provisions of the ICA and the
   IAA, will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is
   recognized by the Board that Senior Officers may also be officers of
   investment companies other than the Pioneer Funds.

   Other conflicts of interest are covered by this Code, even if such conflicts
   of interest are not subject to provisions of the ICA or the IAA. In reading
   the following examples of conflicts of interest under this Code, Senior
   Officers should keep in mind that such a list cannot ever be exhaustive or
   cover every possible

   scenario. It follows that the overarching principle is that the personal
   interest of a Senior Officer should not be placed improperly before the
   interest of a Fund.

   Each Senior Officer must:

       .  Not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
          improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
          by a Fund whereby the Senior Officer would benefit personally to the
          detriment of the Fund;

       .  Not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
          individual personal benefit of the Senior Officer rather than the
          benefit of the Fund; and

       .  Report at least annually any affiliations or other relationships that
          give rise to conflicts of interest.

   Any material conflict of interest situation should be approved by the CCO,
   his or her designee or the Board. Examples of these include:

       .  Service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

       .  The receipt of any gift with a value in excess of an amount
          established from time to time by Pioneer's Business Gift and
          Entertainment Policy from any single non-relative person or entity.
          Customary business lunches, dinners and entertainment at which both
          the Senior Officer and the giver are present, and promotional items
          of insignificant value are exempt from this prohibition;

       .  The receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
          has current or prospective business dealings unless such
          entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as
          to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
          impropriety;

       .  Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
          relationship with, any of a Fund's service providers other than its
          investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any
          affiliated person thereof; and

       .  A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
          charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
          transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an
          interest arising from the Senior Officer's employment, such as
          compensation or equity ownership.

Corporate Opportunities

   Senior Officers may not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities
   that are discovered through the use of a Fund's property, information or
   position; (b) use a Fund's property, information, or position for personal
   gain; or (c) compete with a Fund. Senior Officers owe a duty to the Funds to
   advance their legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

Confidentiality

   Senior Officers should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted
   to them by the Funds, except when disclosure is authorized or legally
   mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that
   might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Funds, if disclosed.

Fair dealing with Fund shareholders, suppliers, and competitors

   Senior Officers should endeavor to deal fairly with the Funds' shareholders,
   suppliers, and competitors. Senior Officers should not take unfair advantage
   of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged
   information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
   unfair-dealing practice. Senior Officers should not knowingly misrepresent
   or cause others to misrepresent facts about a Fund to others, whether within
   or outside the Fund, including to the Board, the Funds' auditors or to
   governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

Compliance with Law

   Each Senior Officer must not knowingly violate any law, rule and regulation
   applicable to his or her activities as an officer of the Funds. In addition,
   Senior Officers are responsible for understanding and promoting compliance
   with the laws, rules and regulations applicable to his or her particular
   position and by persons under the Senior Officer's supervision. Senior
   Officers should endeavor to comply not only with the letter of the law, but
   also with the spirit of the law.

Disclosure

   Each Senior Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
   disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds. Each Senior
   Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her area of
   responsibility, consult with other officers of the Funds and Pioneer with
   the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable
   disclosure in the reports and documents a Fund files with, or submits to,
   the SEC and in other public communications made by the Funds.

INITIAL AND ANNUAL CERTIFICATIONS

   Upon becoming a Senior Officer the Senior Officer is required to certify
   that he or she has received, read, and understands this Code. On an annual
   basis, each Senior Officer must certify that he or she has complied with all
   of the applicable requirements of this Code.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE CODE

Report of Violations

   Pioneer relies on each Senior Officer to report promptly if he or she knows
   of any conduct by a Senior Officer in violation of this Code. All violations
   or suspected violations of this Code must be reported to the CCO or a member
   of Pioneer's Legal and Compliance Department. Failure to do so is itself a
   violation of this Code.

Investigation of Violations

   Upon notification of a violation or suspected violation, the CCO or other
   members of Pioneer's Compliance Department will take all appropriate action
   to investigate the potential violation reported. If, after such
   investigation, the CCO believes that no violation has occurred, the CCO and
   Compliance Department is not required to take no further action. Any matter
   the CCO believes is a violation will be reported to the Independent
   Trustees. If the Independent Trustees concur that a violation has occurred,
   they will inform and make a recommendation to the full Board. The Board
   shall be responsible for determining appropriate action. The Funds, their
   officers and employees, will not retaliate against any Senior Officer for
   reports of potential violations that are made in good faith and without
   malicious intent.

   The CCO or his or her designee is responsible for applying this Code to
   specific situations in which questions are presented under it and has the
   authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CCO or his
   or her designee shall make inquiries regarding any potential conflict of
   interest.

Violations and Sanctions

   Compliance with this Code is expected and violations of its provisions will
   be taken seriously and could result in disciplinary action. In response to
   violations of the Code, the Board may impose such sanctions as it deems
   appropriate within the scope of its authority over Senior Officers,
   including termination as an officer of the Funds.

Waivers from the Code

   The Independent Trustees will consider any approval or waiver sought by any
   Senior Officer.

   The Independent Trustees will be responsible for granting waivers, as
   appropriate. Any change to or waiver of this Code will, to the extent
   required, be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

   This Code shall be the sole Code of Ethics adopted by the Funds for purposes
   of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable
   to registered investment companies thereunder. The Funds', Pioneer's, and
   Pioneer Funds Distributor, Inc.'s Codes of Ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
   ICA and Rule 204A-1 of the IAA are separate requirements applying to the
   Senior Officers and others, and are not a part of this Code. To the extent
   any other policies and procedures of the Funds, Pioneer or Pioneer

   Fund Distributor, Inc. overlap or conflict with the provisions of the this
   Code, they are superseded by this Code.

SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES

   A Senior Officer's responsibilities under this Code are limited to Fund
   matters over which the Senior Officer has direct responsibility or control,
   matters in which the Senior Officer routinely participates, and matters with
   which the Senior Officer is otherwise involved. In addition, a Senior
   Officer is responsible for matters of which the Senior Officer has actual
   knowledge.

AMENDMENTS

   This Code other than Exhibit A may not be amended except in a writing that
   is specifically approved or ratified by a majority vote of the Board,
   including a majority of the Independent Trustees.

CONFIDENTIALITY

   All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will be
   considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
   Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
   disclosed to anyone other than the Board and their counsel or to Pioneer's
   Legal and Compliance Department.

INTERNAL USE

   This Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does not
   constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
   circumstance, or legal conclusion.
