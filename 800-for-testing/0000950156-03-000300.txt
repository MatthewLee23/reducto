                           OF SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) permits mutual funds to deliver
only one copy of shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy
statements and shareholder reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at
the same residential or post office box address. This practice is often called
"householding" and it helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER, MAY HOUSEHOLD THE MAILING OF YOUR
DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST AS OF JUNE 30, 2003

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Photo of James B. Hawkes]

James B. Hawkes
President

As a tentative economy resulted in dramatically lower interest rates, Eaton
Vance Senior Income Trust again provided an attractive yield in a portfolio of
senior floating-rate loans. Based on the Trust's June monthly dividend of
$0.044 per share and a closing share price of $8.920, the Trust's market yield
was 5.92% at June 30, 2003.(1)

SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES CONTINUED TO DECLINE FURTHER IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS
OF 2003...

The fiscal year ended June 30, 2003 was characterized by modest steps toward
economic recovery and an improvement in credit conditions. First quarter 2003
GDP expanded at a sluggish 1.4%, followed by a 2.4% growth rate in the second
quarter. The Federal Reserve maintained an accommodative monetary posture
throughout the fiscal year and, by June 30, had lowered the Federal Funds rate
to 1.0%. However, while many anecdotal measures reiterated the slowness of the
recovery, an upturn in corporate earnings suggested a distinct turn for the
better.

FLOATING-RATE LOANS PERFORMED WELL IN AN UNCERTAIN PERIOD...

In light of the difficult economic and geopolitical environment, the loan
market performed relatively well during the year. Especially encouraging, loan
prices rose in response to the improved business outlook, a trend reflected in
the Trust. And while the Trust's dividend reflected the downward trend in
interest rates, it nonetheless continued to represent a competitive yield
relative to other income producing vehicles. And the Trust's floating-rate
loans - typically senior and secured - provided a measure of protection in the
course of an uncertain year. In short, the loan market performed well within
expectations.

A STRONGER ECONOMY COULD MEAN NEW INCOME OPPORTUNITIES IN SENIOR FLOATING-RATE
LOANS ...

A rebound in equity prices has contributed to a rise in consumer confidence.
Meanwhile, the falling dollar has given a boost to export-sensitive companies
and corporate profits have edged higher, helped, in part, by cost cuts.
Finally, the tax cuts enacted in the spring are expected to boost consumer
spending as the year progresses. Clearly, the pieces are in place for a
recovery, although the pace of the recovery remains unknown. As conditions
improve, we expect that a stronger economy will provide fresh income
opportunities in senior floating- rate loans. In the pages that follow,
portfolio managers John Redding, Scott Page and Payson Swaffield discuss the
events that impacted the loan market and the Trust during the past year.

    Sincerely,

/s/ James B. Hawkes

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION

John P. Redding

An interview with John P. Redding, Scott H. Page and Payson F. Swaffield,
portfolio managers of Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust.

Q:  John, this has been a very eventful year, marked by the war in Iraq, a
    tentative economic recovery, waning investor confidence and record low
    interest rates. How has the loan market responded in this climate?

A:  MR. REDDING: This has been a pivotal year in the loan market. Even as
    interest rates have continued to trend lower, the underlying fundamentals
    of the loan market have improved dramatically from last year, when the
    market suffered from the recession, a variety of corporate governance
    issues and the lingering aftermath of September 11. Credit conditions
    improved significantly in the first half of 2003. The economy has showed
    more vigor and companies are posting stronger earnings relative to last
    year's results. And, with "official hostilities" having ended in Iraq,
    consumer confidence appears to have been partially restored.

    The technical conditions within the loan market have also improved, as
    rising loan issuance has been met by stronger investor demand. Moreover,
    the loan market has benefited from its reputation as a very low-duration
    vehicle. While interest rates remain low, the improved business climate has
    helped loan values recover significantly, contributing to returns in recent
    months.

Scott H. Page

Q:  Scott, why was the recovery in loan values a significant development?

A:  MR. PAGE: It's noteworthy for several reasons. Loan values understandably
    declined during 2002, as the economic downturn impacted some companies'
    cash flows. However, while that was a fairly predictable part of the cycle,
    the loan market held up very well in the face of events that provided a
    major shock to other asset classes. It's also worth noting that the rise in
    loan values in the first half of 2003 suggests an upturn in the credit
    cycle. Finally, it helps confirm a trend that we have pointed out for some
    time: namely, the maturation of the loan market. Loan prices have responded
    to a gradual pick-up in economic activity, a move that further validates
    investors' confidence in the asset class.

Payson F. Swaffield

Q:  Payson, how would you evaluate the Trust's performance during the fiscal
    year?

A:  MR. SWAFFIELD: The Trust performed very well in this climate. Share price
    rose 14.9% alone and reflected the improvement in credit conditions and the
    overall loan market, with much of that improvement occurring in the first
    half of 2003. Not surprisingly, the Trust's monthly dividends declined
    somewhat during the year in response to the continued decline in short-term
    interest rates. However - even with the reduced dividends - the Trust had a
    market yield of 5.92% at June 30, 2003. That yield remains very competitive
    and well above most other income-producing investment vehicles.(1)

    On a net asset value basis, the Trust had a total return of 8.04%.(2) That
    return outperformed the 6.86% return of the benchmark CSFB Leveraged Loan
    Index.(3) The Trust benefited from its broad diversification across the
    improving economy. The Trust maintained an exposure to companies with
    defensive properties as well as more cyclical companies that will benefit
    from an upturn in overall economic activity.

Q:  What were the main drivers of performance during the fiscal year?

A:  MR. REDDING: The cable sector, the Trust's largest sector weighting, fared
    relatively well during the fiscal year. Cable has been attractive during
    the economic slowdown because, unlike the many industries that experience
    revenue shortfalls in a recession, cable companies have enjoyed fairly
    stable revenues. Put simply, customers tend to be very diligent about
    paying their cable bills. Cable operators have also created additional
    revenue sources by offering new services. At a time when subscriber growth
    rates have slowed somewhat, cable providers have been able to offer
    additional services, such as high-speed Internet and interactive functions.
    This has enabled companies to package services, adding revenue while
    providing a clear advantage for their customers.

    The Trust sharply pared its exposure to investment in Adelphia, a troubled
    cable provider. Irregularities and governance issues caused the company's
    loans to be valued lower, resulting in a slight loss to the Trust.

    In a related area, the Trust had investments in satellite broadcasters.
    Using a competing technology, satellite broadcasters target a similar
    market as cable and offer a broad range of options, including Internet,
    interactive and high definition television.

Q:  Casinos and gaming was another major sector weighting for the Trust. How
    has that area fared?

A:  MR. PAGE: The casino and gaming segment has held up relatively well during
    the economic slowdown. The Trust's investments included companies with
    exposure to the traditional Las Vegas destination resorts, as well as
    companies with properties in newer gaming jurisdictions. This latter
    strategy has served the industry well in the past year, as many families,
    concerned about geopolitical uncertainties, have opted for vacations closer
    to home. That has partially offset a slowdown in convention business. In
    addition, the "drive-to" casinos have not been as affected by the falloff
    in airline traffic. The Trust's investments have emphasized
    well-capitalized companies, for whom revenues held up well in a weak
    economy and whose free cash flow has remained relatively strong.

(1) The Trust's market yield is calculated by dividing the most recent dividend
    per share by the share market price at the end of the period and
    annualizing the result. (2) Returns are historical and are calculated by
    determining the percentage change in market value or net asset value with
    all distributions reinvested. (3) The CSFB Leveraged Loan Index is an
    unmanaged representative index of tradable, senior, secured, U.S.
    dollar-denominated leveraged loans. It is not possible to invest directly
    in an Index.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST AS OF JUNE 30, 2003

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION CONT'D
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:  Did any cyclical sectors contribute to performance?

A:  MR. SWAFFIELD: Yes. Publishing and printing was a significant investment
    for the Trust. This category includes a number of areas that could benefit
    from a stronger economy. Publishers of newspapers and trade magazines
    typically enjoy stronger advertising revenues in an economic recovery, as
    companies expand their marketing and ad budgets. In addition, newspaper
    companies may benefit from the approach of another presidential election
    year, which has historically boosted advertising linage. The Trust also has
    investments in printers that serve the financial and legal professions.

    The Trust's publishing investments also included publishers of "white and
    yellow page" directories. The increase in the number of local phone
    carriers during the 1990s was accompanied by a rise in the number of
    independent phone directories, a fairly costly venture for the phone
    companies. The past year has seen a trend toward divestiture of these
    directories, and their purchases by financial sponsors and/or publishers
    with more cost-effective production and marketing capabilities.

Q:  Were there any areas where the Trust has reduced its exposure?

A:  MR. REDDING: Yes. The Trust limited its exposure to the telecom sector. The
    Trust avoided the companies that were most adversely affected by the
    industry's woes and thus limited its losses in that troubled area. The
    difficulties of some companies - together with corporate governance issues
    - have depressed valuations somewhat within the sector, even among healthy
    companies, a trend that had a modestly adverse impact on the Fund.
    Competition within the industry remains fierce and, while the long-term
    demand for data, voice and video service appears promising, the shakeout
    within the industry is likely to continue for a while longer.

    Looking at the broader market, we believe that a stronger economy should
    lead to further improvement in credit conditions. In addition, if interest
    rates rise over time, the income returns of floating-rate returns will
    improve. That would help preserve purchasing power and make floating-rate
    loans a fairly effective hedge against a return of inflation.

(1) Senior floating rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash
    flows or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The degree to which
    borrowers repay, whether as a contractual requirement or at their election,
    cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual remaining
    maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    However, it is anticipated that the senior floating- rate interests will
    have an expected average life of approximately two to four years.
(2) Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
    1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
    registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.
(3) Priced by adviser.
(4) Non-income producing security.

Note: At June 30, 2003, the Trust had unfunded commitments amounting to
      $9,630,471 under various revolving credit agreements.

(1) Net investment income per share was computed using average shares outstanding.
(2) The Trust has adopted the provisions of the revised AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies and began using
    the interest method to amortize premiums on fixed-income securities. The effect of this change for the year ended June 30, 2002
    was to increase net investment income per share by $0.001, increase net realized and unrealized losses per share by $0.001, and
    increase the ratio of net investment income to average net assets attributable to common shares by less than 0.01%. Per share
    data and ratios for the periods prior to July 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this change in presentation.
(3) For the period from the start of business, October 30, 1998, to June 30, 1999.
(4) Returns are historical and are calculated by determing the percentage change in market value with all distributions reinvested.
    Total return is not computed on an annualized basis.
(5) Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to preferred shareholders. Ratios to average net assets attributable to
    common shares reflect the Trust's leveraged capital structure.
(6) Annualized.
(7) Calculated by subtracting the Trust's total liabilities (not including the preferred shares) from the Trust's total assets, and
    dividing this by the number of preferred shares outstanding.
(8) Plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST AS OF JUNE 30, 2003

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 Significant Accounting Policies
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust (the Trust) is an entity commonly known as a
  Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
  Act of 1940 as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.
  The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current
  income consistent with the preservation of capital, by investing primarily
  in senior, floating rate loans. The following is a summary of significant
  accounting policies consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of
  its financial statements. The policies are in conformity with accounting
  principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for presentation purposes.

  A Investment Valuation -- The Trust's investments are primarily in interests
  in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). Certain Senior Loans are
  deemed liquid because reliable market quotations are readily available for
  them. Liquid loans are valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing
  service. Other Senior Loans are valued at fair value by the Trust's
  investment adviser, Eaton Vance Management (EVM), under procedures
  established by the Trustees as permitted by Section 2(a)(41) of the
  Investment Company Act of 1940. Such procedures include the consideration of
  relevant factors, data and information relating to fair value, including (i)
  the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data relating to the
  Senior Loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate, period until
  next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate of the Senior Loan,
  the terms and conditions of the Senior Loan and any related agreements and
  the position of the loan in the borrower's debt structure; (ii) the nature,
  adequacy and value of the collateral, including the Trust's rights, remedies
  and interests with respect to the collateral; (iii) the creditworthiness of
  the Borrower, based on evaluations of its financial condition, financial
  statements and information about the Borrower's business, cash flows,
  capital structure and future prospects; (iv) information relating to the
  market for the Senior Loan including price quotations for and trading in the
  Senior Loan and interests in similar loans and the market environment and
  investor attitudes towards the Senior Loan and interests in similar loans;
  (v) the experience, reputation, stability and financial condition of the
  agent and any intermediate participant in the loan; and (vi) general
  economic and market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan.
  Non-loan portfolio holdings (other than short-term obligations, but
  including listed issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by
  one or more pricing services which determine prices for normal,
  institutional-size trading units of such securities using market
  information, transactions for comparable securities and various
  relationships between securities which are generally recognized by
  institutional traders. In certain circumstances, portfolio securities will
  be valued at the last sales price on the exchange that is the primary market
  for such securities, or the average of the last quoted bid price and asked
  price for those securities for which the over-the-counter market is the
  primary market or for listed securities in which there were no sales during
  the day. Marketable securities listed in the NASDAQ National Market System
  are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. The value of interest rate
  swaps will be based upon a dealer quotation. Short-term obligations which
  mature in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, if their original
  term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was 60 days or less, or are
  valued at amortized cost using their value on the 61st day prior to
  maturity, if their original term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was
  more then 60 days, unless in each case this is determined not to represent
  fair value. Repurchase agreements are valued at cost plus accrued interest.
  Other portfolio securities for which there are no quotations or valuations
  are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or on behalf of the
  Trustees.

  B Income -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual
  basis at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is
  determined on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of
  premium or discount. Facility fees received are recognized as income over
  the expected term of the loan. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-
  dividend date for dividends received in cash and/or securities.

  C Federal Taxes -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of
  the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and
  to distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including
  any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal
  income or excise tax is necessary. At June 30, 2003, the Trust, for federal
  income tax purposes, had a capital loss carryover of
  $43,194,563, which will expire on June 30, 2009
  ($1,925,241), June 30, 2010 ($27,557,475) and June 30, 2011 ($13,711,847).
  These amounts will reduce the Trust's taxable income arising from future net
  realized gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the
  Internal Revenue Code and thus will reduce the amount of the distributions
  to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Trust of
  any liability for federal income or excise tax.

  Additionally, at June 30, 2003, the Trust had net capital losses of
  $3,925,798 attributable to security transactions incurred after October 31,
  2002. These are treated as arising on the first day of the Trust's next
  taxable year.

  D Expense Reduction -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
  custodian of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
  fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
  balances the Trust maintains with IBT. All significant credit balances used
  to reduce the Trust's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses
  on the Statement of Operations.

  E Use of Estimates -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
  with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
  America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
  statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
  reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

  F Other -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the
  investments are purchased or sold. Gains and losses on securities sold are
  determined on the basis of identified cost.

2 Auction Preferred Shares (APS)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Trust issued 2,200 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A and 2,200
  shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B on June 27, 2001 in a public
  offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded
  as a reduction to paid in capital. Dividends on the APS, which accrue daily,
  are paid cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering of the
  APS and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction. Dividend
  rates at June 30, 2003 were 1.18% and 1.13% for Series A and Series B
  Shares, respectively. Series A and Series B are identical in all respects
  except for the dates of reset for the dividend rates.

  The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, at a redemption price
  equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
  dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
  redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
  dividends, if the Trust is in default on its asset maintenance requirements
  with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in
  an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a
  class have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In
  general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have equal voting
  rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the APS, as a
  separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the Board of
  Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus
  accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required to maintain certain
  asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the Trust's By-Laws.
  The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares'
  liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
  auctions.

3 Distributions to Shareholders
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Trust intends to make monthly distributions to common shareholders of
  net investment income, after payment of any dividends on any outstanding
  preferred shares. Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
  Distributions to preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable
  at the end of each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the
  Auction Preferred Shares is generally seven days. The applicable dividend
  rate for the Auction Preferred Shares on June 30, 2003 was 1.18% and 1.13%,
  for Series A and Series B Shares, respectively. For the year ended June 30,
  2003, the Trust paid dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders amounting
  to $809,204 and $803,352 for Series A and Series B Shares, respectively,
  representing an average APS dividend rate for such period of 1.45% and
  1.44%, respectively.

4 Common Shares of Beneficial Interest
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Agreement and Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
  unlimited number of full and fractional $0.01 par value common shares of
  beneficial interest. Transactions in common shares were as follows:

                                          Year Ended June 30,
                                        ------------------------

  Issued to shareholders electing to
    receive payments of
    distributions in Fund common
    shares                               95,799         81,797
  --------------------------------------------------------------
  Net increase                           95,799         81,797
  --------------------------------------------------------------

5 Investment Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with Affiliates
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The investment adviser fee, computed at a monthly rate of 17/240 of 1%
  (0.85% annually) of the Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by
  EVM as compensation for management and investment advisory services rendered
  to the Trust. For the year ended June 30, 2003, the fee was equivalent to
  0.85% of the Trust's average weekly gross assets and amounted to $4,379,968.
  Except for Trustees of the Trust who are not members of EVM's organization,
  officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services to the Trust
  out of such investment adviser fee. EVM also serves as the administrator of
  the Trust. An administration fee, computed at the monthly rate of 1/48
  of 1% (0.25% annually) of the average weekly gross assets of the Trust, is
  paid to EVM for managing and administering business affairs of the Trust.
  For the year ended June 30, 2003, the fee was equivalent to 0.25% of the
  Trust's average weekly gross assets for such period and amounted to
  $1,288,226.

  Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of the above
  organization.

6 Investment Transactions
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Trust invests primarily in Senior Loans. The ability of the issuers of
  the Senior Loans held by the Trust to meet their obligations may be affected
  by economic developments in a specific industry. The cost of purchases and
  the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of Senior Loans and
  corporate bonds aggregated $298,813,679 and $281,787,458, respectively, for
  the year ended June 30, 2003.

7 Short-Term Debt and Credit Agreements
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The Trust has entered into a revolving credit agreement that will allow the
  Trust to borrow $120 million to support the issuance of commercial paper and
  to permit the Trust to invest in accordance with its investment practices.
  Interest is charged under the revolving credit agreement at the bank's base
  rate or at an amount above either the bank's adjusted certificate of deposit
  rate or federal funds effective rate. Interest expense includes commercial
  paper program fees of approximately $310,000 and a commitment fee of
  approximately $183,000 which is computed at the annual rate of 0.15% on the
  unused portion of the revolving credit agreement. There were no significant
  borrowings under this agreement during the period. As of June 30, 2003, the
  Trust had commercial paper outstanding of $118,000,000, at an interest rate
  of 1.16%. Maximum and average borrowings for the year ended June 30, 2003
  were $118,000,000 and $108,035,616, respectively, and the average interest
  rate was 1.50%.

8 Federal Income Tax Basis of Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation)
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  The cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in value of the
  investment securities at June 30, 2003, as computed on a federal income tax
  basis, were as follows:

  Aggregate cost$533,774,430
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Gross unrealized appreciation                                $  4,743,064
  Gross unrealized depreciation                                 (10,923,810)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Net unrealized depreciation                                  $ (6,180,746)
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

9 Subsequent Event
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  At their June 2003 Board meeting, the Trustees of the Trust appointed two new
  Trustees, William H. Park and Ronald A. Pearlman, to replace Jack L. Treynor
  and Donald R. Dwight, respectively, as Trustees of the Trust, such
  appointments being effective upon Mr. Treynor's and Mr. Dwight's retirement.
  As of July 1, 2003, both Mr. Treynor and Mr. Dwight had retired from the

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Trustees and Shareholders
of Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the portfolio of investments, of Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust
(the Trust) as of June 30, 2003, and the related statements of operations and
cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets
for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2003, and the
financial highlights for each of the years in the four year period then ended
June 30, 2003 and for the period from October 30, 1998 to June 30, 1999. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Trust's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. Our procedures included confirmation of securities and Senior
Loans owned at June 30, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian, brokers and
selling or agent banks; where replies were not received from brokers and
selling or agent banks, we performed other auditing procedures. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights, referred
to above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust at June 30, 2003, and the results of its
operations, the changes in its net assets, its cash flows and its financial
highlights for the respective stated periods in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

DIDIVEND REINVESTMENT PLAN
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the
Plan Agent.

Any inquires regarding the Plan can be directed to the Plan Agent, PFPC Inc.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The registrant's Board has adopted a proxy voting policy and procedure (the
"Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated proxy voting
responsibility to the registrant's investment adviser and adopted the
investment adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies")
which are described below. The Trustees will review the registrant's proxy
voting records from time to time and will annually consider approving the
Policies for the upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises
between the registrant's shareholders and the investment adviser, the
administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the registrant,
the investment adviser will generally refrain from voting the proxies related
to the companies giving rise to such conflict until it consults with the
Board's Special Committee except as contemplated under the Fund Policy. The
Special Committee will instruct the investment adviser on the appropriate
course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management
to its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment adviser may abstain from
voting from time to time where it determines that the costs associated with
voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from exercising the right to
vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in
a conflict of interest between the registrant's shareholders and the investment
adviser, the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the
registrant by maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective
corporate clients. The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing
and voting proxies on behalf of the registrant will report any proxy received
or expected to be received from a company included on that list to the
