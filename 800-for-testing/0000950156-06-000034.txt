LETTER FROM THE CEO

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

Dear Shareholders,
Most investors are familiar with the basic principles of investing - focus on
the long term and keep your assets diversified across different investment
categories. Still, it is surprising how often we forget these basic lessons.
Certainly, the dot-com euphoria that overtook Wall Street in the late 1990s
had many people hoping they could become millionaires overnight. But the
market decline that started in the spring of 2000 taught everyone how
misguided those hopes had been.

Now, less than five years after the market taught a harsh lesson in the
follies of speculative investing, we are seeing a number of trends that
suggest many investors, including professionals, are hoping for overnight
miracles again. We see a steady stream of market "gurus" on television news
shows, promising to teach amateur investors the strategies that will allow
them to get rich quick. Hedge funds - which by their nature move in and out of
investments rapidly - have soared in popularity over the past five years. We
are reminded every day that we live in a "what have you done for me lately?"
world, but this mindset should not influence how we invest and manage our
money. In fact, investors often fall short of their goals because they trade
in and out of investments too frequently and at inopportune times.

Throughout our entire 80-year history, MFS" money management process has
focused on long-term investment opportunities. We firmly believe that one of
the best ways to realize long-term financial goals - be it a college
education, a comfortable retirement, or a secure family legacy - is to follow
a three-pronged approach that focuses on longer time horizons. Allocate
holdings across the major asset classes - including stocks, bonds, and cash.
Diversify within each class to take advantage of different market segments and
investing styles. And rebalance  assets regularly to maintain a  desired asset
allocation.*

This long-term approach requires diligence and patience, two traits that in
our experience are essential to capitalizing on the many opportunities the
financial markets can offer.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

    Robert J. Manning
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer
    MFS Investment Management(R)

January 17, 2006

* Asset allocation, diversification, and rebalancing does not guarantee a
  profit or protect against a loss. The opinions expressed in this letter are
  those of MFS, and no forecasts can be guaranteed.

* For purposes of this graphical presentation, the bond component includes
  both accrued interest amounts and the equivalent exposure from any
  derivative holdings, if applicable.

# Each security is assigned a rating from Moody's Investors Service. If not
  rated by Moody's, the rating will be that assigned by Standard & Poor's.
  Likewise, if not assigned a rating by Standard & Poor's, it will be based on
  the rating assigned by Fitch, Inc. For those portfolios that hold a security
  which is not rated by any of the three agencies, the security is considered
  Not Rated. Holdings in U.S. Treasuries and government agency mortgage-backed
  securities, if any, are included in a "AAA"-rating category. Percentages are
  based on the total market value of investments as of 11/30/05.

^ Duration is a measure of how much a bond fund's price is likely to fluctuate
  with general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a fund
  with a 5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of
  its value.

@ The average maturity shown is calculated using the final stated maturity on
  the portfolio's holdings without taking into account any holdings which have
  been pre-refunded to an earlier date or which have a mandatory put date
  prior to the stated maturity. The average life shown takes into account
  these earlier dates.

+ The average credit quality of rated securities is based upon a market
  weighted average of portfolio holdings that are rated by public rating
  agencies.

The fund's negative cash balance is due to either the timing of trade
settlements or the portfolio's use of forwards, futures, or options.

Percentages are based on net assets as of 11/30/05, unless otherwise noted.

The portfolio is actively managed, and current holdings may be different.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For the twelve months ended November 30, 2005, the MFS Government Markets
Income Trust provided a total return of 2.67%, at net asset value. In
comparison, the trust's benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Government/
Mortgage Index, returned 2.48%.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

The trust's shorter duration (duration is a measure of a portfolio's
sensitivity to changes in interest rates) stance aided results relative to the
Lehman Brothers Government/Mortgage Index. Over the period, the portfolio took
on a more defensive posture, believing that interest rates were more likely to
increase rather than decrease. In comparison to the index, the trust had a
smaller concentration of bonds with longer maturities. Elsewhere, positioning
in agency related securities and mortgages issued by Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae
generated strong results. Holdings of debt of emerging markets contributed
over the period as well.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

The trust's Japanese, Euro, and Swedish currency exposures along with
positioning in sovereign European debt acted as a drag on performance. Over
the period the dollar continued its appreciation against most major
currencies, this hurt returns on any currency positions and unhedged foreign
denominated bonds. During the period, the Lehman Brothers Government/
Mortgage Index enjoyed a yield advantage over the trust. The index generated a
higher level of income over the period, this too impacted performance.

INDEX DEFINITION

Lehman Brothers Government/Mortgage Index - measures debt issued by the U.S.
Government as well as mortgage-backed pass-through securities of Ginnie Mae
(GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC).

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount or premium to net asset value.
Shareholders do not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their
shares at net asset value.

When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the net asset value
underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive less
than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As a
result, the total return that is calculated based on the net asset value and
New York Stock Exchange price can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes
as a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her
shares and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be
treated as gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of
shareholder capital have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and
increasing the trust's
expense ratio.

From time to time the trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements,
without which performance would be lower.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

The portfolio's yield and share prices change daily based on the credit
quality of its investments and changes in interest rates. In general, the
value of debt securities will decline when interest rates rise and will
increase when interest rates fall. Debt securities with longer maturity dates
will be subject to greater price fluctuations than those with shorter
maturities. Mortgage securities are subject to prepayment risk which can offer
less potential for gains in a declining interest rate environment and greater
potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment. Derivatives involve
risks different from, and greater than, those of the underlying indicator's in
whose value the derivative is based. The value of the derivative can move in
unexpected ways and result in unanticipated losses and increased volatility if
the value of the underlying indicator(s) does not move in the direction or the
extent anticipated Foreign investments are more susceptible to risks relating
to interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic and political risks
and can be more volatile than U.S. investments. When you sell your shares,
they may be worth more or less than the amount you paid for them.

These risks can increase share price volatility.

In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on
such terms as the Trustees shall determine.
<PAGE>

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows
you to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If
the shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted
price of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is
greater. Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in
any amount over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or
shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee,
you can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If
the nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares
be re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please
have available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security
numbers. For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts,
instructions must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details.
When you withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested
shares in one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional
shares, or a certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional
shares.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATION

MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the trust) is organized as a Massachusetts
business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, as a closed-end management investment company.

(2) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The trust
can invest in foreign securities. Investments in foreign securities are
vulnerable to the effects of changes in the relative values of the local
currency and the U.S. dollar and to the effects of changes in each country's
legal, political, and economic environment.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Debt instruments (other than short-term instruments),
including restricted debt instruments, are generally valued at an evaluated bid
price as reported by an independent pricing service. Values of debt instruments
obtained from pricing services can utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and
electronic data processing techniques which take into account factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data. Short-term instruments with a maturity at issuance of 365 days or less are
generally valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Futures
contracts are generally valued at settlement price as reported by an independent
pricing service on the exchange on which they are primarily traded. For futures
contracts in which there were no sales during the day, futures contracts are
generally valued at the last quoted bid price as reported by an independent
pricing service on the exchange on which they are primarily traded. Forward
foreign currency contracts are generally valued at the mean of bid and asked
prices based on rates reported by an independent pricing service. Securities and
other assets generally valued on the basis of information from an independent
pricing service may also be valued on the basis of information from brokers and
dealers. The values of foreign securities and other assets and liabilities
expressed in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars based upon
exchange rates provided by an independent source. When pricing-service
information or market quotations are not readily available, securities are
priced at fair value as determined under the direction of the Board of Trustees.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the trust's investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The trust requires
that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be transferred to the
custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the trust to obtain those securities
in the event of a default under the repurchase agreement. The trust monitors, on
a daily basis, the value of the collateral to ensure that its value, including
accrued interest, is greater than amounts owed to the trust under each such
repurchase agreement. The trust, along with other affiliated entities of
Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS), may utilize a joint trading
account for the purpose of entering into one or more repurchase agreements.

INFLATION-ADJUSTED DEBT SECURITIES - The trust invests in inflation-adjusted
debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury. The trust may also invest in
inflation-adjusted debt securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and
instrumentalities other than the U.S. Treasury and by other entities such as
U.S. and foreign corporations and foreign governments. The principal value of
these debt securities is adjusted by references to changes in the Consumer Price
Index or another general price or wage index. These debt securities typically
pay a fixed rate of interest, but this fixed rate is applied to the
inflation-adjusted principal amount. The principal paid at maturity of the debt
security is typically equal to the inflation-adjusted principal amount, or the
security's original par value, whichever is greater. Other types of
inflation-adjusted securities may use other methods to adjust for other measures
of inflation.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Purchases and sales of foreign investments,
income, and expenses are converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency
exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Gains
and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange rates on sales of
securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains
and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to foreign exchange
rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for financial statement
purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. That portion of both
realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.

DERIVATIVE RISK - The trust may invest in derivatives for hedging or non-
hedging purposes. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also
reduce or eliminate gains. When the trust uses derivatives as an investment to
gain market exposure, or for hedging purposes, gains and losses from derivative
instruments may be substantially greater than the derivative's original cost.
Derivative instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts and
futures contracts.

FUTURES CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into futures contracts for the delayed
delivery of securities or currency, or contracts based on financial indices at a
fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the trust is required
to deposit with the broker either in cash or securities an amount equal to a
certain percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are made or
received by the trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value
of the contract, and are recorded for financial statement purposes as unrealized
gains or losses by the trust. Upon entering into such contracts, the trust bears
the risk of interest or exchange rates or securities prices moving unexpectedly,
in which case, the trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the futures
contracts and may realize a loss.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to
meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value
of the contract. The trust may enter into forward foreign currency exchange
contracts for hedging purposes as well as for non-hedging purposes. For hedging
purposes, the trust may enter into contracts to deliver or receive foreign
currency it will receive from or require for its normal investment activities.
The trust may also use contracts in a manner intended to protect foreign
currency denominated securities from declines in value due to unfavorable
exchange rate movements. For non-hedging purposes, the trust may enter into
contracts with the intent of changing the relative exposure of the trust's
portfolio of securities to different currencies to take advantage of anticipated
changes. The forward foreign currency exchange contracts are adjusted by the
daily exchange rate of the underlying currency and any gains or losses are
recorded as unrealized until the contract settlement date. On contract
settlement date, the gains or losses are recorded as realized gains or losses on
foreign currency transactions.

DOLLAR ROLL TRANSACTIONS - The trust enters into dollar roll transactions, with
respect to mortgage backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and
Freddie Mac, in which the trust sells mortgage backed securities to financial
institutions and simultaneously agrees to accept substantially similar (same
type, coupon, and maturity) securities at a later date at an agreed-upon price.
During the period between the sale and repurchase in a dollar roll transaction
the trust will not be entitled to receive interest and principal payments on the
securities sold but is compensated by interest earned on the proceeds of the
initial sale and by a lower purchase price on the securities to be repurchased
which enhances the trust's total return. The trust accounts for dollar roll
transactions as purchases and sales. If certain criteria are met these dollar
roll transactions may be considered a financing transaction whereby the
difference in the sales price and the future purchase price is recorded as an
adjustment to interest income.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on the
trade date. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premium and
discount is amortized or accreted for financial statement purposes in accordance
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. All discount is accreted for
tax reporting purposes as required by federal income tax regulations.

The trust may receive proceeds from litigation settlements involving its
portfolio holdings. Any proceeds received are reflected in realized gain/loss in
the Statement of Operations, or in unrealized gain/loss if the security is still
held by the trust.

The trust may enter into "TBA" (to be announced) purchase commitments to
purchase securities for a fixed unit price at a future date. Although the unit
price has been established, the principal value has not been finalized. However,
the principal amount of the commitments will not fluctuate more than 0.01%. The
trust holds, and maintains until settlement date, cash or high- grade debt
obligations in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase price, or the trust may
enter into offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other securities it
owns. Income on the securities will not be earned until settlement date. TBA
purchase commitments may be considered securities in themselves, and involve a
risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased declines prior to
settlement date, which is in addition to the risk of decline in the value of the
trust's other assets. Unsettled TBA purchase commitments are valued at the
current market value of the underlying securities.

The trust may enter into "TBA" (to be announced) sale commitments to hedge its
portfolio positions or to sell mortgage-backed securities it owns under delayed
delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA sale commitments are not received until
the contractual settlement date. During the time a TBA sale commitment is
outstanding, equivalent deliverable securities, or an offsetting TBA purchase
commitment deliverable on or before the sale commitment date, are held as
"cover" for the transaction.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
trust. This amount, for the year ended November 30, 2005, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net taxable
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the financial
statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for foreign currency transactions, amortization and accretion on debt
securities, derivatives, straddle loss deferrals, and wash sales.

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended November 30,
2005 and November 30, 2004 was as follows:

                                             11/30/05            11/30/04
Distributions declared from:
  Ordinary income                         $16,936,571         $17,946,379

During the year ended November 30, 2005, undistributed net investment income
increased by $4,329,921, accumulated net realized loss on investments and
foreign currency transactions decreased by $2,446,128, and paid-in capital
decreased by $6,776,049 due to differences between book and tax accounting for
foreign currency transactions, expiration of capital loss carry forward, and
amortization and accretion on debt securities. This change had no effect on the
net assets or net asset value per share.

As of November 30, 2005, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

          Undistributed ordinary income                         $2,880,349
          Capital loss carryforward                            (21,219,412)
          Unrealized appreciation (depreciation)                (8,755,619)
          Other temporary differences                             (753,251)

For federal income tax purposes, the capital loss carryforward may be applied
against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the
earlier of its utilization or expiration as follows:

          EXPIRATION DATE

          November 30, 2007                           $(11,594,208)
          November 30, 2008                             (5,988,179)
          November 30, 2012                             (3,637,025)
          --------------------------------------------------------
          Total                                       $(21,219,412)

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with MFS to
provide overall investment advisory and administrative services, and general
office facilities. The management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an
annual rate of 0.32% of the trust's average daily net assets and 5.33% of gross
investment income. The management fee, from net assets and gross investment
income, incurred for the year ended November 30, 2005 was equivalent to an
annual effective rate of 0.61% of the trust's average daily net assets.

TRANSFER AGENT - The trust pays a portion of transfer agent and dividend-
disbursing costs to MFS Service Center, Inc. (MFSC), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of MFS. MFSC receives a fee from the trust, for its services as registrar and
dividend-disbursing agent. The agreement provides that the trust will pay MFSC
an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00 and a dividend services fee of
$0.75 per reinvestment. For the year ended November 30, 2005, these fees
amounted to $111,046. MFSC also receives payment from the trust for out-of-
pocket expenses paid by MFSC on behalf of the trust. For the year ended November
30, 2005, these costs amounted to $60,622.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to certain funds
for which MFS acts as investment adviser. Under an administrative services
agreement, the funds may partially reimburse MFS the costs incurred to provide
these services, subject to review and approval by the Board of Trustees. Each
fund is charged a fixed amount plus a fee based on calendar year average net
assets. Effective July 1, 2005, the fund's annual fixed amount is $10,000.

The administrative services fee incurred for the year ended November 30, 2005
was equivalent to an annual effective rate of 0.0123% of the trust's average
daily net assets.

TRUSTEES" AND OFFICERS" COMPENSATION - The trust pays compensation to
Independent Trustees in the form of a retainer, attendance fees, and additional
compensation to Board and Committee chairpersons. The trust does not pay
compensation directly to Trustees who are officers of the investment adviser, or
to officers of the trust, all of whom receive remuneration for their services to
the trust from MFS. Certain officers and Trustees of the trust are officers or
directors of MFS and MFSC. The trust has an unfunded, defined benefit plan for
retired Independent Trustees which resulted in a pension expense of $19,054. The
trust also has an unfunded retirement benefit deferral plan for certain current
Independent Trustees which resulted in an expense of $986. Both amounts are
included in Independent trustees" compensation for the year ended November 30,
2005.

DEFERRED TRUSTEE COMPENSATION - Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan)
Independent Trustees previously were allowed to elect to defer receipt of all or
a portion of their annual compensation. Trustees are no longer allowed to defer
compensation under the Plan. Amounts previously deferred are treated as though
equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the trust or other MFS
funds selected by the Trustee. Deferred amounts represent an unsecured
obligation of the trust until distributed in accordance with the Plan. Included
in other assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities, is $12,448 of
Deferred Trustees" Compensation.

OTHER - This trust and certain other MFS funds (the funds) have entered into a
services agreement (the Agreement) which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an Independent
Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an officer of the
funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. MFS has agreed to reimburse the fund
for a portion of the payments made by the funds to Tarantino LLC in the amount
of $1,718, which is shown as a reduction of total expenses in the Statement of
Operations. Additionally, MFS has agreed to bear all expenses associated with
office space, other administrative support, and supplies provided to the ICCO.
The funds can terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the
terms of the Agreement.

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other affiliated funds participate in a $1 billion unsecured
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a credit agreement.
Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is charged to
each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the Federal Reserve
funds rate plus 0.35%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the average
daily, unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. The commitment fee
allocated to the trust for the year ended November 30, 2005 was $2,501, and is
included in miscellaneous expense on the Statement of Operations. The trust
had no significant borrowings during the year ended November 30, 2005.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and the Shareholders of
MFS Government Markets Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the
"Trust") as of November 30, 2005, and the related statement of operations for
the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two
years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits
included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis
for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures
included confirmation of securities owned as of November 30, 2005, by
correspondence with the custodian. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS Government
Markets Income Trust as of November 30, 2005, the results of its operations for
the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in
the period then ended, and its financial highlights for each of the five years
in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that both the full Board of Trustees
and a majority of the non-interested ("independent") Trustees, voting
separately, annually approve the continuation of the MFS Government Markets
Income Trust's (the "Fund's") investment advisory agreement with MFS. The
Trustees consider matters bearing on the Fund and its advisory arrangements at
their meetings throughout the year, including a review of performance data at
each regular meeting. In addition, the independent Trustees met several times
over the course of three months beginning in May and ending in July, 2005
("contract review meetings") for the specific purpose of considering whether to
approve the continuation of the investment advisory agreement for the Fund and
the other investment companies that the Board oversees (the "MFS Funds"). The
independent Trustees were assisted in their evaluation of the Fund's investment
advisory agreement by independent legal counsel, from whom they received
separate legal advice and with whom they met separately from MFS during various
contract review meetings. The independent Trustees were also assisted in this
process by the MFS Funds" Independent Chief Compliance Officer, a full-time
senior officer appointed by and reporting to the independent Trustees.

In connection with their deliberations regarding the continuation of the
investment advisory agreement, the Trustees, including the independent Trustees,
considered such information and factors as they believed, in light of the legal
advice furnished to them and their own business judgment, to be relevant. The
investment advisory agreement for the Fund was considered separately, although
the Trustees also took into account the common interests of all MFS Funds in
their review. As described below, the Trustees considered the nature, quality,
and extent of the various investment advisory, administrative, and shareholder
services performed by MFS under the existing investment advisory agreement and
other arrangements with the Fund.

In connection with their contract review meetings, the Trustees received and
relied upon materials which included, among other items: (i) information
provided by Lipper Inc. on the investment performance (based on net asset value)
of the Fund for various time periods ended December 31, 2004 and the investment
performance (based on net asset value) of a group of funds with substantially
similar investment classifications/objectives (the "Lipper performance
universe"), as well as the investment performance (based on net asset value) of
a group of funds identified by objective criteria suggested by MFS ("peer
funds"), (ii) information provided by Lipper Inc. on the Fund's advisory fees
and other expenses and the advisory fees and other expenses of comparable funds
identified by Lipper (the "Lipper expense group"), as well as the advisory fees
and other expenses of peer funds identified by objective criteria suggested by
MFS, (iii) information provided by MFS on the advisory fees of comparable
portfolios of other clients of MFS, including institutional separate account and
other clients, (iv) information as to whether and to what extent applicable
expense waivers, reimbursements or fee "breakpoints" are observed for the Fund,
(v) information regarding MFS" financial results and financial condition,
including MFS" and certain of its affiliates' estimated profitability from
services performed for the Fund and the MFS Funds as a whole, (vi) MFS' views
regarding the outlook for the mutual fund industry and the strategic business
plans of MFS, (vii) descriptions of various functions performed by MFS for the
Funds, such as compliance monitoring and portfolio trading practices, and (viii)
information regarding the overall organization of MFS, including information
about MFS' senior management and other personnel providing investment advisory,
administrative and other services to the Fund and the other MFS Funds. The
comparative performance, fee and expense information prepared and provided by
Lipper Inc. was not independently verified and the independent Trustees did not
independently verify any information provided to them by MFS.

The Trustees' conclusion as to the continuation of the investment advisory
agreement was based on a comprehensive consideration of all information provided
to the Trustees and not the result of any single factor. Some of the factors
that figured particularly in the Trustees' deliberations are described below,
although individual Trustees may have evaluated the information presented
differently from one another, giving different weights to various factors. It is
also important to recognize that the fee arrangements for the Fund and other MFS
Funds are the result of years of review and discussion between the independent
Trustees and MFS, that certain aspects of such arrangements may receive greater
scrutiny in some years than others, and that the Trustees' conclusions may be
based, in part, on their consideration of these same arrangements during the
course of the year and in prior years.

Based on information provided by Lipper Inc. and MFS, the Trustees reviewed the
Fund's total return investment performance as well as the performance of peer
groups of funds over various time periods. The Trustees placed particular
emphasis on the total return performance of the Fund's common shares in
comparison to the performance of funds in its Lipper performance universe over
the three-year period ended December 31, 2004, which the Trustees believed was a
long enough period to reflect differing market conditions. The Fund's
performance was in the 40th percentile relative to the other funds in the
universe for this three-year period (the 1st percentile being the best
performers and the 100th percentile being the worst performers). The total
return performance of the Fund's common shares was also in the 40th percentile
for each of the one- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2004 relative to
the Lipper performance universe. Because of the passage of time, these
performance results are likely to differ from the performance results for more
recent periods, including those shown elsewhere in this report.

In the course of their deliberations, the Trustees took into account information
provided by MFS in connection with the contract review meetings, as well as
during investment review meetings conducted with portfolio management personnel
during the course of the year regarding the Fund's performance. After reviewing
these and related factors, the Trustees concluded, within the context of their
overall conclusions regarding the investment advisory agreement, that they were
satisfied with MFS' responses and efforts relating to investment performance.

In assessing the reasonableness of the Fund's advisory fee, the Trustees
considered, among other information, the Fund's advisory fee and the total
expense ratio of the Fund's common shares as a percentage of average net assets
and the advisory fee and total expense ratios of peer groups of funds based on
information provided by Lipper Inc. and MFS. The Trustees considered whether the
Fund was subject to any fee waivers or reductions or expense limitations. The
Trustees also considered that, according to the Lipper data, the Fund's
effective advisory fee rate and total expense ratio each were at the Lipper
expense group median.

The Trustees also considered the advisory fees charged by MFS to institutional
accounts. In comparing these fees, the Trustees considered information provided
by MFS as to the generally broader scope of services provided by MFS to the Fund
in comparison to institutional accounts and the impact on MFS and expenses
associated with the more extensive regulatory regime to which the Fund is
subject in comparison to institutional accounts.

The Trustees considered that, as a closed-end fund, the Fund is unlikely to
experience meaningful asset growth. As a result, the Trustees did not view the
potential for realization of economies of scale as the Fund's assets grow to be
a material factor in their deliberations. The Trustees noted that they would
consider economies of scale in the future in the event the Fund experiences
significant asset growth, such as through an offering of preferred shares (which
is not currently contemplated) or a material increase in the market value of the
Fund's portfolio securities.

The Trustees also considered information prepared by MFS relating to MFS' costs
and profits with respect to the Fund, the MFS Funds considered as a group, and
other investment companies and accounts advised by MFS, as well as MFS'
methodologies used to determine and allocate its costs to the MFS Funds, the
Fund and other accounts and products for purposes of estimating profitability.

After reviewing these and other factors described herein, the Trustees
concluded, within the context of their overall conclusions regarding the
investment advisory agreement, that the advisory fees charged to the Fund
represent reasonable compensation in light of the nature and quality of the
services being provided by MFS to the Fund.

In addition, the Trustees considered MFS' resources and related efforts to
continue to retain, attract and motivate capable personnel to serve the Fund.
The Trustees also considered current and developing conditions in the financial
services industry, including the entry into the industry of large and
well-capitalized companies which are spending, and appear to be prepared to
continue to spend, substantial sums to engage personnel and to provide services
to competing investment companies. In this regard, the Trustees also considered
the financial resources of MFS and its ultimate parent, Sun Life Financial Inc.
The Trustees also considered the advantages and possible disadvantages to the
Fund of having an adviser which also serves other investment companies as well
as other accounts.

The Trustees also considered the nature, quality, cost, and extent of
administrative services provided to the Fund by MFS under agreements other than
the investment advisory agreement. The Trustees also considered the nature,
extent and quality of certain other services MFS performs or arranges for on the
Fund's behalf, including securities lending programs, directed expense payment
programs, class action recovery programs, and MFS' interaction with third-party
service providers, principally custodians and sub-custodians. The Trustees
concluded that the various non-advisory services provided by MFS and its
affiliates on behalf of the Funds were satisfactory.

The Trustees also considered benefits to MFS from the use of the Fund's
portfolio brokerage commissions to pay for research and other similar services
(including MFS' general policy to pay directly for third-party research), and
various other factors. Additionally, the Trustees considered so-called "fall-
out benefits" to MFS such as reputational value derived from serving as
investment manager to the Fund.

Based on their evaluation of factors that they deemed to be material, including
those factors described above, the Board of Trustees, including a majority of
the independent Trustees, concluded that the Fund's investment advisory
agreement with MFS should be continued for an additional one-year period,
commencing August 1, 2005.

investment advisory agreement is available by visiting the Closed-End section of

  * This amount reflects the fees billed to MFS and MFS Related Entities for non-audit services relating directly to
    the operations and financial reporting of the Fund (portions of which services also related to the operations and
    financial reporting of other funds within the MFS Funds complex).

  # This amount reflects the aggregate fees billed by Deloitte for non-audit services rendered to the Fund and for
    non-audit services rendered to MFS and the MFS Related Entities.

(1) The fees included under "Audit-Related Fees" are fees related to assurance and related services that are
    reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of financial statements, but not reported under
    "Audit Fees," including accounting consultations, agreed-upon procedure reports, attestation reports, comfort
    letters and internal control reviews.

(2) The fees included under "Tax Fees" are fees associated with tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning, including
    services relating to the filing or amendment of federal, state or local income tax returns, regulated investment
    company qualification reviews and tax distribution and analysis.

(3) The fees included under "All Other Fees" are fees for products and services provided by Deloitte other than those
    reported under "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees" and "Tax Fees", including fees for services related to sales tax
    refunds, consultation on internal cost allocations, consultation on allocation of monies pursuant to an
    administrative proceeding regarding disclosure of brokerage allocation practices in connection with fund sales,
    and analysis of certain portfolio holdings verses investment styles.
</TABLE>

For periods prior to May 6, 2003, the amounts shown above under "Audit-Related
Fees," "Tax Fees" and "All Other Fees" relate to permitted non-audit services
that would have been subject to pre-approval if the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules relating to pre-approval of non-audit services had been in
effect.

ITEM 4(e)(1):
Set forth below are the policies and procedures established by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Trustees relating to the pre-approval of audit and
non-audit related services:

To the extent required by applicable law, pre-approval by the Audit Committee
of the Board is needed for all audit and permissible non-audit services
rendered to the Funds and all permissible non-audit services rendered to MFS or
MFS Related Entities if the services relate directly to the operations and
financial reporting of the Registrant. Pre-approval is currently on an
engagement-by-engagement basis. In the event pre-approval of such services is
necessary between regular meetings of the Audit Committee and it is not
practical to wait to seek pre-approval at the next regular meeting of the Audit
Committee, pre-approval of such services may be referred to the Chair of the
Audit Committee for approval; provided that the Chair may not pre-approve any
individual engagement for such services exceeding $50,000 or multiple
engagements for such services in the aggregate exceeding $100,000 between such
regular meetings of the Audit Committee. Any engagement pre-approved by the
Chair between regular meetings of the Audit Committee shall be presented for
ratification by the entire Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled
meeting.

ITEM 4(e)(2):
None, or 0%, of the services relating to the Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and
All Other Fees paid by the Fund and MFS and MFS Related Entities relating
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant disclosed
above were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(C)
of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (which permits audit committee approval after
the start of the engagement with respect to services other than audit, review
or attest services, if certain conditions are satisfied).

ITEM 4(f):  Not applicable.

ITEM 4(h): The Registrant's Audit Committee has considered whether the
provision by a Registrant's independent registered public accounting firm of
non-audit services to MFS and MFS Related Entities that were not pre-approved
by the Committee (because such services were provided prior to the
effectiveness of SEC rules requiring pre-approval or because such services did
not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the
Registrant) was compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent
registered public accounting firm as the Registrant's principal auditors.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The Registrant has an Audit Committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The members of the Audit
Committee are Messrs. Robert E. Butler, J. Atwood Ives, J. Dale Sherratt and
Robert W. Uek and Mses. Amy B. Lane and Laurie J. Thomsen.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

A schedule of investments of the Registrant is included as part of the report
to shareholders of the Registrant under Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

         The Board of Trustees and the Board of Managers of the investment
companies (the "MFS Funds") advised by Massachusetts Financial Services Company
("MFS") have delegated to MFS the right and obligation to vote proxies for
shares that are owned by the MFS Funds, in accordance with MFS' proxy voting
policies and procedures (the "MFS Proxy Policies"). The MFS Proxy Policies are
set forth below:

                    MASSACHUSETTS FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

    SEPTEMBER 17, 2003, AS REVISED ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2004 AND MARCH 15, 2005

         Massachusetts Financial Services Company, MFS Institutional Advisors,
Inc. and MFS' other investment adviser subsidiaries (collectively, "MFS") have
adopted proxy voting policies and procedures, as set forth below, with respect
to securities owned by the clients for which MFS serves as investment adviser
and has the power to vote proxies, including the registered investment
companies sponsored by MFS, other than the MFS Union Standard Equity Fund (the
"MFS Funds"). References to "clients" in these policies and procedures include
the MFS Funds and other clients of MFS, such as funds organized offshore,
sub-advised funds and separate account clients, to the extent these clients
have delegated to MFS the responsibility to vote proxies on their behalf under
MFS' proxy and voting policies.

                  These policies and procedures include:

                  A. Voting Guidelines;

                  B. Administrative Procedures;

                  C. Monitoring System;

                  D. Records Retention; and

                  E. Reports.

A. VOTING GUIDELINES

1. GENERAL POLICY; POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         MFS' policy is that proxy voting decisions are made in what MFS
believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and not
in the interests of any other party or in MFS' corporate interests, including
interests such as the distribution of MFS Fund shares, administration of 401(k)
plans, and institutional relationships.

         MFS has carefully reviewed matters that in recent years have been
presented for shareholder vote by either management or shareholders of public
companies. Based on the overall principle that all votes cast by MFS on behalf
of its clients must be in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic
interests of such clients, MFS has adopted proxy voting guidelines, set forth
below, that govern how MFS generally plans to vote on specific matters
presented for shareholder vote. In all cases, MFS will exercise its discretion
in voting on these matters in accordance with this overall principle. In other
words, the underlying guidelines are simply that - guidelines. Proxy items of
significance are often considered on a case-by-case basis, in light of all
relevant facts and circumstances, and in certain cases MFS may vote proxies in
a manner different from these guidelines.

         As a general matter, MFS maintains a consistent voting position on
similar proxy proposals with respect to various issuers. In addition, MFS
generally votes consistently on the same matter when securities of an issuer
are held by multiple client accounts. However, MFS recognizes that there are
gradations in certain types of proposals that might result in different voting
positions being taken with respect to different proxy statements. There also
may be situations involving matters presented for shareholder vote that are not
clearly governed by the guidelines, such as proposed mergers and acquisitions.
Some items that otherwise would be acceptable will be voted against the
proponent when it is seeking extremely broad flexibility without offering a
valid explanation. MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines with
respect to a particular shareholder vote when such an override is, in MFS' best
judgment, consistent with the overall principle of voting proxies in the best
long-term economic interests of MFS' clients.

         From time to time, MFS receives comments on these guidelines as well
as regarding particular voting issues from its clients and corporate issuers.
These comments are carefully considered by MFS, when it reviews these
guidelines each year and revises them as appropriate.

         These policies and procedures are intended to address any potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that are
likely to arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS'
clients. If such potential conflicts of interest do arise, MFS will analyze,
document and report on such potential conflicts (see Sections B.2 and E below),
and shall ultimately vote these proxies in what MFS believes to be the best
long-term economic interests of its clients. The MFS Proxy Review Group is
responsible for monitoring and reporting with respect to such potential
conflicts of interest.

2. MFS' POLICY ON SPECIFIC ISSUES

             ELECTION OF DIRECTORS

MFS believes that good governance should be based on a board with a majority of
directors who are "independent" of management, and whose key committees (e.g.
compensation, nominating, and audit committees) are comprised entirely of
"independent" directors. While MFS generally supports the board's nominees in
uncontested elections, we will withhold our vote for a nominee for a board of a
U.S. issuer if, as a result of such nominee being elected to the board, the
board would be comprised of a majority of members who are not "independent" or,
alternatively, the compensation, nominating or audit committees would include
members who are not "independent." MFS will also withhold its vote for a
nominee to the board if he or she failed to attend at least 75% of the board
meetings in the previous year without a valid reason. In addition, MFS will
withhold its vote for all nominees standing for election to a board of a U.S.
issuer: (1) if, since the last annual meeting of shareholders and without
shareholder approval, the board or its compensation committee has repriced
underwater options; or (2) if, within the last year, shareholders approved by
majority vote a resolution recommending that the board rescind a "poison pill"
and the board has failed to take responsive action to that resolution.
Responsive action would include the rescission of the "poison pill"(without a
broad reservation to reinstate the "poison pill" in the event of a hostile
tender offer), or public assurances that the terms of the "poison pill" would
be put to a binding shareholder vote within the next five to seven years.

MFS evaluates a contested election of directors on a case-by-case basis
considering the long-term financial performance of the company relative to its
industry, management's track record, the qualifications of the nominees for
both slates and an evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders.

             CLASSIFIED BOARDS

MFS opposes proposals to classify a board (e.g., a board in which only
one-third of board members are elected each year). MFS supports proposals to
declassify a board.

             NON-SALARY COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

         Restricted stock plans are supposed to reward results rather than
tenure, so the issuance of restricted stock at bargain prices is not favored.
In some cases, restricted stock is granted to the recipient at deep discounts
to fair market value, sometimes at par value. The holder cannot sell for a
period of years, but in the meantime the holder is able to vote and receive
dividends. Eventually the restrictions lapse and the stock can be sold by the
holder.

         MFS votes against stock option programs for officers, employees or
non-employee directors that do not require an investment by the optionee, that
give "free rides" on the stock price, or that permit grants of stock options
with an exercise price below fair market value on the date the options are
granted.

         MFS opposes stock option programs that allow the board or the
compensation committee, without shareholder approval, to reprice underwater
options or to automatically replenish shares (i.e., evergreen plans). MFS will
consider on a case-by-case basis proposals to exchange existing options for
newly issued options (taking into account such factors as whether there is a
reasonable value-for-value exchange).

         MFS opposes stock option and restricted stock plans that provide
unduly generous compensation for officers, directors or employees, or could
result in excessive dilution to other shareholders. As a general guideline, MFS
votes against stock option and restricted stock plans if all such plans for a
particular company involve potential dilution, in the aggregate, of more than
15%. However, MFS may accept a higher percentage (up to 20%) in the case of
startup or small companies which cannot afford to pay large salaries to
executives, or in the case where MFS, based upon the issuer's public
disclosures, believes that the issuer has been responsible with respect to its
recent compensation practices, including the mix of the issuance of restricted
stock and options.

         MFS votes in favor of stock option or restricted stock plans for
non-employee directors as long as they satisfy the requirements set forth above
with respect to stock option and restricted stock plans for company executives.

             EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS

         While we acknowledge that there is no agreement on a uniform
methodology for expensing stock options, MFS supports shareholder proposals to
expense stock options because we believe that the expensing of options presents
a more accurate picture of the company's financial results to investors. We
also believe that companies are likely to be more disciplined when granting
options if the value of stock options were treated as an expense item on the
company's income statements.

             EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

         MFS believes that competitive compensation packages are necessary to
attract, motivate and retain executives. Therefore, MFS opposes shareholder
proposals that seek to set limits on executive compensation. Shareholder
proposals seeking to set limits on executive compensation tend to specify
arbitrary compensation criteria. MFS also opposes shareholder requests for
disclosure on executive compensation beyond regulatory requirements because we
believe that current regulatory requirements for disclosure of executive
compensation are appropriate and that additional disclosure is often
unwarranted and costly. Although we support linking executive stock option
grants to a company's stock performance, MFS opposes shareholder proposals that
mandate a link of performance-based options to a specific industry or peer
group index. MFS believes that compensation committees should retain the
flexibility to propose the appropriate index or other criteria by which
performance-based options should be measured. MFS evaluates other executive
compensation restrictions (e.g., terminating the company's stock option or
restricted stock programs, freezing executive pay during periods of large
layoffs, and establishing a maximum ratio between the highest paid executive
and lowest paid employee) based on whether such proposals are in the best
long-term economic interests of our clients.

             EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS

         MFS supports the use of a broad-based employee stock purchase plans to
increase company stock ownership by employees, provided that shares purchased
under the plan are acquired for no less than 85% of their market value and do
not result in excessive dilution.

             "GOLDEN PARACHUTES"

         From time to time, shareholders of companies have submitted proxy
proposals that would require shareholder approval of severance packages for
executive officers that exceed certain predetermined thresholds. MFS votes in
favor of such shareholder proposals when they would require shareholder
approval of any severance package for an executive officer that exceeds a
certain multiple of such officer's annual compensation that is not determined
in MFS' judgment to be excessive.

             ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES

         In general, MFS votes against any measure that inhibits capital
appreciation in a stock, including proposals that protect management from
action by shareholders. These types of proposals take many forms, ranging from
"poison pills" and "shark repellents" to super-majority requirements.

         MFS will vote for proposals to rescind existing "poison pills" and
proposals that would require shareholder approval to adopt prospective "poison
pills." Nevertheless, MFS will consider supporting the adoption of a
prospective "poison pill" or the continuation of an existing "poison pill" if
the following two conditions are met: (1) the "poison pill" allows MFS clients
to hold an aggregate position of up to 15% of a company's total voting
securities (and of any class of voting securities); and (2) either (a) the
"poison pill" has a term of not longer than five years, provided that MFS will
consider voting in favor of the "poison pill" if the term does not exceed seven
years and the "poison pill" is linked to a business strategy or purpose that
MFS believes is likely to result in greater value for shareholders; or (b) the
terms of the "poison pill" allow MFS clients the opportunity to accept a fairly
structured and attractively priced tender offer (e.g., a "chewable poison pill"
that automatically dissolves in the event of an all cash, all shares tender
offer at a premium price).

         MFS will consider on a case-by-case basis proposals designed to
prevent tenders which are disadvantageous to shareholders such as tenders at
below market prices and tenders for substantially less than all shares of an
issuer.

             REINCORPORATION AND REORGANIZATION PROPOSALS

         When presented with a proposal to reincorporate a company under the
laws of a different state, or to effect some other type of corporate
reorganization, MFS considers the underlying purpose and ultimate effect of
such a proposal in determining whether or not to support such a measure. While
MFS generally votes in favor of management proposals that it believes are in
the best long-term economic interests of its clients, MFS may oppose such a
measure if, for example, the intent or effect would be to create additional
inappropriate impediments to possible acquisitions or takeovers.

             ISSUANCE OF STOCK

         There are many legitimate reasons for issuance of stock. Nevertheless,
as noted above under "Non-Salary Compensation Programs", when a stock option
plan (either individually or when aggregated with other plans of the same
company) would substantially dilute the existing equity (e.g., by approximately
15% or more), MFS generally votes against the plan. In addition, MFS votes
against proposals where management is asking for authorization to issue common
or preferred stock with no reason stated (a "blank check") because the
unexplained authorization could work as a potential anti-takeover device.

             REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

         MFS supports proposals to institute share repurchase plans in which
all shareholders have the opportunity to participate on an equal basis. Such
plans may include a company acquiring its own shares on the open market, or a
company making a tender offer to its own shareholders.

             CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

         MFS votes in favor of proposals to ensure that shareholder voting
results are kept confidential. For example, MFS supports proposals that would
prevent management from having access to shareholder voting information that is
compiled by an independent proxy tabulation firm.

             CUMULATIVE VOTING

         MFS opposes proposals that seek to introduce cumulative voting and for
proposals that seek to eliminate cumulative voting. In either case, MFS will
consider whether cumulative voting is likely to enhance the interests of MFS'
clients as minority shareholders. In our view, shareholders should provide
names of qualified candidates to a company's nominating committee, which now
for the first time (for U.S. listed companies) must be comprised solely of
"independent" directors.

             WRITTEN CONSENT AND SPECIAL MEETINGS

         Because the shareholder right to act by written consent (without
calling a formal meeting of shareholders) can be a powerful tool for
shareholders, MFS generally opposes proposals that would prevent shareholders
from taking action without a formal meeting or would take away a shareholder's
right to call a special meeting of company shareholders.

             INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

         MFS believes that the appointment of auditors is best left to the
board of directors of the company and therefore supports the ratification of
the board's selection of an auditor for the company. Recently, some shareholder
groups have submitted proposals to limit the non-audit activities of a
company's audit firm. Some proposals would prohibit the provision of any
non-audit services by a company's auditors to that company. MFS opposes
proposals recommending the prohibition or limitation of the performance of
non-audit services by an auditor, and proposals recommending the removal of a
company's auditor due to the performance of non-audit work for the company by
its auditor. MFS believes that the board, or its audit committee, should have
the discretion to hire the company's auditor for specific pieces of non-audit
work in the limited situations permitted under current law.

             BEST PRACTICES STANDARDS

         Best practices standards are rapidly developing in the corporate
governance areas as a result of recent corporate scandals, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and revised listing standards on major stock exchanges. MFS
generally support these developments. However, many issuers are not publicly
registered, are not subject to these enhanced listing standards, or are not
operating in an environment that is comparable to that in the United States. In
reviewing proxy proposals under these circumstances, MFS votes for proposals
that enhance standards of corporate governance so long as we believe that -
given the circumstances or the environment within which the issuers operate -
the proposal is consistent with the best long-term economic interests of our
clients.

             FOREIGN ISSUERS - SHARE BLOCKING

         In accordance with local law or business practices, many foreign
companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period
beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the
meeting ("share blocking"). Depending on the country in which a company is
domiciled, the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the
meeting (e.g., one, three or five days) or on a date established by the
company. While practices vary, in many countries the block period can be
continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and
postponed to a later date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to the ability
of a shareholder to have the "block" restriction lifted early (e.g., in some
countries shares generally can be "unblocked" up to two days prior to the
meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be
discretionary with the issuer's transfer agent). Due to these restrictions, MFS
must balance the benefits to its clients of voting proxies against the
potentially serious portfolio management consequences of a reduced flexibility
to sell the underlying shares at the most advantageous time. For companies in
countries with potentially long block periods, the disadvantage of being unable
to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the
advantages of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items. Accordingly,
MFS generally will not vote those proxies in the absence of an unusual,
significant vote. Conversely, for companies domiciled in countries with very
short block periods, MFS generally will continue to cast votes in accordance
with these policies and procedures.

             SOCIAL ISSUES

         There are many groups advocating social change, and many have chosen
the publicly-held corporation as a vehicle for advancing their agenda. Common
among these are resolutions requiring the corporation to refrain from investing
or conducting business in certain countries, to adhere to some list of goals or
principles (e.g., environmental standards) or to promulgate special reports on
various activities. MFS votes against such proposals unless their
shareholder-oriented benefits will outweigh any costs or disruptions to the
business, including those that use corporate resources to further a particular
social objective outside the business of the company or when no discernible
shareholder economic advantage is evident.

         The laws of various states may regulate how the interests of certain
clients subject to those laws (e.g., state pension plans) are voted with
respect to social issues. Thus, it may be necessary to cast ballots differently
for certain clients than MFS might normally do for other clients.


         B. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

         1. MFS PROXY REVIEW GROUP

         The administration of these policies and procedures is overseen by the
MFS Proxy Review Group, which includes senior MFS Legal Department officers and
MFS' Proxy Consultant. The MFS Proxy Review Group:

           a. Reviews these policies and procedures at least annually and
              recommends any amendments considered to be necessary or
              advisable;

           b. Determines whether any material conflicts of interest exist with
              respect to instances in which (i) MFS seeks to override these
              guidelines and (ii) votes not clearly governed by these
              guidelines; and

           c. Considers special proxy issues as they may arise from time to
              time.

         The current MFS Proxy Consultant is an independent proxy consultant
who performs these services exclusively for MFS.

         2. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for monitoring potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that could
arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS' clients. Any
significant attempt to influence MFS' voting on a particular proxy matter
should be reported to the MFS Proxy Review Group. The MFS Proxy Consultant will
assist the MFS Proxy Review Group in carrying out these monitoring
responsibilities.

         In cases where proxies are voted in accordance with these policies and
guidelines, no conflict of interest will be deemed to exist. In cases where (i)
MFS is considering overriding these policies and guidelines, or (ii) matters
presented for vote are not clearly governed by these policies and guidelines,
the MFS Proxy Review Group and the MFS Proxy Consultant will follow these
procedures:

           a. Compare the name of the issuer of such proxy against a list of
              significant current and potential (i) distributors of MFS Fund
              shares, (ii) retirement plans administered by MFS, and (iii) MFS
              institutional clients (the "MFS Significant Client List");

           b. If the name of the issuer does not appear on the MFS Significant
              Client List, then no material conflict of interest will be deemed
              to exist, and the proxy will be voted as otherwise determined by
              the MFS Proxy Review Group;

           c. If the name of the issuer appears on the MFS Significant Client
              List, then at least one member of the MFS Proxy Review Group will
              carefully evaluate the proposed votes in order to ensure that the
              proxy ultimately is voted in what MFS believes to be the best
              long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and not in MFS'
              corporate interests; and

           d. For all potential material conflicts of interest identified under
              clause (c) above, the MFS Proxy Review Group will document: the
              name of the issuer, the issuer's relationship to MFS, the
              analysis of the matters submitted for proxy vote, and the basis
              for the determination that the votes ultimately were cast in what
              MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
              clients, and not in MFS' corporate interests. A copy of the
              foregoing documentation will be provided to the MFS' Conflicts
              Officer.

     The members of the MFS Proxy Review Group other than the Proxy Consultant
     are responsible for creating and maintaining the MFS Significant Client
     List, in consultation with MFS' distribution, retirement plan
     administration and institutional business units. The MFS Significant
     Client List will be reviewed and updated periodically as appropriate.

         3. GATHERING PROXIES

         Most proxies received by MFS and its clients originate at Automatic
Data Processing Corp. ("ADP") although a few proxies are transmitted to
investors by corporate issuers through their custodians or depositories. ADP
and issuers send proxies and related material directly to the record holders of
the shares beneficially owned by MFS' clients, usually to the client's
custodian or, less commonly, to the client itself. This material will include
proxy cards, reflecting the proper shareholdings of Funds and of clients on the
record dates for such shareholder meetings, as well as proxy statements with
the issuer's explanation of the items to be voted upon.

         MFS, on behalf of itself and the Funds, has entered into an agreement
with an independent proxy administration firm, Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. (the "Proxy Administrator"), pursuant to which the Proxy
Administrator performs various proxy vote processing and recordkeeping
functions for MFS' Fund and institutional client accounts. The Proxy
Administrator does not make recommendations to MFS as to how to vote any
particular item. The Proxy Administrator receives proxy statements and proxy
cards directly or indirectly from various custodians, logs these materials into
its database and matches upcoming meetings with MFS Fund and client portfolio
holdings, which are input into the Proxy Administrator's system by an MFS
holdings datafeed. Through the use of the Proxy Administrator system, ballots
and proxy material summaries for the upcoming shareholders' meetings of over
10,000 corporations are available on-line to certain MFS employees, the MFS
Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group.

         4. ANALYZING PROXIES

         After input into the Proxy Administrator system, proxies which are
deemed to be routine and which do not require the exercise of judgment under
these guidelines (e.g., those involving only uncontested elections of directors
and the appointment of auditors)(1) are automatically voted in favor by the
Proxy Administrator without being sent to either the MFS Proxy Consultant or
the MFS Proxy Review Group for further review. All proxies that are reviewed by
either the MFS Proxy Consultant or a portfolio manager or analyst (e.g., those
that involve merger or acquisition proposals) are then forwarded with the
corresponding recommendation to the MFS Proxy Review Group.(2)

- -----------
(1) Proxies for foreign companies often contain significantly more voting items
    than those of U.S. companies. Many of these items on foreign proxies
    involve repetitive, non-controversial matters that are mandated by local
    law. Accordingly, the items that are generally deemed routine and which do
    not require the exercise of judgment under these guidelines (and therefore
    automatically voted in favor) for foreign issuers include the following:
    (i) receiving financial statements or other reports from the board; (ii)
    approval of declarations of dividends; (iii) appointment of shareholders to
    sign board meeting minutes; (iv) discharge of management and supervisory
    boards; (v) approval of share repurchase programs; (vi) election of
    directors in uncontested elections and (vii) appointment of auditors.
(2) From time to time, due to travel schedules and other commitments, an
    appropriate portfolio manager or research analyst is not available to
    provide a recommendation on a merger or acquisition proposal. If such a
    recommendation cannot be obtained within a few business days prior to the
    shareholder meeting, the MFS Proxy Review Group may determine the vote in
    what it believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
    clients.

         Recommendations with respect to voting on non-routine issues are
generally made by the MFS Proxy Consultant in accordance with the policies
summarized under "Voting Guidelines," and other relevant materials. His or her
recommendation as to how each proxy proposal should be voted, including his or
her rationale on significant items, is indicated on copies of proxy cards.
These cards are then forwarded to the MFS Proxy Review Group.

         As a general matter, portfolio managers and investment analysts have
little or no involvement in specific votes taken by MFS. This is designed to
promote consistency in the application of MFS' voting guidelines, to promote
consistency in voting on the same or similar issues (for the same or for
multiple issuers) across all client accounts, and to minimize the potential
that proxy solicitors, issuers, or third parties might attempt to exert
inappropriate influence on the vote. In limited types of votes (e.g., mergers
and acquisitions), the MFS Proxy Consultant or the MFS Proxy Review Group may
consult with or seek recommendations from portfolio managers or analysts. But,
the MFS Proxy Review Group would ultimately determine the manner in which all
proxies are voted.

         As noted above, MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines when
such an override is, in MFS' best judgment, consistent with the overall
principle of voting proxies in the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
clients. Any such override of the guidelines shall be analyzed, documented and
reported in accordance with the procedures set forth in these policies.

         5. VOTING PROXIES

         After the proxy card copies are reviewed, they are voted
electronically through the Proxy Administrator's system. In accordance with its
contract with MFS, the Proxy Administrator also generates a variety of reports
for the MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group, and makes
available on-line various other types of information so that the MFS Proxy
Review Group and the MFS Proxy Consultant may monitor the votes cast by the
Proxy Administrator on behalf of MFS' clients.

         C. MONITORING SYSTEM

         It is the responsibility of the Proxy Administrator and MFS' Proxy
Consultant to monitor the proxy voting process. As noted above, when proxy
materials for clients are received, they are forwarded to the Proxy
Administrator and are input into the Proxy Administrator's system.
Additionally, through an interface with the portfolio holdings database of MFS,
the Proxy Administrator matches a list of all MFS Funds and clients who hold
shares of a company's stock and the number of shares held on the record date
with the Proxy Administrator's listing of any upcoming shareholder's meeting of
that company.

         When the Proxy Administrator's system "tickler" shows that the date of
a shareholders' meeting is approaching, a Proxy Administrator representative
checks that the vote for MFS Funds and clients holding that security has been
recorded in the computer system. If a proxy card has not been received from the
client's custodian, the Proxy Administrator calls the custodian requesting that
the materials be forward immediately. If it is not possible to receive the
proxy card from the custodian in time to be voted at the meeting, MFS may
instruct the custodian to cast the vote in the manner specified and to mail the
proxy directly to the issuer.

         D. RECORDS RETENTION

         MFS will retain copies of these policies and procedures in effect from
time to time and will retain all proxy voting reports submitted to the Board of
Trustees and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds for the period required by
applicable law. Proxy solicitation materials, including electronic versions of
the proxy cards completed by the MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review
Group, together with their respective notes and comments, are maintained in an
electronic format by the Proxy Administrator and are accessible on-line by the
MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group. All proxy voting materials
and supporting documentation, including records generated by the Proxy
Administrator's system as to proxies processed, the dates when proxies were
received and returned, and the votes on each company's proxy issues, are
retained as required by applicable law.

         E. REPORTS

     MFS FUNDS

         Annually, MFS will report the results of its voting to the Board of
Trustees and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds. These reports will include:
(i) a summary of how votes were cast; (ii) a review of situations where MFS did
not vote in accordance with the guidelines and the rationale therefor; (iii) a
review of the procedures used by MFS to identify material conflicts of
interest; and (iv) a review of these policies and the guidelines and, as
necessary or appropriate, any proposed modifications thereto to reflect new
developments in corporate governance and other issues. Based on these reviews,
the Trustees and Managers of the MFS Funds will consider possible modifications
to these policies to the extent necessary or advisable.

         ALL MFS ADVISORY CLIENTS

         At any time, a report can be printed by MFS for each client who has
requested that MFS furnish a record of votes cast. The report specifies the
proxy issues which have been voted for the client during the year and the
position taken with respect to each issue.

         Generally, MFS will not divulge actual voting practices to any party
other than the client or its representatives (unless required by applicable
law) because we consider that information to be confidential and proprietary to
the client.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

GENERAL. Information as of January 23, 2006 regarding the portfolio manager of
the MFS Government Markets Income Trust (the "Fund") is set forth below.

  PORTFOLIO MANAGER     PRIMARY ROLE           SINCE     TITLE AND FIVE YEAR
                                                                HISTORY
Peter C. Vaream          Portfolio Manager     2002    Senior Vice President of
                                                       MFS; employed in the
                                                       investment management
                                                       area of MFS since 1992.

COMPENSATION. As of the Fund's fiscal year ended November 30, 2005, portfolio
manager total cash compensation is a combination of base salary and performance
bonus:

         o Base Salary - Base salary represents a relatively smaller percentage
           of portfolio manager total cash compensation (generally below 33%)
           than incentive compensation.

         o Performance Bonus - Generally, incentive compensation represents a
           majority of portfolio manager total cash compensation. The
           performance bonus is based on a combination of quantitative and
           qualitative factors, with more weight given to the former (generally
           over 60 %) and less weight given to the latter.

             > The quantitative portion is based on pre-tax performance of all
               of the accounts managed by the portfolio manager (which includes
               the Fund and any other accounts managed by the portfolio
               manager) over a one-, three- and five-year period relative to
               the appropriate Lipper peer group universe and/or one or more
               benchmark indices with respect to each account. The primary
               weight is given to portfolio performance over a three-year time
               period with lesser consideration given to portfolio performance
               over one- and five-year periods (adjusted as appropriate if the
               portfolio manager has served for shorter periods).

             > The qualitative portion is based on the results of an annual
               internal peer review process (conducted by other portfolio
               managers, analysts and traders) and management's assessment of
               overall portfolio manager contributions to the investment
               process (distinct from portfolio performance).

Portfolio managers also typically benefit from the opportunity to participate
in the MFS Equity Plan. Equity interests in MFS or its parent company are
awarded by management, on a discretionary basis, taking into account tenure at
MFS, contribution to the investment process and other factors.

Finally, portfolio managers are provided with a benefits package including a
defined contribution plan, health coverage and other insurance, which are
available to other employees of MFS on substantially similar terms. The
percentage of compensation provided by these benefits depends upon the length
of the individual's tenure at MFS and salary level as well as other factors.

Ownership of Fund Shares. The following table shows the dollar range of equity
securities of the Fund beneficially owned by the Fund's portfolio manager as of
the Fund's fiscal year ended November 30, 2005. The following dollar ranges
apply:

         N. None
         A. $1 - $10,000
         B. $10,001 - $50,000
         C. $50,001 - $100,000
         D. $100,001 - $500,000
         E. $500,001 - $1,000,000

Advisory fees are not based upon performance of any of the accounts identified
in the table above.

Potential Conflicts of Interest. MFS seeks to identify potential conflicts of
interest resulting from a portfolio manager's management of both the Fund and
other accounts and has adopted policies and procedures designed to address such
potential conflicts.

In certain instances there may be securities which are suitable for the Fund's
portfolio as well as for accounts with similar investment objectives of the
Adviser or subsidiary of the Adviser. Securities transactions for the Fund and
other accounts with similar investment objectives are generally executed on the
same day, or the next day. Nevertheless, it may develop that a particular
security is bought or sold for only one client even though it might be held by,
or bought or sold for, other clients. Likewise, a particular security may be
bought for one or more clients when one or more other clients are selling that
same security.

When two or more clients are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of
the same security, the securities are allocated among clients in a manner
believed by MFS to be fair and equitable to each. It is recognized that in some
cases this system could have a detrimental effect on the price or volume of the
security as far as the Fund is concerned. In most cases, however, MFS believes
that the Fund's ability to participate in volume transactions will produce
better executions for the Fund.

MFS does not receive a performance fee for its management of the Fund. MFS
and/or a portfolio manager may have an incentive to allocate favorable or
limited opportunity investments or structure the timing of investments to favor
accounts other than the Fund--for instance, those that pay a higher advisory
fee and/or have a performance fee.

Note: The Board of Trustees approves procedures to repurchase shares annually.
The notification to shareholders of the program is part of the semi-annual and
annual reports sent to shareholders. These annual programs begin on March 1st
of each year. The programs conform to the conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the
securities Exchange Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of shares that
may be purchased in each annual period (March 1 through the following February
28) to 10% of the Registrant's outstanding shares as of the first day of the
plan year (March 1). The aggregate number of shares available for purchase for
the March 1, 2005 plan year are 5,326,876.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may send
recommendations to the Board for nominees to the Registrant's Board since the
Registrant last provided disclosure as to such procedures in response to the
requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Based upon their evaluation of the registrant's disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act
    of 1940 (the "Act")) as conducted within 90 days of the filing date of
    this Form N-CSR, the registrant's principal financial officer and
    principal executive officer have concluded that those disclosure controls
    and procedures provide reasonable assurance that the material information
    required to be disclosed by the registrant on this report is recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
    the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.

(b) There were no changes in the registrant's internal controls over financial
    reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the Act) that occurred during
    the second fiscal quarter covered by the report that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
    internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 12. EXHIBITS.

(a) File the exhibits listed below as part of this Form. Letter or number the
    exhibits in the sequence indicated.

    (1) Any code of ethics, or amendment thereto, that is the subject of the
        disclosure required by Item 2, to the extent that the registrant
        intends to satisfy the Item 2 requirements through filing of an
        exhibit: Code of Ethics attached hereto.

    (2) A separate certification for each principal executive officer and
        principal financial officer of the registrant as required by Rule 30a-2
        under the Act (17 CFR 270.30a-2): Attached hereto.

    (3) Any written solicitation to purchase securities under Rule 23c-1 under
        the Act sent or given during the period covered by the report by or on
        behalf of the Registrant to 10 or more persons. Not applicable.

    270.30a-2(b)), Rule 13a-14(b) or Rule 15d-14(b) under the Exchange Act (17
    CFR 240.13a-14(b) or 240.15d-14(b)) and Section 1350 of Chapter 63 of Title
    18 of the United States Code (18 U.S.C. 1350) as an exhibit. A
    certification furnished pursuant to this paragraph will not be deemed
    "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r),
    or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. Such certification

    the registrant specifically incorporates it by reference: Attached hereto.

                                            SEPTEMBER, 2005 AND NOVEMBER, 2005)

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                          PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.       COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (this "Code") has been adopted by the funds
(collectively, "Funds" and each, "Fund") under supervision of the MFS Funds
Board and Compass Board of Trustees/Managers (the "Boards") and applies to the
Funds' Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the
"Covered Officers," each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

         o honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
           or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
           relationships;

         o full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
           reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submits to, the
           Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
           communications made by the Funds;

         o compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules
           and regulations;

         o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
           appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o accountability for adherence to the Code.

II.      CONDUCT GUIDELINES

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer
should not place his or her personal interests ahead of the Funds' interests
and should endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Covered Officer must:

         o not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
           improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
           for any Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to
           the detriment of the Fund; and

         o not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
           individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
           benefit the Fund.

         The following activities, which could create the appearance of a
conflict of interest, are permitted only with the approval of the Funds' Chief
Legal Officer ("CLO"):

         o service as a director on the board of any "for profit" company;

         o running for political office;

         o the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;

         o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
           has current or prospective business dealings unless such
           entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
           as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
           of impropriety;

         o any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
           relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian
           banks, audit firms), other than the Funds' investment adviser,
           principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
           thereof;

         o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
           charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
           transactions or for selling or redeeming shares, other than an
           interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment or securities
           ownership.

III.     DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
           disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;

         o each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
           others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within
           or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors,
           and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
           her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and
           employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting
           full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
           reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
           in other public communications made by the Funds; and

         o it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
           compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the
           standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
           regulations.

IV.      REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
           becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he
           or she has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied
           with the requirements of the Code;

         o annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are
           or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the
           Covered Officer's duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual
           Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;

         o not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or
           employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
           potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this
           Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.

The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
questions are presented under it, granting waivers upon consultation with the
appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will
report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board (or a designee thereof)
promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the
appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.

         The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
         violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the
         appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has occurred,
         it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
         appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
         board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer.

         Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.       OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or
policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their investment adviser or
other service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this
Code.

VI.      AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority
of independent trustees.

VII.     CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be
maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or
this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Funds' Board, its counsel, counsel to the Board's independent
trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Fund's
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII.    INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
