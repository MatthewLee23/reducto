DEAR SHAREHOLDERS:

    It is our pleasure on behalf of the Board of Directors to present the
Semi-Annual Report for The Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for the six
months ended April 30, 2003.

BACKGROUND

    The objective of the Fund is to outperform over the long-term, on a total
return basis (including appreciation and dividends), the Tokyo Stock Price Index
("TOPIX"). Stock selection in Japan is facilitated by the use of a value screen
applied to all stocks listed on the First and Second Sections of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange ("TSE"), the over-the-counter market in Japan and listed on other stock
exchanges in Japan. The way in which the Fund seeks to meet its objective is to
identify under-valued stocks by examining certain fundamental characteristics of
stocks which are listed on the exchanges listed above. These fundamental
characteristics include, among others, the earnings-to-price ratio and the
book-to-price ratio. This method of stock selection results in a master list of
300 stocks (from a universe of 3,300 stocks) from which stocks are selected for
the Fund in accordance with predetermined sector and size parameters.

MARKET REVIEW (NOVEMBER 2002 - APRIL 2003)

    During the six months ended April 30, 2003 the TOPIX declined by -7.62%. The
main points in reviewing the market during this period were as follows:

    - November 02: The Nikkei 225 Index ("Nikkei 225") rebounded by 6.7%,
      recovering to the 9,000 level on November 28, 2002, while the TOPIX closed
      3.5% higher. Early in the month, the market fell, dragged by some major
      banks and debt overhanging companies. However, toward the month end, the
      market regained lost ground because: (1) fears for an immediate
      nationalization of major banks retreated; (2) the U.S. stock market
      remained steady; and (3) foreign investors, who had sold Japanese stocks
      since June 2002, turned into net buyers later in the month.

    - December 02: The Nikkei 225 declined 6.9% to 8,578.95, while the TOPIX
      closed 5.5% lower at 843.29. The Nikkei 225 fell for nine straight days,
      the longest such losing streak in eleven years, while the TOPIX hit an
      18-year low on December 16, 2002. Though there was no specific negative
      news on the fundamentals, profit-taking after a sharp rise in late
      November as well as selling pressure from individual investors dampened
      the market.

    - January 03: The Nikkei 225 declined 2.8% to 8339.94, while the TOPIX
      closed 2.6% lower at 821.18. Early in the month, massive foreign investor
      buying sent the market upward. However, the direction reversed thereafter
      due to: (1) the increase in selling pressure from financial institutions
      and corporate pension funds; and (2) the growing tension regarding a
      military conflict with Iraq, together with the weakness in the U.S. stock
      market.

    - February 03: Geopolitical risks (Iraq and North Korea) and the share
      liquidation by financial institutions forced the market to stay in a
      bottom area after testing the strong resistance of the Nikkei 225, at a
      level of 8800. February and the early part of March is a seasonal weak
      period even in the 1980's bull market years, due to institutional
      liquidation toward the fiscal year end. Geopolitical risks and plummeting
      bank shares made this seasonal weakness even more painful for this period.

    - March 03: The fall in share prices accelerated in March, on the back of
      sales to unwind cross shareholdings in the run-up to the closing of
      full-year accounts. Further, sales related to the return of the government
      portion of employee pension funds, and also the increasing lack of buyers
      due to the uncertainty over the Iraq situation, contributed with the
      market falling to new post-bubble lows. Although there was a rebound in
      share prices across the globe once the war in Iraq began, the upturn in
      Japan was muted due to the financial instability that had been triggered
      by the fall in share prices, as well as concerns over North Korea. During
      March, the average trading volume on the First Section of the TSE was
      830 million shares, with an average trading value of Y570 billion.

    - April 03: April saw investors increasingly focus on low to mid-priced
      stocks as they avoided international blue chips, which were particularly
      affected by the return of the subrogated portion of employee pension funds
      to the government and also the U.S. economy, where the war in Iraq led to
      increasing uncertainty. Buyers continued to shy away, not only because of
      the lacking sense of urgency in government policy, nor the deterioration
      in supply/demand conditions caused by the return of the subrogated portion
      of pension funds, but also because investors took a wait-and-see attitude
      to corporate earnings announcements. As a result, the market remained on a
      downward trend, hitting new post-bubble lows toward the end of the month.
      During April, the average daily trading volume on the First Section of the
      TSE was 950 million shares, with an average trading value of
      Y590 billion.

      Toward the end of the month of April, expectations of government
      intervention to support stock prices declined, after Prime Minister
      Junichiro Koizumi stated his adherence to the path of structural reform,
      leading prices down to a new post-bubble low at one point. However, not
      only did factors that had deteriorated the supply/demand situation, such
      as the return of the government portion of pension funds, come to an end,
      and companies such as Canon and Nissan posted favorable earnings results,
      but there were also rises in U.S. markets. As a result, there were
      buy-backs of international blue chips and high-priced issues. There was
      also the buying of Softbank and other IT-related stocks, and the
      short-term trading in small and mid-cap issues also continued, where there
      were little concerns over supply/ demand. Nevertheless, Sony's
      announcement on April 24, that it projected falling sales and profits for
      fiscal year 2003, shook investor confidence in corporate earnings,
      bringing leading issues down. The market hit new post-bubble lows on
      April 25, 26, and 28. Bank stocks continued to be weak on the back of the
      severe earnings environment.

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

    As shown in Table 1, the net asset value ("NAV") of the Fund decreased by
- -7.49% in USD terms during the six months from November 1, 2002 to April 30,
2003. Over the same period, the benchmark TOPIX lost -5.15 in USD terms.

    Our attribution analysis in JPY base (Table 2) indicates that the
underperformance as much as -2.23% (-9.85% vs. -7.62%) during the period can be
attributed to the negative effects from stock selection (-2.58%). On the other
hand, sector selection showed a positive contribution (0.29%).

STOCK SELECTION

    The attribution analysis indicates that stocks held in Finance (-1.00%) and
Personal Consumption (-0.70%) highly contributed to the negative performance.

SECTOR SELECTION

    The attribution analysis also shows that our underweight stance in Finance
(7.91% vs. 12.44%)(0.60%) and overweight in Machinery (6.06% vs. 3.31%)(0.16%)
had a positive effect on the performance.

BACKGROUND OF NEGATIVE STOCK SELECTION EFFECT

    We would contend that the negative contribution result from stock selection
was brought about by a strong outperformance of small-sized and lower
quality/illiquid stocks, with higher credit-risks that are basically excluded
from our investment universe. Stock prices have recently moved due to
supply/demand reasons, ignoring fundamentals and valuations.

    We believe that the extension of TOPIX passive management by public pensions
and the partial return of the pension management to the government (DAIKO HENJO)
are having a relatively negative impact on large caps and a positive one on
under-held small caps--especially illiquid ones.

    We sense that not just the "daiko henjo" effect but also speculation has
returned to a low quality small-cap universe. The main reason for this in our
view is that at the end of last year the second-tier types of stocks were
trading at low valuations, which is why they are currently rebounding so
strongly.

    We suspect that the outperformance of the "weakest" would stop once they are
again valued in terms of price-earnings-ratio (PER), in line with the broader
market. They have lower liquidity, return-on-equity (RoE), margins, and balance
sheet quality than the average of the market and thus should rationally trade at
a PER discount, in our perspective. While it is hard to predict the exact timing
of the reversing of the current trend, we believe that fundamentals and
valuations should reassert themselves sooner or later.

OUTLOOK & STRATEGY

    The Japanese equity market failed to participate in the global equity market
rally driven by the quick resolution to the war in Iraq and hope for a U.S.
economic recovery. Together with SARS-affected markets such as Hong Kong and
Taiwan, the Japanese market competed for the bottom in April performance.
Underperformance of the Japanese stock market is essentially attributed to the
following two factors:

    (1) Extra selling pressure associated with 'DAIKO HENJO'. Corporate
        liquidation of Japanese shares for daiko henjo is estimated to have
        reached Y1-2 trillion so far this year, which created selling pressure
        on institutional favorites including international blue chips such as
        Toyota and Takeda Chemical. Speculators took advantage of this situation
        by shorting these stocks in the last couple of months.

    (2) Continued weakness of bank shares. Bank financing of Y2 trillion
        including Y1 convertible preferred shares issued by Mizuho in March
        continued to pull down common share prices, as buyers of these Mizuho
        preferred shares, corporations, might have been selling their holdings
        of common shares. The conversion ratio of Mizuho preferred shares should
        be decided by late June. The lower Mizuho share price declines, the more
        shares convertible preferred buyers can get. The outcome of the
        Financial Service Agency ("FSA") special inspection was announced in
        late April, which required additional credit costs of Y1.3 trillion.
        Bank shares continued to plummet in April, reflecting more technical
        factors rather than fundamentals such as a banking crisis.

    Mid and small-cap stocks performed well, while large-cap stocks sank to new
lows due to the fear of DAIKO HENJO liquidation. A reverse two-tier market
persisted so far this year. General market sentiment has not been so bad as the
Nikkei 225 indicated. In April, the TSE Second Section and OTC indices recorded
new highs this year, while the Nikkei 225 sank to a new low. We are seeing the
market of stocks rather than the actual stock market.

    We think the market represented by the Nikkei 225, TOPIX and Morgan Stanley
Capital International (MSCI) Japan Index with strong large-cap influence will
hit a bottom in the current quarter, although we do not have strong conviction
that the market hit the historic bottom (not a bottom) in April, due to lack of
capitulation with huge volume. There are a few reasons to be optimistic:

    (1) Geopolitical risks have been reduced by the relatively quick resolution
        of the war in Iraq. Although the North Korean problem remains
        unresolved, the issue has less significance in the global economic
        outlook with no fear of energy supply. SARS is having an impact on
        regional economies. Although reaction and countermeasures taken by the
        governments, businesses and people might have further negative impact on
        regional economies in the short term, the epidemic will eventually be
        contained.

    (2) DAIKO HENJO liquidation with further potential selling of Y2-3 trillion
        will peak in the current quarter. Stock market support measures such as
        deregulation on corporate share buy-backs and easy use of the share
        purchase organization are now under discussion. Corporations are now
        announcing share buy-back plans, which will be implemented after
        shareholders' meetings in June. Corporations have abundant cash flow.

    (3) With exception of Sony, corporate earnings announcements and guidance by
        major companies were in line or slightly better than expected, although
        bottom line earnings were affected by huge losses from

        mark-to-market evaluation of share holdings. Unless we see a double
        dip in the global economy led by the U.S., positive earnings growth
        for the year ending March 2004 will be achieved. However, the driver of
        profit growth will continue to be cost cutting and restructuring rather
        than top line growth.

    Due to fear of pension fund liquidation, large-cap stocks seem to be
oversold and we have started to see more values in large-cap stocks rather than
mid and small-cap stocks. Thus, we intend to maintain our overweight in
large-cap value stocks with high beta. By sectors, we maintain a rather neutral
stance at this point with modest underweight in defensive sectors such as
pharmaceuticals and utilities and substantial underweight in bank stocks.

FUND PERFORMANCE

    As of April 30, 2003, the Fund's net assets were approximately
$45.5 million, which represents a NAV of $4.20 per share. The return on the
Fund's net assets was -7.49% since the Fund's fiscal year ended on October 31,
2002. Over the same period, the benchmark TOPIX return was -5.15%, as measured
in U.S. Dollars.

    The change in NAV in U.S. Dollars depends on several factors such as:
(1) the percentage change in the benchmark during the period; (2) the over- or
under-performance of the Fund's portfolio, after expenses, relative to the
benchmark; and (3) the change in the Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar exchange rate.

    Our investment strategy is to invest in undervalued securities based on
intensive bottom-up analysis supported by quantitative screening. In our
research efforts, we place a priority on evaluation of the top management, and
its commitment to enhance shareholders' value through clear-cut strategies,
including restructuring, that will be eventually reflected in share prices. We
add value primarily through a bottom-up stock selection approach for the
fundamental Japan equity product.

    It is important to emphasize again that it has not been an objective of the
Fund to predict changes in its benchmark. Rather, its goal is to outperform the
benchmark, while staying fully invested. Specifically, the goal is to hold no

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

    The Japan Equity Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") was incorporated in Maryland on
July 12, 1990 under its former name "The Japan Emerging Equity Fund, Inc." and
commenced operations on July 24, 1992. It is registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission as a closed-end, diversified management investment company.

    The following significant accounting policies are in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for
investment companies. Such policies are consistently followed by the Fund in the
preparation of its financial statements. The preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual reporting results
could differ from those estimates.

    VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS--Securities which are listed on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange or listed on the over-the-counter market in Japan or listed on other
exchanges in Japan and for which market quotations are readily available are
valued at the last reported sales price available to the Fund at the close of
business on the day the securities are being valued or, lacking any such sales,
at the last available bid price. In instances where quotations are not readily
available or where the price as determined by the above procedures is deemed not
to represent fair market value, fair value will be determined in such manner as
the Board of Directors (the "Board") may prescribe. Short-term investments
having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, except where
the Board determines that such valuation does not represent the fair value of
the investment. All other securities and assets are valued at fair value as
determined in good faith by, or under the direction of, the Board.

    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION--The books and records of the Fund are
maintained in U.S. dollars as follows: (1) the foreign currency market value of
investment securities and other assets and liabilities stated in Japanese yen
are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the period; and
(2) purchases, sales, income and expenses are translated at the rate of exchange
prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. The resulting exchange
gains and losses are included in the Statement of Operations. The Fund does not
isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates from the effect of
fluctuations in the market price of securities.

    TAX STATUS--The Fund intends to continue to distribute substantially all of
its taxable income and to comply with the minimum distribution and other
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Accordingly, no provision for federal income or excise taxes is
required.

    The Fund is not subject to any Japanese income, capital gains or other taxes
except for withholding taxes on certain income, generally imposed at rates of
10% on interest and 15% on dividends, paid to the Fund by Japanese corporations.

    INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME--Investment transactions are
recorded on the trade date (the date upon which the order to buy or sell is
executed). Realized and unrealized gains and losses from security and foreign
currency transactions are calculated on the identified cost basis. Dividend
income and corporate

                                       15

THE JAPAN EQUITY FUND, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
actions are recorded generally on the ex-date, except for certain dividends and
corporate actions from Japanese securities which may be recorded after the
ex-date, as soon as the Fund acquires information regarding such dividends or
corporate actions. Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis.

    DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS--The Fund records dividends and
distributions payable to its shareholders on the ex-dividend date. The amount of
dividends and distributions from net investment income and net realized capital
gains are determined in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which
may differ from generally accepted accounting principles. These book basis/tax
basis differences are either considered temporary or permanent in nature. To the
extent these differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified
within the capital accounts based on their federal tax basis treatment;
temporary differences do not require reclassifications. Dividends and
distributions which exceed net investment income and net realized capital gains
for tax purposes are reported as distributions of paid-in-capital.

INVESTMENT MANAGER AND INVESTMENT ADVISER

    The Fund has an Investment Management Agreement with Daiwa SB Investments
(U.S.A.) Ltd. (the "Manager"). Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. ("DSBI" or the
"Adviser"), an affiliate of the Manager, acts as the Fund's investment adviser
pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement between the Manager and DSBI. For
such investment services, the Fund is obligated to pay the Manager a monthly fee
at an annual rate of 0.60% of the first $20 million, 0.40% of the next
$30 million and 0.20% of the excess over $50 million of the Fund's average
weekly net assets, of which fee 60% is paid by the Manager to DSBI.

    Brokerage commissions of $9,422 were paid by the Fund to Daiwa Securities
America, Inc., an affiliate of both the Manager and DSBI, in connection with
portfolio transactions during the six months ended April 30, 2003. In addition,
the Fund has agreed to reimburse the Manager and the Adviser for all
out-of-pocket expenses related to the Fund. For the six months ended April 30,
2003, there were no out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Manager or the
Adviser.

    At April 30, 2003, the Fund owed $18,243 to the Manager and the Manager
informed the Fund that it owed the Adviser $10,946.

ADMINISTRATOR AND CUSTODIAN AND OTHER RELATED PARTIES

    Daiwa Securities Trust Company ("DSTC") an affiliate of the Adviser,
provides certain administrative services to the Fund, for which the Fund pays to
DSTC a monthly fee at an annual rate of 0.20% of the first $60 million of the
Fund's average weekly net assets, 0.15% of the next $40 million and 0.10% of the
excess over $100 million, with a minimum annual fee of $120,000. In addition, as
permitted by the Administration Agreement, the Fund reimburses the Administrator
for its out-of-pocket expenses related to the Fund. For the six months ended
April 30, 2003, there were no out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrator.

    DSTC also acts as custodian for the Fund's assets and has appointed Sumitomo
Mitsui Banking Corporation, formerly The Sumitomo Bank, Limited (the
"Sub-Custodian"), an affiliate of the Manager, to act as the sub-custodian for
all of the cash and securities of the Fund held in Japan. As compensation for
its services as

custodian, DSTC receives a monthly fee and reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses. Such expenses include fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the
Sub-Custodian. During the six months ended April 30, 2003, DSTC and the
Sub-Custodian earned $13,584 and $25,625, respectively, as compensation for
custodial service to the Fund.

    At April 30, 2003, the Fund owed $10,000 and $2,016 to DSTC for
administration and custodian fees, respectively, excluding fees and expenses of
$2,747 payable to the Sub-Custodian.

    During the six months ended April 30, 2003, the Fund paid or accrued $26,281
for legal services in connection with the Fund's on-going operations to a law
firm of which the Fund's Assistant Secretary is a partner.

INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES AND FEDERAL INCOME TAX MATTERS

    For federal income tax purposes, the cost of securities owned at April 30,
2003 was substantially the same as the cost of securities for financial
statement purposes. At April 30, 2003, the net unrealized depreciation of
investments for federal income tax purposes, excluding short-term securities, of
$13,826,569 was composed of gross appreciation of $739,523 for those investments
having an excess of value over cost, and gross depreciation of $14,566,092 for
those investments having an excess of cost over value. For the six months ended
April 30, 2003, total aggregate purchases and sales of portfolio securities,
excluding short-term securities, were $17,627,374 and $17,305,156, respectively.

    At October 31, 2002, the Fund had a remaining capital loss carryover of
$42,874,512, of which $6,264,639 expires in the year 2005, $16,909,841 expires
in the year 2006, $6,225,150 expires in the year 2009 and $13,474,882 expires in
the year 2010 available to offset future net capital gains.
