DEAR FUND SHAREHOLDER,

We are pleased to provide you with the unaudited financial statements of The
India Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for the six months ended June 30, 2005.

The Fund's net asset value ("NAV") closed at $30.20 on June 30, 2005,
representing an increase of 6.11% from the Fund's NAV of $28.47 on December 31,
2004. The Fund underperformed its benchmark, the IFC Investable Index, which
gained 7.9% during the same period.*

The Indian stock market finished the first six months of 2005 as one of the best
performing markets in Asia. Highlights of the first half of the year included
the annual budget announcement by the government, which included an adjustment
to the personal tax rate that we believe will help sustain domestic consumption.
In addition, the increased infrastructure allocation underscores the
government's commitment to improving the country's infrastructure in an effort
to speed economic growth. Finally, the government also reiterated its focus on
maintaining price stability by forcing a freeze on fuel prices. The rise in
inflation has cooled to approximately 5.5%. Robust foreign institutional inflows
of over $4.5 billion for the first six months of 2005 and a record number of
foreign institutional investor registrations in the first six months of 2005
also contributed to the market's strength in the first six months of 2005.

Looking ahead, we believe that India will benefit from favorable conditions such
as high consumer confidence, favorable liquidity and strong economic
fundamentals as demonstrated by gross domestic product growth of 7% in the
quarter ended March 31, 2005. These factors, in addition to a growing middle
class, should continue to support domestic consumption.


                                                                               1

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Finally, as the Indian stock market continues to set new all-time highs, we
believe valuations may not be as compelling as they were during the past year.
Nevertheless, we strongly believe that the fundamental long-term outlook for
India remains positive.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we thank you for your participation and
continued support of the Fund. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate
to call our toll-free number, 800-421-4777.

Sincerely,

/s/ Bryan McKigney

Bryan McKigney
Chairman, President and Director

FUNDAMENTAL PERIODIC REPURCHASE POLICY

The Fund  has  adopted  the  following  fundamental  policy  regarding  periodic
repurchases:

   a) The Fund  will  make  offers  to  repurchase  its  shares  at  semi-annual
      intervals pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
      as amended from time to time ("Offers").  The Board of Directors may place
      such  conditions and  limitations on Offers as may be permitted under Rule
      23c-3.
   b) 14 days  prior to the last  Friday of the  Fund's  first and third  fiscal
      quarters,  or the next  business day if such Friday is not a business day,
      will be the deadline (the "Repurchase Request Deadline") by which the Fund
      must receive repurchase  requests submitted by stockholders in response to
      the most recent Offer.
   c) The date on which the repurchase price for shares is to be determined (the
      "Repurchase  Pricing  Date")  shall occur no later than the last Friday of
      the Fund's first and third fiscal  quarters,  or the next  business day if
      such day is not a business day.
   d) Offers may be suspended  or  postponed  under  certain  circumstances,  as
      provided for in Rule 23c-3.

Notes to Financial Statements                                        (UNAUDITED)


NOTE A: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The India Fund,  Inc. (the "Fund") was  incorporated in Maryland on December 27,
1993, and commenced operations on February 23, 1994. The Fund operates through a
branch in the Republic of Mauritius. The Fund is registered under the Investment
Company  Act  of  1940,   as  amended  (the  "1940  Act"),   as  a   closed-end,
non-diversified  management  investment company. The Fund's investment objective
is  long-term  capital  appreciation  by investing  primarily  in Indian  equity
securities.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires  management
to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS:

PORTFOLIO  VALUATION.  Investments  are  stated  at  value  in the  accompanying
financial  statements.  All securities  for which market  quotations are readily
available are valued at:

     (i)   the last sales price prior to the time of determination, if there was
           a sale on the date of determination,

     (ii)  at the mean between the last current bid and asked  prices,  if there
           was no sales  price on such  date and bid and  asked  quotations  are
           available, and

     (iii) at the bid  price if there  was no sales  price on such date and only
           bid quotations are available.

Securities  that  are  traded  over-the-counter  are  valued,  if bid and  asked
quotations are available,  at the mean between the current bid and asked prices.
Securities for which sales prices and bid and asked quotations are not available
on the date of determination may be valued at the most recently available prices
or quotations under policies  adopted by the Board of Directors.  Investments in
short-term  debt  securities  having a maturity of 60 days or less are valued at
amortized  cost which  approximates  market value.  Securities  for which market
values are not readily  ascertainable are carried at fair value as determined in
good faith by or under the supervision of the Board of Directors.  The net asset
value per share of the Fund is calculated weekly and at the end of each month.

INVESTMENT  TRANSACTIONS  AND INVESTMENT  INCOME.  Investment  transactions  are
accounted for on the trade date. The cost of  investments  sold is determined by
use of the  specific  identification  method for both  financial  reporting  and
income tax reporting purposes. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis;
dividend  income  is  recorded  on the  ex-dividend  date or,  using  reasonable
diligence,  when known.  The  collectibility  of income  receivable  from Indian
securities  is  evaluated   periodically,   and  any  resulting  allowances  for
uncollectible amounts are reflected currently in the determination of investment
income.


                                                                              15

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2005
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)                            (UNAUDITED)

TAX STATUS.  No provision is made for U.S.  federal income or excise taxes as it
is the Fund's intention to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company
and to  make  the  requisite  distributions  to its  shareholders  that  will be
sufficient to relieve it from all or substantially all federal income and excise
taxes.

Income and capital gain  distributions are determined in accordance with federal
income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.

FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSLATION.  The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S.  dollars.  Foreign  currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on
the following basis:

     (i)   value  of  investment  securities,  assets  and  liabilities  at  the
           prevailing rates of exchange on the valuation date; and

     (ii)  purchases and sales of investment securities and investment income at
           the relevant rates of exchange  prevailing on the respective dates of
           such transactions.

The Fund  generally  does not  isolate  the  effect of  fluctuations  in foreign
exchange  rates  from  the  effect  of  fluctuations  in the  market  prices  of
securities. However, the Fund does isolate the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency  rates  when  determining  the gain or loss  upon  the sale of  foreign
currency  denominated  debt  obligations  pursuant  to U.S.  federal  income tax
regulations;  such amounts are  categorized as foreign  currency gains or losses
for federal  income tax  purposes.  The Fund reports  certain  realized  foreign
exchange  gains and  losses as  components  of  realized  gains and  losses  for
financial  reporting  purposes,  whereas  such  amounts  are treated as ordinary
income for federal income tax reporting purposes.

Securities  denominated  in  currencies  other than U.S.  dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Foreign security
and  currency  transactions  may involve  certain  considerations  and risks not
typically  associated  with those of domestic origin as a result of, among other
factors,  the  level of  governmental  supervision  and  regulation  of  foreign
securities markets and the possibility of political or economic instability, and
the fact that foreign  securities markets may be smaller and have less developed
and less reliable settlement and share registration procedures.

DISTRIBUTION  OF INCOME AND GAINS.  The Fund intends to  distribute  annually to
shareholders  substantially all of its net investment income,  including foreign
currency  gains,  and to  distribute  annually any net realized  gains after the
utilization of available capital loss carryovers. An additional distribution may
be made to the extent necessary to avoid payment of a 4% federal excise tax.

Distributions to shareholders  are recorded on the ex-dividend  date. The amount
of dividends and distributions from net investment income and net realized gains
are determined in accordance with

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2005

federal  income tax  regulations,  which may differ from  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. These "book/tax" differences
are either  considered  temporary or  permanent  in nature.  To the extent these
differences are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified at the end of
each fiscal  year with the capital  accounts  based on their  federal  tax-basis
treatment; temporary differences do not require reclassification.  Dividends and
distributions  which exceed net investment income and net realized capital gains
for  financial  reporting  purposes  but not for tax  purposes  are  reported as
dividends in excess of net investment  income and net realized capital gains. To
the extent  they exceed net  investment  income and net  realized  gains for tax
purposes, they are reported as distributions of additional paid-in capital.

NOTE D: FOREIGN INCOME TAX

The Fund  conducts  its  investment  activities  in India as a tax  resident  of
Mauritius  and  expects  to obtain  benefits  under the double  taxation  treaty
between  Mauritius and India (the "tax treaty" or "treaty").  To obtain benefits
under the tax treaty, the Fund must meet certain tests and conditions, including
the establishment of Mauritius tax residence and related requirements.  The Fund
has obtained a certificate from the Mauritian  authorities that it is a resident
of Mauritius  under the tax treaty  between  Mauritius and India.  Under current
regulations,  a fund which is a tax resident in Mauritius under the treaty,  but
has no branch  or  permanent  establishment  in India,  will not be  subject  to
capital gains tax in India on the sale of securities or to tax on dividends paid
by Indian companies.  The Fund is subject to and accrues Indian  withholding tax
on interest earned on Indian securities at the rate of 20.91%.

The  Fund  will,  in any year  that it has  taxable  income  for  Mauritius  tax
purposes,  elect to pay tax on its net income for  Mauritius tax purposes at any
rate between 0% and 35%.

The Fund  continues  to:  (i)  comply  with the  requirements  of the tax treaty
between  India and  Mauritius;  (ii) be a tax resident of  Mauritius;  and (iii)
maintain  that its central  management  and control  resides in  Mauritius,  and
therefore  management believes that the Fund will be able to obtain the benefits
of the tax treaty  between India and  Mauritius.  Accordingly,  no provision for
Indian income taxes has been made in  accompanying  financial  statements of the

NOTE E: QUARTERLY REPURCHASE OFFERS

In  February  2003,  the Board of  Directors  approved,  subject to  stockholder
approval,  a fundamental  policy whereby the Fund would adopt an "interval fund"
structure  pursuant to Rule 23c-3 under the 1940 Act.  Stockholders  of the Fund
approved  the policy on April 30,  2003.  As an  interval  fund,  the Fund makes
semi-annual  repurchase  offers at net asset value (less a 2% repurchase fee) to
all Fund  stockholders.  The percentage of outstanding  shares that the Fund can
repurchase in each offer is established by the Fund's Board of Directors shortly
before the commencement of each  semi-annual  offer and is between 5% and 25% of
the Fund's then-outstanding shares.

During  the six months  ended  June 30,  2005,  the  results of the  semi-annual
repurchase offer were as follows:

                                                                   JUNE 30, 2005
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)                            (UNAUDITED)

NOTE F: RIGHTS OFFER

On  December  17,  2004,  the Fund  commenced  a rights  offering  and issued to
stockholders  as of December  17, 2004 one right for each share of common  stock
held. The rights were not transferable and, consequently, were not listed on any
exchange. The rights entitled holders to subscribe for an aggregate of 7,546,991
shares of the  Fund's  common  stock.  In  addition,  the Fund had the option of
issuing  additional  shares  in an  amount  up to 25% of the  shares  that  were
available in the primary offering,  or 1,886,747 shares,  for an aggregate total
of  9,433,738  shares.  The offer  expired on January  31,  2005.  The Fund sold
9,433,738 shares at the subscription price per share of $26.50 (representing 95%
of the Fund's net asset  value per share on the  expiration  date of the offer).
The  total  proceeds  of the  rights  offering  were  $249,994,057  and the Fund
incurred costs to date of $572,549.

NOTE G: CONCENTRATION OF RISKS

At June 30, 2005,  substantially  all of the Fund's net assets were  invested in
Indian  securities.  The  Indian  securities  markets  are  among  other  things
substantially  smaller, less developed,  less liquid, subject to less regulation
and  more  volatile  than  the   securities   markets  in  the  United   States.
Consequently,  and as further discussed above,  acquisitions and dispositions of
securities by the Fund involve special risks and considerations not present with
respect to U.S.  securities.  At June 30, 2005, the Fund has a concentration  of
its investment in computer,  finance, and diversified industries.  The values of
such investments may be affected by changes in such industry sectors.

Securities  denominated  in  currencies  other than U.S.  dollars are subject to
changes in value due to fluctuations in foreign  exchange.  Foreign security and
currency  transactions  involve certain  considerations  and risks not typically
associated  with those of domestic  origin as a result of, among other  factors,
the level of  governmental  supervision  and  regulation  of foreign  securities
markets and the  possibilities  of political or economic  instability,  the fact
that foreign securities markets may be smaller and less developed,  and the fact
that securities,  tax and corporate laws may have only recently developed or are
in developing  stages,  and laws may not exist to cover all  contingencies or to
protect investors adequately.

In the normal course of business, the Fund may enter into contracts that contain
a variety of  representations  and  warranties and which may provide for general
indemnifications.  The Fund's  maximum  exposure  under  these  arrangements  is
unknown,  as this would involve  future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, management expects the
risk of loss to be remote.


                                                                              21

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Continuation of the Management Agreements

The Investment  Company Act of 1940, as amended,  requires that the Fund's Board
of Directors,  including a majority of its Directors who are not affiliated with
the Fund's investment  adviser (the "Independent  Directors") voting separately,
approve the Fund's  advisory  agreements  and the related fees for their initial
terms and on an annual basis  thereafter at a meeting  called for the purpose of
voting on the agreements' approval or continuation.  At a meeting held in person
on May 17,  2005,  the Board  discussed  both the Fund's  Amended  and  Restated
Management  Agreement  (the  "Management  Agreement"),  dated February 25, 2005,
between  the Fund and  Advantage  Advisers,  Inc.  ("Advantage")  as well as the
Country Advisory Agreement (the "Country Advisory  Agreement," and together with
the Management  Agreement,  the  "Agreements"),  dated October 26, 2004, between
Advantage and Imperial Investment Advisors Private Limited ("Imperial").  At the
meeting, the Board, including the Independent  Directors,  unanimously agreed to
renew each of the Agreements for a six-month term, or through  December 4, 2005.
In  making  this  decision,   the  Independent  Directors  were  represented  by
independent counsel who assisted them in their deliberations prior to and during
the Board meeting and in the meeting's executive session.

In  considering  whether to  continue  the Fund's  Agreements,  the  Independent
Directors  had  undertaken  certain  actions  in  order to  gather  information,
including  the  formation  of  a  joint  committee  of  the  Boards  of  various
Oppenheimer & Co.  ("Oppenheimer")  funds and participation in joint meetings of
various  Oppenheimer  funds to identify issues and discuss  developments  and to
provide Oppenheimer with an opportunity to respond to the Boards' inquiries.  In
addition, during the past several months the joint committee and the Independent
Directors  conducted  interviews of certain key personnel of Oppenheimer and the
Fund's service providers,  including the Fund's portfolio manager,  during which
the Independent Directors discussed, among other things, the portfolio manager's
employment   arrangements  with  Oppenheimer.   The  Independent  Director  also
previously  raised a number of issues  with the  Chairman  of  Oppenheimer,  the
ultimate parent of Advantage and Imperial, including certain matters relating to
the Fund and  Oppenheimer's  business  strategy  with  respect to the Fund,  all
matters to which the Chairman of Oppenheimer responded.

In addition, the Board reviewed materials provided by Advantage, which included,
among other things, Oppenheimer's business, personnel and operations,  services,
compensation  by the  Fund and  compliance  activities,  as well as  information
regarding the Fund's  investment  performance  and expenses  compared to another
fund with  investment  objectives and policies  similar to those of the Fund, as
well as compared to the benchmark index and an analysis of the  profitability of
the investment  advisory  relationship  to Advantage and Imperial.  Fund counsel
also  provided  a  memorandum  outlining  the  legal  duties of the  Board,  and
information regarding compliance matters relating to Advantage and Imperial were
also provided to the Board by Advantage.

The Board  considered  factors  relating to both the  selection of Advantage and
Imperial  and the  approval  of the  fees  when  reviewing  the  Agreements.  In
particular, the Board considered the following:

                                                            THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Continuation of the Management Agreements (continued)

(i) The qualifications of Advantage and Imperial,  including the nature,  extent
and quality of services to be provided  and the  investment  performance  of the
Fund,  Advantage and Imperial:  First, the Directors  reviewed the services that
Advantage  provides  to the Fund,  including,  but not  limited  to,  making the
day-to-day  decisions for  investing  the Fund's  assets in accordance  with the
Fund's  objectives  and policies  and  investment  restrictions,  subject to the
supervision and direction of the Board.  The Directors also listened to a report
by  the  portfolio  manager  detailing  (i)  information  regarding  Advantage's
management of the Fund's portfolio;  (ii) the Fund's  performance;  and (iii) an
analysis of the advisory fees paid by the Fund. The Chairman of the Fund and the
portfolio manager discussed the Fund's  performance (on an absolute and relative
basis),  the expenses  borne by the Fund, the nature and quality of the advisory
and  administrative  services rendered to the Fund by Advantage and Imperial and
certain  expenses  borne by Advantage in its management of the Fund and compared
the advisory  fees paid by the Fund to those paid by the Fund's  principal  peer
fund. The Board also  considered  the fact that  Advantage also makes  available
research and  statistical  data to the Fund, as well as monitors the performance
of the Fund's outside  service  providers,  including the Fund's  administrator,
transfer agent and custodian.  The Directors also reviewed the services Imperial
provides  to the Fund,  including,  but not limited  to,  furnishing  advice and
making   recommendations  to  Advantage  regarding  the  purchase  and  sale  of
securities and also providing research and statistical data to Advantage.

In addition,  the Directors considered the education,  background and experience
of the  personnel  and  management  teams  at  Advantage  and  Imperial,  and in
particular,  the track record of the portfolio manager. Among other things, they
took into  consideration  the favorable history of the portfolio manager for the
Fund,  finding that this has had, and would likely continue to have, a favorable
impact on the success of the Fund. The Directors also considered Advantage's and
Imperial's  employee  turnover,  compensation  and  budget  structure  and their
ability to attract and retain quality and experienced personnel. They considered
the quality of the support  provided by  Oppenheimer  and its  affiliates to the
Fund. The Directors also considered both  Advantage's and Imperial's  investment
philosophy with respect to the Fund and the investment outlook for the Fund. The
Directors  concluded  that they were  satisfied  with the services that had been
provided to the Fund by Advantage and Imperial.

(ii) The  reasonableness  of the advisory fees: The Directors  reviewed the past
investment  performance of the Fund, Advantage and Imperial, as well as the past
investment  performance  of  the  Fund's  principal  peer.  In  particular,  the
Directors  focused on the analysis of the Fund's  performance  in the  materials
provided by Advantage,  noting that the Fund's  performance  was comparable with
that of its principal  peer fund, and that the Fund  outperformed  its benchmark
over the last three years and since inception for both annualized and cumulative
returns. Further, the Fund's performance was strong over all periods in absolute
terms.  The Directors  recognized  that past  performance is not an indicator of
future performance,  but concluded that Advantage and Imperial had the necessary
expertise  to  continue  to manage the Fund in  accordance  with its  investment
objectives and strategies.


                                                                              23

THE INDIA FUND, INC.


Continuation of the Management Agreements (continued)

The Directors next  considered  the costs of the services  provided by Advantage
and  Imperial.  As  part of  their  analysis,  the  Directors  gave  substantial
consideration  to the  comparisons  of fees and  expense  ratios  of the Fund as
described  in  the  materials  provided  by  Advantage.   Under  the  Management
Agreement,  the Fund pays to Advantage a monthly fee computed at the annual rate
of:  (i) 1.10% of the  Fund's  average  weekly  net  assets up to and  including
$600,000,000 and (ii) 0.95% of the Fund's average weekly net assets in excess of
$600,000,000. Under the Country Advisory Agreement, Advantage pays to Imperial a
monthly  fee equal to an annual rate of 0.10% of the Fund's  average  weekly net
assets.

In reviewing the investment  advisory fees, the Directors  noted that the Fund's
fee was  commensurate  with that of its principal peer fund. The Directors noted
that the Fund's  expense  ratio was slightly  higher than that of its peer fund.
The Directors  also  considered  the other  benefits to Advantage,  Imperial and
their affiliates from the relationship with the Fund,  including,  among others,
the administration fees paid to Oppenheimer.  Further,  the Directors considered
the extent to which  economies  of scale would be realized as the Fund grows and
whether the fee levels reflect  economies of scale for the benefit of the Fund's
shareholders,  noting  that  in  connection  with  the  Fund's  rights  offering
completed  in  February,  the  advisory  fee had been revised to include a break
point which the Directors believe appropriately reflects applicable economies of
scale.

(iii) The operating  expenses of the Fund: The Directors  reviewed the operating
expenses  of the Fund,  on an  absolute  basis and as  compared  to those of its
principal  peer fund.  The  Directors  noted that, as described in the materials
provided by Advantage,  the annualized  expense ratio had slightly  decreased in
2004 as compared to 2003. The Directors also reviewed  payments made by the Fund
to its affiliates,  including  Oppenheimer,  for various services. The Directors
concluded that the expenses of the Fund were reasonable.

(iv) Portfolio transactions: The Directors considered the policies and practices
of the Fund,  Advantage and Imperial in effecting  portfolio  transactions.  The
Directors  considered  the Fund's  general  policies with respect to brokerages,
including  payment  levels,  allocation  policies  among clients and use of soft
dollars,  as described in the  materials  provided by  Advantage,  and discussed
whether the  transactions  were carried out  competently and within the scope of
applicable  governmental  and  Fund  policy  limitations.   The  Directors  also
considered the Fund's  transactions with affiliates,  portfolio  turnover rates,
the  recapture  of  brokerage  commissions  and the  consideration  of  research
services  in  placing   portfolio   transactions.   The   Directors   took  into
consideration  other benefits to be derived by Advantage in connection  with the
Management  Agreement,  noting  particularly the research and related  services,
within the meaning of Section 28(e) of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended,  that  Advantage  would be eligible to receive by allocating the Fund's
brokerage transactions.

(v) Advantage's and Imperial's  management of other funds and other  investments
and  fees  paid:  The  Directors  also  considered  Advantage's  and  Imperial's
management  of other funds and other  investment  products  and the fees paid in
those instances, noting that Advantage managed one other registered

Continuation of the Management Agreements (continued)

fund which invested in Asia. The Directors  compared both the services  rendered
and the fees paid  under the  agreement  to the other  fund,  and the  Directors
determined  that the services and fees were  comparable  to those being  offered
under the other contract by Advantage. The Directors noted that Imperial did not
manage any other similar funds or accounts,  and  accordingly,  a comparison was
not in that case possible.

(vi) The profitability of Advantage,  Imperial and their affiliates with respect
to their relationship to the Fund: The Directors reviewed information  regarding
the  profitability  to Advantage of its  relationship  with the Fund.  The Board
considered  the level of  Advantage's  and  Imperial's  profits  and whether the
profits were reasonable for Advantage and Imperial.  The profitability  analysis
took into  consideration  fall out  benefits  from  Advantage's  and  Imperial's
relationship with the Fund,  including fees paid to Advantage and Imperial under
the Agreements and under the Administration  Agreement. The Directors found that
the profits realized by Advantage and Imperial from their  relationship with the
Fund were reasonable and consistent with fiduciary duties.

The  Board  also  considered   possible   alternatives  to  the  management  and
sub-advisory  arrangements from the standpoint of the Fund and its shareholders.
The Directors  considered the relative advantages and disadvantages of retaining
another  investment  adviser (or  advisers)  or hiring  internal  management  to
perform all or a part of the advisory,  administrative or operational tasks that
Advantage,   Imperial  and  Oppenheimer   provide.   In  connection  with  their
examination of these alternatives,  the Directors  considered all of the factors
described above. The Directors  further  considered  whether the Fund would have
the  ability  on its own to  attract,  retain  and  supervise  highly  qualified
personnel and obtain services at least equivalent to those provided by Advantage
and Imperial under the Agreements.

In considering whether to approve the continuation of the Agreements,  the Board
did not identify nor was any single factor  determinative to the decision of the
Board. The Board also separately considered the operational,  administrative and
other  services  provided to the Fund by  Oppenheimer  under the  Administration
Agreement  between  the Fund and  Oppenheimer.  The  Independent  Directors  are
satisfied with the services  currently provided by Advantage and Imperial to the
Fund  and  with  the  investment   performance  and  reasonable  expense  levels
(including  advisory fees) of the Fund as well as the general  responsiveness of
Oppenheimer  to the issues  raised.  On that basis,  the  Independent  Directors
believe that the  continuation of the Agreements is in the best interests of the
Fund and its shareholders. As the Independent Directors' primary interest is the
long-term  stability  of the Fund and in  light  of the  fact  that  there is no
employment  contract in place with the Fund's portfolio  manager,  the Directors
determined  that it would be  appropriate  to continue the  Agreements for a six
month period during which time Oppenheimer would endeavor to reach  satisfactory
employment or other  arrangements for the long-term stable portfolio  management
of  the  Fund.  The  Independent   Directors  also  determined  to  establish  a
subcommittee to explore alternatives for the management of the Fund in the event
that  Oppenheimer  is not able to satisfy the Board as to its long term business
plan.  At a  subsequent  meeting,  although  no formal  action  was taken by the
Independent Directors,  the Independent Directors considered proposals from four
firms, including Oppenheimer, for the management of the Fund.

                                                            THE INDIA FUND, INC.

Dividends and Distributions


DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund intends to distribute annually to shareholders substantially all of its
net investment income, and to distribute any net realized capital gains at least
annually.  Net  investment  income  for this  purpose  is income  other than net
realized long and short-term capital gains net of expenses.

Pursuant to the  Dividend  Reinvestment  and Cash  Purchase  Plan (the  "Plan"),
shareholders whose shares of Common Stock are registered in their own names will
be deemed to have elected to have all distributions  automatically reinvested by
the Plan Agent in Fund  shares  pursuant to the Plan,  unless such  shareholders
elect to  receive  distributions  in cash.  Shareholders  who  elect to  receive
distributions  in cash will receive all  distributions  in cash paid by check in
dollars mailed  directly to the shareholder by the dividend paying agent. In the
case of  shareholders  such as banks,  brokers or nominees  that hold shares for
others who are beneficial owners, the Plan Agent will administer the Plan on the
basis of the number of shares certified from time to time by the shareholders as
representing the total amount  registered in such  shareholders'  names and held
for  the  account  of  beneficial  owners  that  have  not  elected  to  receive
distributions  in cash.  Investors  that own shares  registered in the name of a
bank,   broker  or  other  nominee  should  consult  with  such  nominee  as  to
participation  in the Plan  through  such  nominee,  and may be required to have
their shares registered in their own names in order to participate in the Plan.

The Plan Agent serves as agent for the shareholders in  administering  the Plan.
If the  directors  of the Fund  declare an income  dividend  or a capital  gains
distribution   payable   either  in  the  Fund's   Common   Stock  or  in  cash,
nonparticipants  in the Plan will receive cash and participants in the Plan will
receive Common Stock, to be issued by the Fund or purchased by the Plan Agent in
the open  market,  as  provided  below.  If the  market  price  per share on the
valuation  date equals or exceeds  net asset  value per share on that date,  the
Fund  will  issue new  shares to  participants  at net  asset  value;  provided,
however,  that if the net asset  value is less than 95% of the  market  price on
valuation date, then such shares will be issued at 95% of the market price.  The
valuation  date will be the  dividend or  distribution  payment date or, if that
date is not a New York Stock Exchange  trading day, the next  preceding  trading
day. If net asset value exceeds the market price of Fund shares at such time, or
if the Fund  should  declare an income  dividend or capital  gains  distribution
payable only in cash,  the Plan Agent will, as agent for the  participants,  buy
Fund shares in the open market, on the New York Stock Exchange or elsewhere, for
the  participants'  accounts on, or shortly after,  the payment date. If, before
the Plan Agent has  completed  its  purchases,  the market price exceeds the net
asset value of a Fund share,  the average per share  purchase  price paid by the
Plan Agent may exceed the net asset value of the Fund's shares, resulting in the
acquisition  of fewer  shares than if the  distribution  had been paid in shares
issued by the Fund on the dividend payment date.


                                                                              27

Dividends and Distributions (continued)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

Because of the forgoing  difficulty with respect to open market  purchases,  the
Plan  provides  that if the Plan  Agent is unable to  invest  the full  dividend
amount in  open-market  purchases  during the  purchase  period or if the market
discount shifts to a market premium during the purchase  period,  the Plan Agent
will cease  making  open-market  purchases  and  shareholders  will  receive the
uninvested portion of the dividend amount in newly issued shares at the close of
business on the last purchase date.

Participants  have the option of making  additional  cash  payments  to the Plan
Agent, annually, in any amount from $100 to $3,000, for investment in the Fund's
Common Stock. The Plan Agent will use all such funds received from  participants
to purchase Fund shares in the open market on or about February 15.

Any voluntary cash payment received more than 30 days prior to this date will be
returned by the Plan Agent, and interest will not be paid on any uninvested cash
payment. To avoid unnecessary cash  accumulations,  and also to allow ample time
for receipt and processing by the Plan Agent, it is suggested that  participants
send in voluntary  cash payments to be received by the Plan Agent  approximately
ten days before an applicable  purchase date specified  above. A participant may
withdraw a voluntary cash payment by written  notice,  if the notice is received
by the Plan Agent not less than 48 hours before such payment is to be invested.

The Plan Agent  maintains  all  shareholder  accounts in the Plan and  furnishes
written  confirmations of all transactions in an account,  including information
needed by  shareholders  for personal and tax records.  Shares in the account of
each  Plan  participant  will be  held  by the  Plan  Agent  in the  name of the
participant,  and each  shareholder's  proxy will include those shares purchased
pursuant to the Plan.

There is no charge to participants  for  reinvesting  dividends or capital gains
distributions  or  voluntary  cash  payments.  The  Plan  Agent's  fees  for the
reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions  and voluntary  cash
payments  will be paid by the Fund.  There  will be no  brokerage  charges  with
respect  to  shares  issued  directly  by the Fund as a result of  dividends  or
capital gains distributions  payable either in stock or in cash.  However,  each
participant  will pay a pro rata share of brokerage  commissions  incurred  with
respect  to the  Plan  Agent's  open-market  purchases  in  connection  with the
reinvestment  of dividends and capital gains  distributions  and voluntary  cash
payments made by the participant. Brokerage charges for purchasing small amounts
of stock for individual  accounts  through the Plan are expected to be less than
the usual brokerage charges for such  transactions,  because the Plan Agent will
be  purchasing  stock for all  participants  in blocks and  prorating  the lower
commissions thus attainable.

Dividends and Distributions (concluded)

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The  receipt of  dividends  and  distributions  under the Plan will not  relieve
participants  of any  income  tax  that  may be  payable  on such  dividends  or
distributions.

Experience  under the Plan may indicate that changes in the Plan are  desirable.
Accordingly, the Fund and the Plan Agent reserve the right to terminate the Plan
as applied to any voluntary cash payments made and any dividend or  distribution
paid  subsequent  to notice of the  termination  sent to  members of the Plan at
least 30 days before the record date for such dividend or distribution. The Plan
also may be amended by the Fund or the Plan Agent, but (except when necessary or
appropriate  to comply with  applicable  law,  rules or policies of a regulatory
authority) only by at least 30 days' written notice to participants in the Plan.
All  correspondence  concerning the Plan should be directed to the Plan Agent at
P.O. Box 43027, Westborough, Massachusetts 01581.
