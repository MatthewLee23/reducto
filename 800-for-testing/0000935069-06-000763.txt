To the Members and Board of Directors of
  UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C. (the "Fund"),  including the schedule
of portfolio investments,  as of December 31, 2005, and the related statement of
operations  and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of changes
in  members'  capital  for each of the two years in the  period  then  ended and
financial  highlights for each of the years indicated  therein.  These financial
statements  and  financial  highlights  are  the  responsibility  of the  Fund's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material  misstatement.  We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's  internal  control over  financial
reporting.  Our audit included  consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit  procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on the
effectiveness  of  the  Fund's  internal   control  over  financial   reporting.
Accordingly,  we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements and financial  highlights,  assessing the accounting  principles used
and  significant  estimates  made by  management,  and  evaluating  the  overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
securities  owned as of December 31, 2005 by  correspondence  with management of
the investment funds or by other appropriate  auditing  procedures where replies
were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of UBS
Technology Partners,  L.L.C. at December 31, 2005, the results of its operations
and its cash  flows for the year  then  ended and the  changes  in its  members'
capital for each of the two years in the period then  ended,  and the  financial
highlights for each of the indicated  years, in conformity  with U.S.  generally
accepted accounting principles.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2005

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.   ORGANIZATION

         UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized as
         a limited  partnership  under the laws of Delaware on December 28, 1998
         and  was  subsequently  reorganized  as  a  limited  liability  company
         effective October 15, 2002. The Fund is registered under the Investment
         Company Act of 1940,  as amended  (the "1940  Act"),  as a  closed-end,
         non-diversified,  management  investment company. The Fund's investment
         objective is to maximize capital  appreciation over the long-term.  The
         Fund pursues its investment objective by deploying its assets primarily
         among a select group of portfolio  managers who invest primarily in, or
         who have particular knowledge within, the technology sector. Generally,
         such  portfolio  managers  conduct their  investment  programs  through
         unregistered investment funds (collectively, the "Investment Funds") in
         which the Fund invests as a limited  partner or member along with other
         investors. The Fund commenced operations on April 1, 1999.

         The  Fund's  Board  of   Directors   (the   "Directors")   has  overall
         responsibility  to manage and control the business affairs of the Fund,
         including the exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish policies
         regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Fund's business.
         The  Directors  have engaged UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the "UBSFA" or
         "Manager"), a Delaware limited liability company and the Manager of the
         Fund,  to  provide   investment   advice  regarding  the  selection  of
         Investment Funds and to be responsible for the day-to-day management of
         the Fund.

         The Manager is an indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,
         Inc.,  which is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS AG, and is registered
         as an investment adviser under the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940, as
         amended.

         Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors
         may be  accepted at such times as the  Manager  may  determine  and are
         generally  accepted monthly.  The Fund reserves the right to reject any
         application for interests in the Fund.

         The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant
         to written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such
         times and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their
         complete and exclusive discretion.  The Manager expects that generally,
         it will  recommend to the  Directors  that the Fund offer to repurchase
         interests from Members twice in each year,  near mid-year and year-end.
         Members can only transfer or assign their  membership  interests,  or a
         portion  thereof,  (i) by  operation  of  law  pursuant  to the  death,
         bankruptcy,  insolvency or  dissolution  of a Member,  or (ii) with the
         written approval of the Directors,  which may be withheld in their sole
         and absolute discretion. Such transfers may be made even if the balance
         of the capital  account to such transferee is equal to or less than the
         transferor's initial capital contribution.

    2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

         A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION

         Net asset value of the Fund is determined by or at the direction of the
         Manager as of the close of business at the end of any fiscal  period in
         accordance  with the valuation  principles set forth below or as may be
         determined  from time to time pursuant to policies  established  by the
         Directors.

                                                                               6

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2005

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         A.  PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

         The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are subject to the terms and
         conditions  of  the  respective   operating   agreements  and  offering
         memoranda,  as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment Funds
         are carried at fair value as determined by the Fund's pro-rata interest
         in the net  assets of each  Investment  Fund.  All  valuations  utilize
         financial  information  supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of
         management and performance incentive fees or allocations payable to the
         Investment  Funds'  managers  or  pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'
         agreements.  The Fund's  valuation  procedures  require  the Manager to
         consider all relevant information available at the time the Fund values
         its  portfolio.  The  Manager  and/or  the  Board  will  consider  such
         information  and consider  whether it is  appropriate,  in light of all
         relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value
         as reported or whether to adjust such value. The underlying investments
         of each Investment Fund are accounted for at fair value as described in
         each Investment Fund's financial statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio
         Investments)

         Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in
         the form of cash or securities, are first applied as a reduction of the
         investment's cost.

         B.  INCOME RECOGNITION

         Interest  income is recorded on the accrual  basis.  Realized gains and
         losses  from  Investment  Fund   transactions  are  calculated  on  the
         identified cost basis.

         C.  FUND COSTS

         The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but
         not  limited  to,  the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to
         portfolio  transactions  and  positions for the Fund's  account;  legal
         fees;  accounting and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing
         the Fund's net asset value; costs of insurance;  registration expenses;
         certain organization costs; due diligence, including travel and related
         expenses; expenses of meetings of Directors and Members; all costs with
         respect to  communications  to  Members;  and other  types of  expenses
         approved  by the  Directors.  Offering  costs are charged to capital as
         incurred.

         D.  INCOME TAXES

         No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes
         has been  provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax.  Each
         Member is  individually  required  to report on its own tax  return its
         distributive share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

         The Fund has  reclassified  $3,584,275 and $6,474,200 from  accumulated
         net investment loss and accumulated net realized gain from investments,
         respectively,  to net  capital  contributions  during  the  year  ended
         December  31,  2005.  The   reclassification  was  to  reflect,  as  an
         adjustment to net capital  contributions,  the amount of taxable income
         or loss that have  been  allocated  to the  Fund's  Members  and had no
         effect on net assets.

                                                                               7

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2005

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

         E.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

         Cash and cash equivalents  consist of monies invested in a PNC Bank, NA
         account  which pays money  market rates and are  accounted  for at cost
         plus accrued  interest which is included in interest  receivable on the
         Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

         F.  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

         From time to time the Fund may enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
         connection  with such  transactions  it is the Fund's  policy  that its
         custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities,  the
         fair value of which  exceeds  the  principal  amount of the  repurchase
         transaction,  including accrued  interest,  at all times. If the seller
         defaults, and the fair value of the collateral declines, realization of
         the  collateral  by the Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of December
         31, 2005 there were no open repurchase agreements.

         G.  USE OF ESTIMATES

         The  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  U.S.
         generally accepted  accounting  principles requires the Manager to make
         estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported in the
         financial  statements and accompanying notes. The Manager believes that
         the estimates utilized in preparing the Fund's financial statements are
         reasonable and prudent; however, actual results could differ from these
         estimates.

    3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

         UBSFA provides certain  management and  administrative  services to the
         Fund, including,  among other things,  providing office space and other
         support  services.  In consideration  for such services,  the Fund pays
         UBSFA a monthly  management  fee (the "Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of
         the Fund's net assets,  excluding assets  attributable to the Manager's
         capital account.  The Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's assets and
         debited against the Members' capital accounts,  excluding the Manager's
         capital  account.  A  portion  of  the  fee is  paid  by  UBSFA  to its
         affiliates.

         UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of
         UBS Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without
         special  compensation from the Fund, and bears its own costs associated
         with its activities as placement agent. Placement fees, if any, charged
         on  contributions  are debited  against the  contribution  amounts,  to
         arrive  at a net  subscription  amount.  The  placement  fee  does  not
         constitute assets of the Fund.

         The net  increase  (or  decrease)  in  members'  capital  derived  from
         operations  (net income or loss) is initially  allocated to the capital
         accounts of all Members on a pro-rata  basis,  other than the Fee which
         is  similarly  allocated  to all  Members  other  than the  Manager  as
         described  above.  In  accordance  with the Limited  Liability  Company
         Agreement,  the  Manager  is then  allocated  an  amount  based  on the
         performance of the Fund (the  "Performance  Bonus") for the Measurement
         Period, as defined in the


                                                                               8

         first  to  occur of (1) a  fiscal  year-end  or (2) a whole or  partial
         redemption).  The  Performance  Bonus  is  calculated  separately  with
         respect to each Member.

         The  Performance  Bonus is equal to 1% of the  balance of the  Member's
         capital  account at the end of the  Measurement  Period,  provided that
         appreciation  in the Member's  capital  account (net of any Performance
         Bonus) exceeds the Member's  threshold return.  The threshold return is
         the amount that a Member  would have earned for a fiscal year if it had
         received an  annualized  rate of return of 20% on its  opening  capital
         account balance,  as adjusted.  No Performance Bonus was earned for the
         year ended December 31, 2005.

         Each  Director of the Fund receives a retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for
         each meeting attended. All Directors are reimbursed by the Fund for all
         reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses.  Total amounts expensed by the Fund
         related to Directors for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $23,000,
         included in miscellaneous on the Statements Of Operations.

    4.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

         PFPC Trust Company (an  affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as custodian
         (the "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial services
         for the Fund.

         PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as  Administrator
         and Accounting Agent to the Fund and in that capacity  provides certain
         administrative,  accounting,  record keeping,  tax and investor related
         services. PFPC Inc. receives a monthly fee primarily based upon (i) the
         average net assets of the Fund,  subject to a minimum  monthly fee, and
         (ii) the aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain other  investment
         funds  sponsored  or advised by UBS  Americas,  Inc. or it  affiliates.
         Additionally,  the  Fund  reimburses  certain  out of  pocket  expenses
         incurred by PFPC Inc.

    5.   CREDIT FACILITY

         Effective July 1, 2005, the Fund, along with other UBS sponsored funds,
         entered into a  $150,000,000  committed,  unsecured  revolving  line of
         credit with Harris Trust and Savings Bank.  Under the most  restrictive
         arrangement, the Fund may borrow an amount that combined with the other
         borrowings  of the Fund  would not exceed  20% of its net  assets.  The
         Fund's borrowing  capacity is also limited to the portion of the unused
         line of credit at any point in time.  The Fund is only liable under the
         line of credit to the  extent of its own  borrowing  there  under.  The
         interest  rate on the borrowing is based on the Federal Funds rate plus
         150  basis  points  per  annum.  The  expiration  date of  such  credit
         agreements is June 30, 2006. The committed facility also requires a fee
         to be paid by the Fund, on a pro-rata basis, based on the amount of the
         aggregate commitment which has not been utilized of 25 basis points per
         annum.  For the year  ended  December  31,  2005,  the  fund's  average
         interest rate on borrowings was 4.76% per annum and average  borrowings
         outstanding  were  $638,337.  Interest  expense  for the year  2005 was
         $30,416, all of which was paid during the year.

                                                                               9

    6.   SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

         Aggregate  purchases and sales of  Investment  Funds for the year ended
         December  31,  2005,   amounted  to   $52,000,000   and   $232,228,717,
         respectively.

         The cost of investments for Federal income tax purposes is adjusted for
         items of  taxable  income  allocated  to the Fund  from the  Investment
         Funds.  The  allocated  taxable  income is  reported to the Fund by the
         Investment  Funds on  Schedules  K-1. The Fund has not yet received all
         such schedule K-1 for the year ended December 31, 2005.

    7.   INVESTMENTS

         As of December 31, 2005, the Fund had investments in Investment  Funds,
         none  of  which  were  related  parties.  The  Fund's  investments  are
         summarized  below based on the  investment  objectives  of the specific
         Investment Funds at December 31, 2005.

                  Investment Objective             Cost          Fair Value
                  --------------------             ----          ----------
                    Long/Short Equity         $161,550,000      $240,952,467

         The agreements  related to investments in Investment  Funds provide for
         compensation to the general partners/managers in the form of management
         fees of 1% to 2% (per  annum) of net assets and  performance  incentive
         fees or allocations of 20% of net profits earned.  The Investment Funds
         provide for periodic redemptions, with lock up provisions ranging up to
         three years from initial  investment.  Detailed  information  about the
         Investment Funds' portfolios is not available.

    8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

         In the normal  course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the
         Fund invests trade various financial instruments and enter into various
         investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but
         are not limited to, short selling activities, writing option contracts,
         contracts for differences, and equity swaps. The Fund's risk of loss in
         these Investment Funds is limited to the value of these  investments as
         reported by the Fund.

    9.   INDEMNIFICATION

         In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts
         or  agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future
         events  could  occur  that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions
         against the Fund. Based on its history and experience, management feels
         the likelihood of such an event is remote.

                                                                              10

                        UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C.:
                         ADVISORY CONTRACT RENEWAL RIDER


         The Directors (including the Independent Directors) last evaluated the
Investment Advisory Agreement at a meeting on September 15, 2005. The Directors
met in an executive session during which they were advised by and had the
opportunity to discuss with independent legal counsel the approval of the
Investment Advisory Agreement. The Directors reviewed materials furnished by the
Adviser, including information regarding the Adviser, its affiliates and its
personnel, operations and financial condition. The Directors also reviewed,
among other things, the nature of the services to be provided by the Adviser,
including its investment process, and the experience of the investment advisory
and other personnel proposing to provide services to the Fund. The Directors
felt that the quality of service offered by the Adviser to the Fund was
appropriate and that the Adviser's personnel had sufficient expertise to manage
the Fund. The Directors also reviewed the performance of the Fund and compared
that performance to the performance of another investment company presented by
the Adviser which has objectives and strategies similar to those of the Fund and
which is managed by a third-party investment adviser (the "Comparable Fund").
The Directors determined that the performance of the Fund was consistent with
that of the Comparable Fund. Although the Fund's performance since inception was
less than that of the Comparable Fund, the Directors acknowledged the
limitations in such comparison because the Comparable Fund was not registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and therefore, it is not subject to
investment restrictions that are applicable to the Fund and which can adversely
affect the Fund's performance relative to that of the Comparable
<PAGE>

Fund. The Directors also compared the volatility of the Fund to that of the
Comparable Fund presented. They noted that the Fund's volatility was higher than
the volatility of the Comparable Fund. The Directors also considered the
advisory fees being charged by the Adviser for its services as compared to those
charged to the Comparable Fund, and as compared to the advisory fees charged by
the Adviser and its affiliates for other UBS alternative products. The
information presented to the Directors showed that the advisory fees being
charged to the Fund were less than those being charged to the Comparable Fund.
In comparing the advisory fees being charged to the Fund to the fees being
charged by the Adviser and its affiliates for other UBS alternative investment
products, the Directors noted that the management fee being charged to the Fund
was equal to the lowest management fee being charged to each of the Alternative
Investment Group's other multi-manager funds, and the Fund's incentive fee was
below the median incentive fee being charged other multi-manager funds. In light
of the foregoing, the Directors felt that the combination of management fee and
incentive fee being charged to the Fund was appropriate. The Directors also
considered the profitability of the Adviser both before payment to brokers and
after payment to brokers and concluded that the profits to be realized by the
Adviser and its affiliates under the Investment Advisory Agreement and from
other relationships between the Fund and the Adviser were within a range the
Directors considered reasonable and appropriate. The Directors also discussed
the fact that the Fund was not large enough at that time to support a request
for breakpoints due to economies of scale. The Directors determined that the
fees under the Investment Advisory Agreement do not constitute fees that are so
disproportionately large as to bear no reasonable relationship to the services
rendered and that could not have been the product of arm's-length bargaining,
and concluded that the fees were reasonable. The Directors concluded that
approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement was in the best interests of the
Fund and its investors.

         subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser),  and any
         entity  controlling,  controlled  by, or under common  control with the
         investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  registrant
         that were not  pre-approved  pursuant to paragraph  (c)(7)(ii)  of Rule

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE  OF  PROXY  VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR CLOSED-END
        MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Proxy Voting Policies are as follows:

                            UBS FUND ADVISOR, L.L.C.

                      PROXY-VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES



A. INTRODUCTION
         UBS Fund Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the "Adviser")  votes proxies for each fund
(each a "Fund," collectively,  the "Funds") for which it acts as the Adviser and
as such, has adopted these Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures (these "Policies
and  Procedures").  The  Funds  are  funds of funds  that  invest  primarily  in
unregistered investment vehicles ("Investment Funds") which have investors other
than the Fund. Generally,  each of the Funds may invest a majority of its assets
in non-voting securities of Investment Funds.

The  Investment  Funds  typically do not submit  matters to investors  for vote;
however,  should a matter be  submitted  for vote and  provided  the Fund  holds
voting  interests in the Investment  Fund, the Adviser will vote proxies in what
it views to be in the best  interest  of the Fund and in  accordance  with these
Policies and Procedures.

B. FIDUCIARY DUTY

         Proxy-voting is an integral part of the Adviser's investment management
process.  The Adviser is under a fiduciary  duty to act in the best  interest of
the Fund(s) and to vote in a manner it believes to be consistent with efforts to
maximize  shareholder  value. This authority carries with it a responsibility on
the  Adviser's  part to  analyze  the  issues  connected  with the  votes and to
evaluate the probable impact of its vote on the value of the investment.

C. VOTING PROCEDURES

         Generally speaking, where the Adviser holds voting rights, it will vote
consistent  with  management's  recommendations  on  routine  matters,  absent a
particular  reason  to the  contrary.  Non-routine  matters  will be  voted on a
case-by-case  basis taking into  consideration the best interests of the Fund(s)
and the maximization of shareholder value.

D. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
         Any  circumstance  or relationship  which would  compromise a portfolio
manager's  objectivity  in voting  proxies in the best  interest  of the Fund(s)
would constitute a conflict of interest.  In such  situations,  the Adviser will
address any material  conflicts  before voting proxies on behalf of the Fund(s).
As a matter of policy,  the Adviser will presume the  existence of a conflict of
interest for proxy-voting purposes in situations where:

    o    A current investor of the Adviser is affiliated with an Investment Fund
         soliciting  proxies or has  communicated  its view to the Adviser on an
         impending proxy vote;
<PAGE>

    o    The portfolio  manager  responsible for  proxy-voting  has identified a
         personal  interest in the Investment Fund soliciting  proxies or in the
         outcome of a shareholder vote;

    o    Members of the  portfolio  management  team,  including  the  portfolio
         manager   responsible  for  proxy-voting,   and/or  members  of  senior
         management,   have  a  personal  interest  through  investment  in  the
         Investment Fund soliciting proxies;

    o    Members of the Investment Fund or a third party with an interest in the
         outcome of a shareholder  vote have  attempted to influence  either the
         Adviser or the portfolio manager responsible for voting a proxy.


         Employees of the Adviser should be aware of the potential for conflicts
of  interest  that may  result,  on the  part of the  Adviser,  from  employees'
personal  relationships or special  circumstances that may result as part of the
Adviser's  normal  course of  business.  Employees  who become aware of any such
conflicts of interest are under obligation to bring them to the attention of the
Chief  Compliance  Officer,  Legal or the Risk  Control  Manager  (or  designees
thereof)  who will work with  appropriate  personnel of the Adviser to determine
the materiality of the conflict.

         ADDRESSING MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  A conflict of interest will
be considered material to the extent it is determined that such conflict has the
potential to influence the Adviser's decision-making in the proxy-voting process
and the determination will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and
circumstances.

         If it is determined  that a conflict of interest is not  material,  the
Adviser may vote proxies  notwithstanding  the  existence of the  conflict.  The
Adviser shall maintain a written record of all conflicts of interest identified,
the  materiality  determination,  and the method  used to resolve  the  material
conflict of interest.

If it is determined that a conflict of interest is material, the Adviser's Chief
Compliance Officer or Legal will work with appropriate  personnel of the Adviser
to determine a resolution  before  voting  proxies  affected by such conflict of
interest. Resolutions may include:

    o    Disclosing  the conflict and  obtaining  consent  before  voting (which
         consent  in the case of the  Fund(s)  may be  obtained  from the Fund's
         board of directors);


    o    Engaging  another  party on behalf of the  Fund(s) to vote the proxy on
         its behalf;


    o    Engaging a third party to  recommend  a vote with  respect to the proxy
         based on application of the policies set forth herein; or


    o    Such  other  method as is deemed  appropriate  under the  circumstances
         given the nature of the conflict.


E. ANNUAL FILING OF PROXY VOTING RECORD
<PAGE>

         The Adviser will file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect
to the Fund(s)  during the preceding  twelve-month  period ended June 30 on Form
N-PX, no later than August 31st of the then year.

F. PROXY-VOTING DISCLOSURES

         Where the Funds hold voting  rights,  the Funds shall  include in their
Form N-CSR (Certified  Shareholder Report) : (i) a description of these Policies
and  Procedures;  (ii) a statement  that a  description  of these  Policies  and
Procedures  is available  without  charge,  upon request by taking the specified
action;  and (iii) a statement that information  regarding how the Adviser voted
proxies  relating  to the Funds  during  the most  recent  12-month  period,  is
available upon request, without charge by taking the specified action.

G. CONTROL PROCESS

To ensure compliance with these Policies and Procedures, at the time of a fund's
investment in an Investment Fund, the subscription  document will be reviewed to
ensure that voting rights have been waived, as is current practice. In the event
a fund does not waive voting  rights,  the Adviser will adhere to these Policies
and Procedures.

H. RECORD-KEEPING

         The  Adviser  shall   maintain  the  following   records   relating  to
proxy-voting  in an  easily  accessible  place for a period of not less than six
years from the end of the fiscal  year  during  which the last entry was made on
such record, the first two years on-site:

    o    A copy of the Adviser's current Proxy-Voting Policies and Procedures;


    o    A record of each vote cast by the Adviser on behalf of the Fund(s);


    o    A copy of each proxy  solicitation  (including  proxy  statements)  and
         related materials with regard to each vote;


    o    A copy of any document relating to the identification and resolution of
         conflicts of interest;


    o    A copy of any  document  created by the Adviser  that was material to a
         proxy  -voting  decision  or  that  memorialized  the  basis  for  that
         decision; and


    o    A copy of each  written  investor  request for  information  on how the
         Adviser  voted  proxies  on  behalf of the  Fund(s),  and a copy of any
         written  response  from the Adviser to any  (written or oral)  investor
         request for  information  on how the Adviser voted proxies on behalf of
         the Fund(s).


ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.
<PAGE>

                         UBS TECHNOLOGY PARTNERS, L.L.C.
                          PORTFOLIO MANAGER DISCLOSURE

         The  registrant  (also  referred  to as the  "Fund")  is  managed  by a
portfolio management team, each member of which (each, a "Portfolio Manager" and
together, the "Portfolio Managers") is responsible for the day-to-day management
of the Fund's portfolio. Norman E. Sienko, Jr., the lead member of the portfolio
management  team,  is  primarily  responsible  for the  selection  of the Fund's
investments,  and is jointly responsible for the allocation of the Fund's assets
among  Investment  Funds.  Russell  Sinder,  the other  member of the  portfolio
management  team,  is primarily  responsible  for the  allocation  of the Fund's
investments.

         Mr.  Sienko has been  associated  with UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.,  the
Fund's  Adviser since prior to 2000,  and he is also a Senior Vice  President of
UBS Financial  Services Inc.  ("UBS  Financial  Services").  Mr. Sinder has been
associated with the Adviser since 1998, and he is also a First Vice President of
UBS Financial Services.

         The Fund's Portfolio Managers manage multiple accounts for the Adviser,
including  registered  closed-end funds and private domestic and offshore pooled
investment vehicles.

         Potential  conflicts  of interest  may arise  because of the  Portfolio
Managers' management of the Fund and other accounts.  For example,  conflicts of
interest may arise with the allocation of investment transactions and allocation
of limited  investment  opportunities.  Allocations of investment  opportunities
generally  could raise a  potential  conflict of interest to the extent that the
Portfolio  Managers  may have an  incentive  to  allocate  investments  that are
expected to increase in value to  preferred  accounts.  Conversely,  a Portfolio
Manager  could favor one account  over  another in the amount or the sequence in
which orders to redeem  investments  are placed.  The Portfolio  Managers may be
perceived  to have a conflict of  interest if there are a large  number of other
accounts,  in  addition  to the Fund,  that they are  managing  on behalf of the
Adviser.  In  addition,  each  Portfolio  Manager  could be  viewed  as having a
conflict of interest to the extent that one or more  Portfolio  Managers have an
investment in accounts other than the Fund. The Adviser periodically reviews the
Portfolio  Managers'  overall  responsibilities  to ensure that they are able to
allocate the necessary time and resources to effectively manage the Fund.

         Other  accounts may have  investment  objectives,  strategies and risks
that differ from those of the Fund.  For these or other  reasons,  the Portfolio
Managers may purchase different investments for the Fund and the other accounts,
and the  performance  of  investments  purchased  for the Fund may vary from the
performance  of the  investments  purchased  for other  accounts.  The Portfolio
Managers may place transactions on behalf of other accounts that are directly or
indirectly contrary to investment  decisions made for the Fund, which could have
the potential to adversely impact the Fund, depending on market conditions.

         A  potential  conflict  of  interest  may be  perceived  if the Adviser
receives a  performance-based  advisory  fee as to one account but not  another,
because a Portfolio  Manager may favor the  account  subject to the  performance
fee,  whether or not the  performance  of that account  directly  determines the
Portfolio Manager's compensation.

         The Adviser's  goal is to provide high quality  investment  services to
all of its clients,  while meeting its fiduciary obligation to treat all clients
fairly.  The  Adviser  has  adopted and  implemented  policies  and  procedures,
including  brokerage  and trade  allocation  policies  and  procedures,  that it
believes address the conflicts  associated with managing  multiple  accounts for
multiple  clients.  In  addition,  the  Adviser  monitors  a  variety  of areas,
including  compliance with Fund guidelines.
<PAGE>

Furthermore,  senior investment and business personnel at UBS Financial Services
periodically review the performance of the Portfolio Managers.

         The Portfolio Managers'  compensation is comprised primarily of a fixed
salary  and a  discretionary  bonus  paid  by  UBS  Financial  Services  or  its
affiliates and not by the Fund. A portion of the discretionary bonus may be paid
in shares of stock or stock  options of UBS AG, the ultimate  parent  company of
the  Adviser,  subject to certain  vesting  periods.  The amount of a  Portfolio
Manager's  discretionary  bonus,  and the  portion to be paid in shares or stock
options of UBS AG, is determined by senior  officers of UBS Financial  Services.
In general,  the amount of the bonus will be based on a combination  of factors,
none of which is necessarily  weighted more than any other factor. These factors
may  include:  the  overall  performance  of  UBS  Financial  Services  and  its
Alternative   Investment   Group;  the  overall   performance  of  UBS  AG;  the
profitability to UBS Financial  Services derived from the management of the Fund
and the other accounts managed by the Alternative Investment Group; the absolute
performance  of the  Fund  and  such  other  accounts  for the  preceding  year;
contributions by the Portfolio  Manager to assisting in managing the Alternative
Investment  Group;  participation  by  the  Portfolio  Manager  in  training  of
personnel;  and support by the Portfolio  Manager  generally to colleagues.  The
bonus is not based on a precise formula, benchmark or other metric.

         The  following  table  lists the  number  and  types of other  accounts
advised by the Fund's Portfolio Managers and approximate assets under management
in those accounts as of the end of the Fund's most recent fiscal year.
