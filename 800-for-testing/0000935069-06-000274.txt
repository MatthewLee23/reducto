       FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                               SEMI-ANNUAL REPORT
                                NOVEMBER 30, 2005

Dear Shareholders:

We are pleased to inform you that your Fund, the First Trust/Four Corners Senior
Floating Rate Income Fund II (NYSE: FCT), has continued to provide attractive
monthly income for the period ended November 30, 2005. While interest rates have
continued to rise, fueling steady dividend increases for the Fund, the dividend
distribution rate has increased from 6.2% as of May 31, to 7.7%, as of November
30, based on the Fund's market price.

The Fund, composed primarily of senior secured floating rate corporate loans,
seeks to provide a high level of current income. As a secondary objective, the
Fund will attempt to preserve capital. For the six months ended November 30,
2005, the Fund's market price total return was -3.3%. Despite pressure on the
market price, the Fund's net asset value ("NAV") total return over the same
period was 3.8%. This compares favorably to its benchmark, the Standard &
Poor's/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index, which posted a 3.1% gain over the same
six-month period.

The Fund is managed by Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners"), a
leading asset management firm that specializes in the sub-investment grade and
structured finance markets. The portfolio management team, including the credit
research analysts, collectively has over 100 years' experience in all aspects of
the senior loan market, including structuring, underwriting, researching,
trading, managing and investing in senior loans.

I encourage you to read the portfolio commentary from Michael P. McAdams and
Robert I. Bernstein, Co-Portfolio Managers, found on the following pages, for
more details about the Fund's performance and the management strategy. We thank
you for your confidence in First Trust Advisors L.P. and Four Corners and we
will work diligently to keep earning it.

Sincerely,

/S/ JAMES A. BOWEN

A COMMENTARY ON THE FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

The First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the
"Fund") posted a market price total return of -3.3% for the six-month period
ended November 30, 2005. The Fund's net asset value (or "NAV") total return for
the period was 3.8%. During the period, the Fund paid dividends totaling $0.5922
per share, reflecting four separate dividend increases from $0.0927 to $0.1075
per share, or an increase of 16.0%. Based on the most recent dividend, FCT
provided a distribution rate of 7.7% based on the Fund's market price, and 6.8%
based on the Fund's NAV as of November 30, 2005. The Fund's stock
exchange-listed market price declined 6.5% over the period.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT

The first half of the Fund's 2006 fiscal year continued to benefit from a
favorable economic environment for senior floating-rate loan investing. During
the period, the Federal Reserve (the "Fed") continued to increase domestic
short-term interest rates. With each increase, the Fed indirectly increased the
amount of floating rate interest owed by the Fund's corporate borrowers to their
lenders, thereby contributing to the Fund's dividend increases.

Underlying the increase in short-term interest rates has been solid U.S.
economic expansion despite the devastation from the Gulf hurricanes and concern
for elevated energy prices. While residential housing markets may be softening
slightly for the first time in several years, job growth and factory utilization
remain drivers of increased demand for resources, inflationary pressures and
economic growth. As evidence, in the quarter ended September 30, 2005, Gross
Domestic Product rose at a strong annual rate of 4.1%. Similarly, improved
corporate cash flow levels have contributed to continued low corporate debt
default rates; for the period ended September 30, 2005, Standard & Poor's
calculated that defaults were 1.3%, which is lower than the long-term domestic
average of 3.6%. Nevertheless, defaults have increased slightly of late due to
continuing issues in the automotive and airline sectors (to which the Fund has
minimal exposure) and from unanticipated events such as fraud and unusually
severe hurricanes.

Reflecting the potential for continued economic growth and a lower-than-average
default environment, corporations have increased their willingness to borrow,
thereby providing an increase in the number of opportunities in which to invest.
New institutional Senior Loan issuance rose 23% from the prior year for the
year-to-date period ended November 2005. Similarly, Senior Loan market
liquidity, as measured by secondary loan trading volume, grew 9.7%
year-over-year to over $129 billion in secondary loan trades for the nine months
ended September 2005.

Since the beginning of 2005 we have seen reduced credit spreads (that somewhat
limited the Fund's dividend growth in the Spring). We have more recently seen a
stabilization of credit spreads that, when combined with Fed rate increases,
have resulted in an improved environment for dividend increases. In addition,
the current market reflects a better balance of inflows into the Senior Loan
asset class relative to the volume of new issues and prepayments. The
stabilized, but still historically low, level of spreads reflects the markets'
low concern for defaults over the short to medium term. Indeed, Standard &
Poor's predicts that the default rate will remain below the long-term average
for at least the next 12 months.

We also remain comfortable with credit standards of new issue loans and continue
to see the risk/return advantage of Senior Loans as representing considerable
value in comparison to the loan markets' recent history as well as relative to
the outlooks for other asset classes.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

As previously mentioned, the investment philosophy of Four Corners Capital
Management, LLC ("Four Corners") is intended to generate high income with
relatively less volatility throughout a variety of market conditions. The Fund
also remains a "pure play" strategy that focuses on Senior Loans, generally
avoiding investments in riskier but higher yielding "junk" bonds. In the long
run, we believe that our strategy may result in lower NAV volatility and
potentially better NAV returns than a strategy relying upon high yield bonds to
pay a slightly higher dividend in the short run.

The investment strategy used to implement our philosophy focuses on thorough
fundamental credit analysis, broad issuer and industry diversification and a
proactive sell discipline in order to minimize risk. The Fund's portfolio is
generally more heavily weighted towards companies and industries from which we
expect to see lower earnings volatility and from which we expect to see higher
recoveries for senior lenders in circumstances where cash flow volatility does
occur. For example, the Fund has had very little exposure to the automotive and
airline industries, which have performed poorly based on weak industry
fundamentals as evidenced by recent defaults in the sectors.

        A COMMENTARY ON THE FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE
                          INCOME FUND II - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund remains broadly diversified with over 175 positions across 36
industries. At November 30, 2005, the five largest individual borrower exposures
in total represented 10.2% of the Fund's total investments. The Fund also has
the flexibility to invest up to 10% of the portfolio in Special Situation debt
investments, which are typically investments in companies that are either in
default or experiencing financial difficulties. Given the growth and improvement
in the economy during the last year, we have seen few attractive opportunities
in this segment of the market. As a result, the portfolio contained only two
Special Situation investments, representing 2.9% of the Fund's total
investments.

The Fund's investment quality, measured by independent credit rating agencies,
has changed relatively little from the prior period. The Fund is predominately
invested in loans rated between BB and B. While our strategy focuses on such
non-investment grade credit, Senior Loans we buy are senior and collateralized
relative to other debt or equity of the same issuer, thus reducing the
probability of substantial losses.

As mentioned in prior reports, the Fund is leveraged using both adjustable-rate
Auction Market Preferred Shares and an asset-backed commercial paper conduit.
The terms and conditions of the leverage provide the Fund with the ability to
borrow on a floating-rate basis. Since the income generated by the Fund's Senior
Loan investment portfolio is also floating rate-based, the Fund is substantially
less exposed to risk from interest rate increases than would be a leveraged fund
that invests in fixed-rate bonds. And, as Fund assets and liabilities tend to
move in tandem, either up or down, portfolio leverage benefits investors
regardless of the direction of rates. At November 30, 2005, the portfolio
leverage accounted for 35.1% of the Fund's total assets.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW

For the 6-month period ended November 30, 2005, the Fund's NAV-based total
return was 3.8%. This return exceeded the benchmark (the Standard & Poor's/LSTA
Leveraged Loan Index) return of 3.1%. A portion of the Fund's performance is
attributable to the beneficial impact of leverage and the negative impact of
fees, expenses and cash balances, which are not included in the benchmark
return. As mentioned above, the Fund's dividend was increased on four separate
occasions during the period, totaling a 16.0% increase to $0.1075 in November.
Additionally, the Fund's NAV had relatively low volatility, ranging from a low
of $18.87 to a high of $19.20 ending the period at $19.00. The Fund's NAV
performance over the period was influenced by a number of factors. We actively
managed the portfolio, generating trading gains when available, as well as
taking losses to reduce exposure to firms whose circumstances may have changed
since our initial purchase. Despite the Fund's positive NAV total return, the
Fund's market price total return was -3.3% during the period.

In October, one of the Fund's investments, a Senior Loan issued by Refco Inc.,
experienced a sudden and serious reversal resulting in the eventual bankruptcy
filing by part of the firm. The firm's problem arose from the discovery of
fraudulently unreported financial dealings between the company and its CEO and a
subsequent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation; the CEO was
arrested and has been charged with accounting fraud. As background, Refco was
one of the world's leading brokerage, commodities trading and derivative firms.
The Refco loan was part of a recapitalization when the company went public just
this past summer in a transaction led by Credit Suisse First Boston, Goldman
Sachs and Bank of America. Previously, the management had been highly regarded
and Four Corners had successfully invested in prior bank loan issues of the
firm.

Consistent with our strategy to, whenever possible, reduce exposure to problem
credits, we sold the position based upon a variety of concerns including
reported loss of clients and potential for further regulatory action. The sale
resulted in a loss of $0.11 per share in NAV. While the ultimate outcome of
Refco's situation remains uncertain, and mindful that every situation has its
own unique facts, we believe that the prompt sale of investments is a proven
means of minimizing downside in deteriorating situations.

Despite the isolated and unusual situation with Refco and the recently
well-publicized (although long-developing) concerns about the U.S. automotive
and airline industries that Four Corners has successfully avoided, we do not
currently plan to change our outlook for Senior Loan investing. This view is
consistent with the above-mentioned fundamental economic strength and continuing
relative conservatism of new loan origination standards.

In closing, we remain disappointed that the broader market has not placed a
higher value on demonstrated performance and the lower volatility-focused
strategy of the Fund. We note, though, that the Fund trades at a discount
comparable to other funds with loan-based strategies. We are also pleased to
have received favorable research opinions from several brokerage firms,
including Wachovia Securities, Raymond James & Associates and Ryan Beck & Co. We
feel that as of November 30, 2005, the Fund had an attractive and competitive
distribution rate of 7.7% based on market price.

We remain committed to delivering long-term performance and superior client
support and appreciate the opportunity to assist in meeting your investment
goals.

FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS - (CONTINUED)
NOVEMBER 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

       *    Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
            prepayment. Because of the mandatory prepayment conditions and
            because there may be significant economic incentives for a borrower
            to optionally prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans may occur. As a
            result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans may be
            substantially less than the stated maturities shown. Senior Loans
            generally have maturities that range from five to eight years;
            however, the Fund estimates that refinancing and prepayments result
            in an average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio to
            be approximately 18-30 months.
      **    Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at
            rates which are periodically predetermined by reference to a base
            lending rate plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally
            (i) the lending rate offered by one or more major European banks,
            such as the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime
            rate offered by one or more major United States banks or (iii) the
            certificate of deposit rate.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

                               1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund will attempt to preserve capital. The
Fund will pursue these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is computed based
upon the value of the Fund's portfolio and other assets. The NAV is determined
as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time,
on each day the NYSE is open for trading. Domestic debt securities and foreign
securities are priced using data reflecting the earlier closing of the principal
markets for those securities. The Fund calculates NAV per Common Share by
subtracting the Fund's liabilities (including accrued expenses, dividends
payable and any borrowings of the Fund) and the liquidation value of any
outstanding Preferred Shares from the Fund's Managed Assets (the value of
securities and other investments the Fund holds plus cash or other assets,
including interest accrued but not yet received) and dividing the result by the
total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value according
to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of the Fund's
assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties. In the
event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing service does
not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations are deemed
unreliable, or if events occurring after the close of the principal markets for
particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities), but before
the Fund values its assets, would materially affect NAV, First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities
and investments. The use of fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically, Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior
Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior
Loan at a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than
one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as
of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange
representing the principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities
traded in the over-the-counter market, but excluding securities traded on the
NASDAQ, are valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature
in less than 60 days are valued at amortized cost.

                                                                         Page 21

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

B. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such securities
is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund instructs the custodian to
segregate assets of the Fund with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued purchase commitments.

D. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded loan commitments of approximately $6,267,764
as of November 30, 2005. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at
the borrower's discretion. Net unrealized depreciation of $64,955 from these
commitments is included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

E. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in restricted securities. Restricted
securities are securities that cannot be offered for public sale without first
being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Fund
currently holds the restricted securities shown in the following table. These
securities are valued using market quotations according to the valuation
procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation section (Note 2A) and are not
expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted
security. There are no unrestricted securities with the same maturity dates and
yields for these issuers.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

F. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of distributions
made by the Fund.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal year ended May 31,
2005 was as follows:

                                                 2005
                                             -------------
Distributions paid from:

Ordinary Income ..........................   $  24,738,405

As of May 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis were
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income ............   $   1,499,092
Net Unrealized Depreciation ..............   $  (2,494,455)

G. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and by distributing substantially all of its net investment
income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for federal or state income taxes.

H. EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

I. COMMON SHARE ORGANIZATION AND OFFERING COSTS:

Organization costs consist of costs incurred to establish the Fund and enable it
to legally do business. These costs include filing fees, listing fees, legal
services pertaining to the organization of the business and audit fees relating
to the initial registration and auditing the initial statement of assets and
liabilities, among other fees. Offering costs consist of legal fees pertaining
to the Fund's shares offered for sale, registration fees, underwriting fees, and
printing of the initial prospectus, among other fees. First Trust and Four
Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor") have paid
all organization expenses and all offering costs of the Fund (other than sales
load) that exceeded $0.04 per Common Share. The Fund's estimated share of Common
Share offering costs, $920,000 and $89,209, in fiscal years 2004 and 2005,
respectively, was recorded as a reduction of the proceeds from the sale of
Common Shares.

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage, L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average daily gross asset value of
the Fund minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid dividends on any
outstanding AMP Shares and accrued liabilities.

                                                                         Page 23

Four Corners serves as the Fund's sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives a portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

The Fund pays each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust or
any of its affiliates an annual retainer of $10,000, which includes compensation
for all regular quarterly board meetings and regular committee meetings. No
additional meeting fees are paid in connection with regular quarterly board
meetings or regular committee meetings. Additional fees of $1,000 and $500 are
paid to non-interested Trustees for special board meetings and non-regular
committee meetings, respectively. These additional fees are shared by the funds
in the First Trust fund complex that participate in the particular meeting and
are not per fund fees. Trustees are also reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with all meetings.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term investments, for the six months ended November 30, 2005, were
$211,890,328 and $252,834,557, respectively.

As of November 30, 2005, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all
securities in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $3,713,348
and the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which
there was an excess of tax cost over value was $1,504,137.

                                5. COMMON SHARES

As of November 30, 2005, 25,272,768 of $0.01 par value Common Shares were

</TABLE>

                       6. AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of November 30, 2005, the Fund
has 2,000 Series A and 2,000 Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP
Shares") outstanding at a liquidation value of $25,000 per share. The AMP Shares
offering costs of $299,751 and commissions of $1,000,000, paid directly to
Lehman Brothers, were charged to capital of Common Shares for the year ended May
31, 2005.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of November 30, 2005 was 3.95% and 4.10%
for the Series A 7 day and Series B 28 day auctions, respectively. The dividend
rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates. These rates may vary in a manner not related directly
to the income received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a
beneficial or detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to
Common Shareholders.

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.

                          7. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

On August 2, 2004, the Fund entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility
("Credit Facility") with various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as
agent, to be used as leverage for the Fund. On August 1, 2005, this Credit
Facility was amended to extend its expiration date to July 31, 2006. The Credit
Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets
are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the requirements of the
1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have an "asset
coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after
borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is $195,000,000. For
the six months ended November 30, 2005, the average amount outstanding was
$167,759,563, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.54%. The Fund also pays
additional borrowing costs, which include an administration fee of 0.02%, a
program fee of 0.20% and a liquidity fee of 0.14% per year. Such expenses are
included in "Interest and fees on outstanding loan payable" on the Statement of
Operations.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On November 21, 2005, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.111 per share, which
represents a dividend from net investment income to Common Shareholders of
record December 5, 2005, payable December 12, 2005.

On December 20, 2005, the Fund declared distributions totaling $0.1318 per
share, which represents a dividend from net investment income of $0.1148 and
short-term capital gains of $0.0170, to Common Shareholders of record December
30, 2005, payable January 17, 2006.

                                                                         Page 25

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                          NOVEMBER 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by PFPC
Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common Shares under the Plan. If you
elect to receive cash distributions, you will receive all distributions in cash
paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc. as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If the Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV")
            at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If the Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation,
            the Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (800) 331-1710, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PFPC Inc., 301 Bellevue
Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

         CFR 270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the registrant's  second fiscal
         quarter  of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has  materially
