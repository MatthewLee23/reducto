Franklin Templeton Investments

GAIN FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE


Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager structure combines the specialized
expertise of three world-class investment management groups--Franklin, Templeton
and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE

Each of our portfolio management groups operates autonomously, relying on its
own research and staying true to the unique investment disciplines that underlie
its success.

FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a leader in tax-free investing and a
driving force in fixed income investing around the globe. They also bring
expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity investing.

TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered international investing and, in
1954, launched what has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today, with
research offices in over 25 countries, they offer investors the broadest global
reach in the industry.

MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is dedicated to a unique style of
value investing, searching aggressively for opportunity among undervalued
stocks, arbitrage situations and distressed companies.


TRUE DIVERSIFICATION

Because our management groups work independently and adhere to distinctly
different investment approaches, Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series funds
typically have a low overlap of securities. That's why our funds can be used to
build truly diversified portfolios covering every major asset class.


RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST

At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to consistently provide investors
with exceptional risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as the
reliable account services that have helped us become one of the most trusted
names in financial services.

Franklin Templeton
Limited Duration Income Trust

YOUR FUND'S GOALS AND PRIMARY INVESTMENTS: Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust seeks to provide high, current income, with a secondary objective
of capital appreciation to the extent possible, through a portfolio consisting
primarily of high yield corporate bonds, floating rate bank loans and mortgage-
and other asset-backed securities.



Dear Shareholder:

We are pleased to bring you Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust's
first annual report covering the period from the Fund's commencement of
operations on August 27, 2003, through March 31, 2004.


PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust posted a cumulative total
return of +7.11% based on net asset value and +3.16% based on market price from
the Fund's commencement of operations on August 27, 2003, through March 31,
2004. Share price, as measured by net asset value, rose from $14.33 per share on
August 27, 2003, to $14.75 at period-end, and the market price decreased from
$15.00 to $14.87 over the same period. You can find the Fund's performance data
in the Performance Summary on page 6.

                                                               Annual Report | 1
<PAGE>
ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

Over the seven-month reporting period, the U.S. economy experienced a healthy
pace of expansion. However, much of the fixed income markets' focus was directed
toward a somewhat mixed employment picture. Although the unemployment rate
declined over the period, from 6.1% to 5.7%, job creation was slower than many
market participants anticipated.1 The lack of new jobs helped drive a drop in
interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling from 4.54% to 3.86%.
However, lower interest rates meant reduced mortgage rates, enabling many
homeowners to refinance their mortgages. Refinancing activity helped keep home
sales and prices near three-year highs. These events, combined with personal
income tax reductions, helped improve consumers' net worths and spending
ability, thereby supporting the country's economic growth.

Increased business spending also contributed to economic growth. After having
been nearly absent since the end of 2000, business spending was quite robust in
the latter half of 2003. Nonresidential investment spending rose at annualized
rates of 12.8% and 10.9% in 2003's third and fourth quarters.2 Lower interest
rates enabled many businesses to refinance their old debt at more attractive
levels, in turn boosting profits and operating performance.

Productivity also continued to grow, which helped businesses generate more goods
and services without substantially raising inflation and labor costs. The core
Consumer Price Index, a measure of inflation that excludes food and energy, rose
1.6% for March 2004 compared with the same month a year earlier. Expected
inflation is a key determinant of interest rates, and recent, subdued inflation
contributed to the historically low interest rate environment throughout the
reporting period. In addition to the positive effect of declining interest rates
on the economy, corporate dividend tax reductions supported economic growth.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest in a diversified mix of fixed income securities, primarily high yield
corporate bonds, senior secured floating rate bank loans, and mortgage- and
other asset-backed securities. Our top-down analysis of macroeconomic trends
combined with a bottom-up fundamental analysis of market sectors, industries and
issuers drives our investment process. We seek to maintain a limited duration,
or interest rate sensitivity, to moderate the impact that fluctuating interest
rates might have on the Fund's fixed income portfolio. Within the corporate bond
and bank loan sectors, we seek securities trading at reasonable valuations from
issuers with characteristics such as strong market positions, stable cash flows,
reasonable capital structures, supportive asset values, strong sponsorship and
improving credit fundamentals. In the mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities sector, we look to capture an attractive income stream and total
return through our analysis of security prepayment assumptions, pricing
inefficiencies, and underlying collateral characteristics.


MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

In terms of bond sector allocation, at period-end the Fund's largest weighting
was in high yield corporate bonds, given our positive fundamental outlook. The
second-largest weighting was in floating rate bank loans, which we believed
could benefit from an improving credit cycle while offering the added advantage
of reduced interest rate sensitivity.

Among high yield corporate bonds, improving company earnings and declining
default rates drove the sector's relatively strong returns since the Fund's
August 2003 launch. As a result, high yield corporate bond yield spreads over
comparable-maturity U.S. Treasuries narrowed to about 5% by March 31, 2004 --
somewhat tighter than longer-term averages. We maintained our largest weighting
in this sector based on our favorable outlook for corporate fundamentals and
credit measures, combined with high yield corporate bonds' historically lower
level of interest rate sensitivity.

<PAGE>

During the period under review, the floating rate bank loan market, where the
Fund held 26.6% of total assets at period-end, remained strong, benefiting our
underlying holdings within the sector. Rising credit quality and healthy demand
from traditional and non-traditional loan investors such as hedge funds and
other institutional vehicles helped push loan prices higher. Much of the demand
was spurred by generally improving credit quality and prospects for higher
interest rates in the future, a situation that would benefit bank loans' yield
payouts given their periodic floating rate adjustment to short-term interest
rates. Declining default rates indicated the loan market's improving credit
quality, and by March 31, 2004, independent credit rating agency Standard &
Poor's loan default rate declined to 1.5% (as measured by number of all loans),
down from 2.3% at year-end 2003 and 4.5% in 2002.

During the period under review, we used our research to uncover areas of the
markets where we thought mortgage risk may have offered value. In the recent
interest rate environment, we looked to add to those positions with valuations
that we considered attractive, consistent with our investment strategy. In terms
of coupon, we invested across a wide spectrum of securities. Against the
backdrop of declining interest rates, the mortgage-backed market provided
positive returns since the Fund's launch.

Toward the end of the reporting period, the Fund also initiated positions in
select investment grade foreign government bonds, providing further
diversification for the Fund.

Following its August 2003 launch, the Fund distributed its first monthly
dividend and issued $190 million of preferred stock in November 2003. Proceeds
from the preferred stock issuance were invested in fixed income sectors
consistent with our current investment strategy. We thank you for your continued
participation in

Dividend Reinvestment Plan


The Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan") offers you a prompt and
simple way to reinvest dividends and capital gain distributions
("Distributions") in shares of the Fund. PFPC, Inc. (the "Agent"), P.O. Box
43027, Providence, RI 02940-3027, will act as your Agent in administering the
Plan. The Agent will open an account for you under the Plan in the same name as
your outstanding shares are registered. The complete Terms and Conditions of the
Dividend Reinvestment Plan are contained in the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment
Plan Brochure. A copy of that Brochure may be obtained from the Fund at the
address on the back cover of this report.

You are automatically enrolled in the Plan unless you elect to receive
Distributions in cash. If you own shares in your own name, you should notify the
Agent, in writing, if you wish to receive Distributions in cash.

If the Fund declares a Distribution, you, as a participant in the Plan, will
automatically receive an equivalent amount of shares of the Fund purchased on
your behalf by the Agent.

If on the payment date for a Distribution, the net asset value per share is
equal to or less than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage
commissions, the Agent shall receive newly issued shares, including fractions,
from the Fund for your account. The number of additional shares to be credited
shall be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Distribution by the
greater of the net asset value per share on the payment date, or 95% of the then
current market price per share.

If the net asset value per share exceeds the market price plus estimated
brokerage commissions on the payment date for a Distribution, the Agent (or a
broker-dealer selected by the Agent) shall try, for a purchase period of 30
days, to apply the amount of such Distribution on your shares (less your pro
rata share of brokerage commissions incurred) to purchase shares on the open
market. The weighted average price (including brokerage commissions) of all
shares it purchases shall be your allocated price per share. If, before the
Agent has completed its purchases, the market price plus estimated brokerage
commissions exceeds the net asset value of the shares as of the payment date,
the purchase price the Agent paid may exceed the net asset value of the shares,
resulting in the acquisition of fewer shares than if such Distribution had been
paid in shares issued by the Fund. Participants should note that they will not
be able to instruct the Agent to purchase shares at a specific time or at a
specific price. The Agent may make open-market purchases on any securities
exchange where shares are traded, in the over-the-counter market or in
negotiated transactions, and may be on such terms as to price, delivery and
otherwise as the Agent shall determine.






                                                               Annual Report | 7
<PAGE>
The market price of shares on a particular date shall be the last sales price on
the American stock exchange, or, if there is no sale on the exchange on that
date, then the mean between the closing bid and asked quotations on the exchange
on such date. The net asset value per share on a particular date shall be the
amount most recently calculated by or on behalf of the Fund as required by law.

The Agent shall at all times act in good faith and agree to use its best efforts
within reasonable limits to ensure the accuracy of all services performed under
this agreement and to comply with applicable law, but assumes no responsibility
and shall not be liable for loss or damage due to errors unless such error is
caused by the Agent's negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or that of
its employees. Your uninvested funds held by the Agent will not bear interest.
The Agent shall have no responsibility for the value of shares acquired. For the
purpose of cash investments, the Agent may commingle your funds with those of
other participants of the same Fund.

There is no direct charge to participants for reinvesting Distributions, since
the Agent's fees are paid by the Fund. However, when shares are purchased in the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of any brokerage
commissions incurred. If you elect by notice to the Agent to have it sell part
or all of your shares and remit the proceeds, the Agent will deduct brokerage
commissions from the proceeds.

The automatic reinvestment of Distributions does not relieve you of any taxes
that may be payable on Distributions. In connection with the reinvestment of
Distributions, shareholders generally will be treated as having received a
Distribution equal to the cash Distribution that would have been paid.

The Agent will forward to you any proxy solicitation material and will vote any
shares so held for you first in accordance with the instructions set forth on
proxies you return to the Fund, and then with respect to any proxies you do not
return to the Fund in the same portion as the Agent votes proxies the
participants return to the Fund.






8 | Annual Report
<PAGE>

As long as you participate in the Plan, the Agent will hold the shares it has
acquired for you in safekeeping, in its name or in the name of its nominee. This
convenience provides added protection against loss, theft or inadvertent
destruction of certificates. However, you may request that a certificate
representing your Plan shares be issued to you. Upon your written request, the
Agent will deliver to you, without charge, a certificate or certificates for the
full shares. The Agent will send you a confirmation of each acquisition made for
your account as soon as practicable, but not later than 60 days after the
acquisition date. Although from time to time you may have an undivided
fractional interest in a share of the Fund, no certificates for a fractional
share will be issued. Distributions on fractional shares will be credited to
your account. If you terminate your account under the Plan, the Agent will
adjust for any such undivided fractional interest in cash at the market value of
shares at the time of termination.

You may withdraw from the Plan at any time, without penalty, by notifying the

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Franklin Templeton Limited Duration Income Trust (the Fund) is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, closed-end investment
company. The Fund seeks high current income. The following summarizes the Fund's
significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Securities listed or traded on a recognized national exchange are valued at the
last reported sales price. Securities listed or traded on NASDAQ are valued at
their official closing price. Over-the-counter securities and listed securities
for which no sale is reported are valued within the range of the latest quoted
bid and asked prices. Debt securities are valued by independent pricing services
or market makers under procedures approved by the Board of Trustees. Foreign
securities are valued at the close of trading of the foreign exchange or the
NYSE, whichever is earlier. If events occur that materially affect the values of
securities after the prices or foreign exchange rates are determined but prior
to 4:00 PM ET or the close of trading on the NYSE, whichever is earlier, or if
market quotations are deemed not readily available or reliable, the securities
will be valued at fair value as determined following procedures approved by the
Board of Trustees. Investments in open-end mutual funds are valued at the
closing net asset value.

The Fund invests in senior secured corporate loans and senior secured debt that
meet credit standards established by Franklin Advisers Inc. The Fund values such
securities based on quotations provided by banks, broker/dealers or pricing
services experienced in such matters.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities and income items denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date.

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

C. SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED, DELAYED DELIVERY, OR TBA BASIS

The Fund may purchase securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery, or
to-be-announced (TBA) basis, with payment and delivery scheduled for a future
date. These transactions are subject to market fluctuations and are subject to
the risk that the value at delivery may be more or less than the trade date
purchase price. Although the Fund will generally purchase these securities with
the intention of holding the securities, it may sell the securities before the
settlement date.

D. MORTGAGE DOLLAR ROLLS

The Fund enters into mortgage dollar rolls, typically on a TBA basis. Dollar
rolls are agreements between the Fund and a financial institution to
simultaneously sell and repurchase a mortgage-backed security at a future date.
Gains or losses are realized at the time of the sale and the difference between
the repurchase price and sale price is recorded as an unrealized gain to the
Fund. The risks of mortgage dollar roll transactions include the potential
inability of the counterparty to fulfill their obligations.

E. SENIOR FLOATING RATE INTERESTS

Senior secured corporate loans pay interest at rates which are periodically
reset by reference to a base lending rate plus a spread. These base lending
rates are generally the prime rate offered by a designated U.S. bank or the
London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

F. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for income taxes because the Fund's policy is to
qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute substantially all of its taxable income.

G. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Discounts and premiums
on securities purchased are amortized over the lives of the respective
securities. Facility fees are recognized as income over the expected term of the
loan. Dividend income and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the
ex-dividend date.

H. OFFERING COSTS

Offering costs are charged to paid-in-capital upon the sale of Fund shares.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

I. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

J. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is
unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.


2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

On August 27, 2003, the Fund completed its initial public offering. On September
25, 2003 and October 14, 2003, the Fund issued additional shares in connection
with the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment allocation option. Shares
were issued at $15.00 per share before the underwriters' discount of $0.675 per
share. The Fund's investment manager agreed in advance to assume as its own
expense all offering and organizational expenses in excess of $.03 per share,
excluding the underwriters' discount.

Transactions in the Fund's common shares were as follows:

3. AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES

On November 7, 2003, the Fund issued 2,534 Preferred Shares Series M, 2,533
Preferred Shares Series W and 2,533 Preferred Shares Series F, each with a
$25,000 liquidation preference per share, totaling $190,000,000. Dividends to
preferred shareholders are cumulative and are declared weekly, at rates
established through an auction process. During the period ended March 31, 2004,
the dividends on Preferred Shares ranged from 1.02% to 1.70%.

The Fund is required to maintain on a weekly basis a specified discounted value
of its portfolio in compliance with guidelines established by Fitch Ratings and
Moody's Investor Services Inc., and is required to maintain asset coverage for
the Preferred Shares of at least 200%.

The Preferred Shares are redeemable by the Fund at any time and are subject to
mandatory redemption if the asset coverage or discounted value requirements are
not met. During the period ended March 31, 2004, all requirements were met.

Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) ..............  $ 14,151,525

the year ending March 31, 2005.

Net investment income (loss) differs for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, mortgage
dollar rolls, paydown losses, and bond discount and premiums.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, mortgage dollar rolls, paydown losses, and bond discount and
premiums.


7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of securities (excluding short-term securities) for the
period ended March 31, 2004 aggregated $742,060,413 and $186,393,987,
respectively.


8. INVESTMENTS IN THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

Portfolio (the Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by
Advisers. Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the
Sweep Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management fees paid by the
Sweep Money Fund. The Fund earned $124,997 of dividend income from investment in
the Sweep Money Fund for the period ended March 31, 2004.

9. CREDIT RISK AND DEFAULTED SECURITIES

The Fund has 64.65% of its portfolio invested in below investment grade and
comparable quality unrated high yield securities, which tend to be more
sensitive to economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss
due to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders of
high yielding securities because such securities may be unsecured and
subordinated to other creditors of the issuer.

The Fund held defaulted securities and/or securities for which income has been
deemed uncollectible. The Fund discontinues accruing income on these securities
and provides an estimate for losses on interest receivable. At March 31, 2004,
the value of these securities was $3,180,000, representing .81% of the Fund's
net assets applicable to common shares. For information as to specific
securities, see the accompanying Statement of Investments.


10. REGULATORY MATTERS

MASSACHUSETTS ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING

On February 4, 2004, the Securities Division of the Office of the Secretary of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an administrative complaint against
Franklin Resources, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (the "Company")
claiming violations of the Massachusetts Uniform Securities Act ("Massachusetts
Act") with respect to an alleged arrangement to permit market timing (the "Mass.
Proceeding"). On February 14, 2004, the Company filed an answer denying all
violations of the Massachusetts Act.

GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS

As part of ongoing investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC), the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California, the New York
Attorney General, the California Attorney General, the U.S. Attorney for the
District of Massachusetts, the Florida Department of Financial Services and the
Commissioner of Securities, the West Virginia Attorney General and the Vermont
Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities, and Health Care Administration,
relating to certain practices in the mutual fund industry, including late
trading, market timing and payments to securities dealers who sell fund shares,
the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current or former
executives and employees of the Company, have received requests for information
and/or subpoenas to testify or produce documents. The Company and its current
employees are providing documents and information in response to these requests
and subpoenas. In addition, the Company has responded to requests for similar
kinds of information from regulatory authorities in some of the foreign
countries where the Company conducts its global asset management business.

10. REGULATORY MATTERS (CONTINUED)

GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

The staff of the SEC has informed the Company that it intends to recommend that
the SEC authorize a civil injunctive action against the Fund's investment
manager. The SEC's investigation is focused on the activities that are the
subject of the Mass. Proceeding described above and other instances of alleged
market timing by a limited number of third parties that ended in 2000. The
Company currently believes that the charges the SEC staff is contemplating are
unwarranted. There are discussions underway with the SEC staff in an effort to
resolve the issues raised in their investigation.

In response to requests for information and subpoenas from the SEC and the
California Attorney General, the Company has provided documents and testimony
has been taken relating to payments to security dealers who sell fund shares.
Effective November 28, 2003, the Company determined not to direct any further
brokerage commissions where the allocation is based, not only on best execution,
but also on the sale of Fund shares.

OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company, in addition to other entities within Franklin Templeton
Investments, including certain of its subsidiaries, other funds, and current and
former officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits
in different federal courts in Nevada, California, Illinois, New York, New
Jersey, and Florida, alleging violations of various federal securities laws and
seeking, among other things, monetary damages and costs. Specifically, the
lawsuits claim breach of duty with respect to alleged arrangements to permit
market timing and/or late trading activity, or breach of duty with respect to
the valuation of the portfolio securities of certain funds managed by Company
subsidiaries, resulting in alleged market timing activity. The majority of these
lawsuits duplicate, in whole or in part, the allegations asserted in the Mass.
Proceeding detailed above. The lawsuits are styled as class actions or
derivative actions.

In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries, as well as certain current and
former officers, employees, and directors have been named in multiple lawsuits
alleging violations of various securities laws and pendent state law claims
relating to the disclosure of directed brokerage payments and payment of
allegedly excessive commissions and advisory fees. These lawsuits are styled as
class actions and derivative actions.

Management strongly believes that the claims made in each of these lawsuits are
without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them.

The Company cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of the foregoing
Mass. Proceeding, other governmental investigations or class actions or other
lawsuits. The impact, if any, of these matters on the Fund is uncertain at this
time. If the Company determines that it bears responsibility for any unlawful or
inappropriate conduct that caused losses to the Fund, it is committed to making
the Fund or its shareholders whole, as appropriate.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FRANKLIN TEMPLETON LIMITED
DURATION INCOME TRUST

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Franklin Templeton Limited Duration
Income Trust (the "Fund") at March 31, 2004, and the results of its operations,
the changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for the period August
27, 2003 (commencement of operations) through March 31, 2004, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audit. We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit, which included
confirmation of securities at March 31, 2004 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers, provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.  N/A

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Trust has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Mutual Advisers, Inc., in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to Institutional
Shareholder Services (ISS), an unaffiliated third party corporate governance
research service that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas,
vote recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition,
the manager subscribes to Glass Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although ISS' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from ISS, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. The manager votes proxies
solely in the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. As a matter of policy,
the officers, directors, trustees and employees of the Fund, the manager and the
Proxy Group will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict
with the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. All conflicts are resolved
in the interests of the manager's clients. In situations where the manager
perceives a material conflict of interest, the manager may: disclose the
conflict to the Fund's board of trustees; defer to the voting recommendation of
the Fund's board of trustees, ISS, Glass Lewis or those of another independent
third party provider of proxy services; or take such other action in good faith
(in consultation with counsel) which would protect the interests of the Fund and
its shareholders.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor which the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted, but is not determinative
of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with
respect to most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS. In light of several high profile accounting scandals,
the manager will closely scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a
case-by-case basis, the manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit
relationships and non-audit fees. The manager will also consider, on a
case-by-case basis, proposals to rotate auditors, and will vote against the
ratification of auditors when there is clear and compelling evidence of
accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT & DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with its shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis by considering several factors to
determine whether the plan is fair and reasonable, including the ISS
quantitative model utilized to assess such plans and/or the Glass Lewis
evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally oppose plans that have the
potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost always oppose plans that
are structured to allow the repricing of underwater options, or plans that have
an automatic share replenishment "evergreen" feature. The manager will generally
support employee stock option plans in which the purchase price is at least 85%
of fair market value, and when potential dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as they align their interests with those of shareholders. The manager
will review on a case-by-case basis any shareholder proposals to adopt policies
on expensing stock option plans.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. On
occasion, the manager may vote with management when the research analyst has
concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would not harm the Fund or its
shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports proposals that require
shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject to a shareholder vote
and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether or not they warrant support. The manager will generally vote against any
proposal to issue stock that has unequal or subordinate voting rights. The
manager generally opposes any supermajority voting requirements as well as the
payment of "greenmail." The manager generally supports "fair price" provisions
and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase and proposals seeking preemptive rights. The manager will generally not
vote in favor of dual-class capital structures to increase the number of
authorized shares where that class of stock would have superior voting rights.
The manager will generally vote in favor of the issuance of preferred stock in
cases where the company specifies the voting, dividend, conversion and other
rights of such stock and the terms of the preferred stock issuance are deemed
reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether each will be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring and reincorporation proposals are also subject to a
thorough examination on a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
proxy voting decisions for international companies. However, the manager must be
more flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied market
practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign proxies. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. The manager may abstain from voting
under certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when
the manager is not given adequate information from the company.

Shareholders may view the complete Policies on-line at franklintempleton.com.
Alternatively, shareholders may request copies of the Policies free of charge by
calling the Proxy Group collect at 1-954-847-2268 or by sending a written
request to: Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC, 500 East Broward Boulevard, Suite
1500, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33394, Attention: Proxy Group. Copies of the Fund's
proxy voting records will also be made available on-line at
franklintempleton.com and posted on the SEC website at WWW.SEC.GOV no later than
August 31, 2004 and will reflect the twelve-month period beginning July 1, 2003,
and ending June 30, 2004.

AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS N/A

9. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS. There have been no
changes to the procedures by which shareholders may recommend nominees to the
Registrant's Board of Trustees that would require disclosure herein.

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
(a) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. The Registrant maintains
disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in the Registrant's filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and
forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such information is accumulated
and communicated to the Registrant's management, including its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Registrant's management,
including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer,
recognizes that any set of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed
and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired
control objectives.

Within 90 days prior to the filing date of this Shareholder Report on Form
N-CSR, the Registrant had carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and
with the participation of the Registrant's management, including the
Registrant's principal executive officer and the Registrant's principal
financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the
Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the
Registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures are
effective.

(B) CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS. There have been no significant changes in the
Registrant's internal controls or in other factors that could significantly
affect the internal controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in
connection with the preparation of this Shareholder Report on Form N-CSR.

ITEM 11. EXHIBITS.

                                                                EXHIBIT (A)

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                  CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS AND PURPOSE OF THE CODE
      This code of ethics (the "Code")1 is for the investment companies within
the complex registered with the United States Securities & Exchange Commission
("SEC") (collectively, "FT Funds") applies to each FT Fund's Principal Executive
Officers, Principal Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer (the
"Covered Officers" each of whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

o     Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
      apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
      relationships;

o     Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
      documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
      other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

o     Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o     The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
      appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

o     Accountability for adherence to the Code.

      Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics
and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

II.   COVERED OFFICERS SHOULD HANDLE ETHICALLY ACTUAL AND APPARENT CONFLICTS OF
      INTEREST OVERVIEW. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered
      Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or his
service to, the FT Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the FT Funds.

      Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between
Covered Officers and the FT Funds and already are subject to conflict of
interest provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company
Act") and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment Advisers Act"). For
example, Covered Officers may not individually engage in certain transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated persons" of the FT Funds. The FT Funds'
and the investment advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these programs and procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

      Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal
benefit, conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship
between the FT Funds, the investment advisers and the fund administrator of
which the Covered Officers are also officers or employees. As a result, this
Code recognizes that the Covered Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser, the administrator,
or for all three), be involved in establishing policies and implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is
inherent in the contractual relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds. Thus, if performed in conformity
with the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is recognized by the FT Funds' Boards of Directors ("Boards") that the
Covered Officers may also be officers or employees of one or more other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

      Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such
conflicts of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of
conflicts of interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind
that these examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the
personal interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before
the interest of the FT Funds.
Each Covered Officer must:

o     Not use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to
      influence investment decisions or financial reporting by the FT Funds
      whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of
      the FT Funds;

o     Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take action, for the
      individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit
      the FT Funds;

o     Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the
      Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that
      are made in good faith;

o     Report  at  least   annually   the   following   affiliations   or  other
      relationships:/2

o     all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
      required to file reports with the SEC;
o     any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent
      directors;

o     any direct or indirect business relationship with any independent public
      accounting firm; and

o     any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
      that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
      the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
      affiliates of Franklin Resources).

   There are some conflict of interest situations that should always be
approved in writing by FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel, if
material. Examples of these include/3:

  o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

  o The receipt of any gifts in excess of $100;

  o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT
    Funds has current or prospective business dealings unless such
    entertainment is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to
    time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of
    impropriety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must
    obtain prior approval for any entertainment with a value in excess of
    $1000.

  o Any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
    with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
    adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
    thereof;

  o A direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
    charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for effecting portfolio
    transactions or for selling or redeeming shares other than an interest
    arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation or
    equity ownership.

    FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a report to
the FT Funds Audit Committee of any approvals granted at the next regularly
scheduled meeting.

III.  DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

o     Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
      requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

o     Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
      misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
      outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
      and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

o     Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
      responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the FT Funds,
      the adviser and the administrator with the goal of promoting full, fair,
      accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and
      documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other
      public communications made by the FT Funds; and

o     It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
      with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
      regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY
 Each Covered Officer must:

o     Upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
      Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received,
      read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);
o     Annually thereafter affirm to the Board that he has complied with the
      requirements of the Code; and

o     Notify FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel promptly if he knows
      of any violation of this Code. Failure to do so is itself is a violation
      of this Code.

      FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are responsible for
applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are presented under
it and have the authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation.4
However, the Independent Directors of the respective fund will consider any
approvals or waivers5 sought by any Chief Executive Officers of the Funds.

      The FT Funds will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing
this Code:

o     FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take all appropriate
      action to investigate any potential violations reported to him;
o     If, after such investigation, FT's General Counsel or Deputy General
      Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, FT's General Counsel is
      not required to take any further action;
o     Any matter that FT's General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
      a violation will be reported to the Independent Directors of the
      appropriate FT Fund;
o     If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it will
      inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate Funds,
      which will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
      appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
      notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
      board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;
o     The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting waivers, as
      appropriate; and
o     Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
      disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V.    OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
      This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies there under. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-l under the Investment Company Act and more
detailed policies and procedures set forth in FT's Employee Handbook are
separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are not
part of this Code.

VI.   AMENDMENTS
      Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved or ratified by a majority vote of the FT Funds' Board including a
majority of independent directors.

VII.  CONFIDENTIALITY
      All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code will
be considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or this Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE
      The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the FT Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any FT Funds, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

TO:   FT GENERAL COUNSEL, LEGAL DEPARTMENT
I hereby acknowledge receipt of a copy of Franklin Templeton Fund's code of
ethics for Principal Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers (the
"Code") that I have read and understand. I will comply fully with all provisions
of the Code to the extent they apply to me during the period of my employment. I
further understand and acknowledge that any violation of the Code may subject me
to disciplinary action, including termination of employment

                Signature                           Date signed

1 Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has adopted a code of ethics that applies to the registrant's principal
executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party. If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so. The
registrant must also: (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an exhibit to
its annual report;
(2) post the text of the code on its Internet website and
disclose, in its most recent report on Form N-CSR, its Internet address and the
fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or
(3) undertake in its most recent report on Form N-CSR to provide to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in
which such request may be made. Disclosure is also required of amendments to,
or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a provision of the code in the
registrant's annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website. If the registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such information on its website, it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

2 Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships may be made separately
by completing the Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning to FT's
General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel. 3 Any activity or relationship that
would present a conflict for a Covered
  Officer would likely also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a
  member of the Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity
  or has such a relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written
  approval by FT's General Counsel in such situations.

4 FT's General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized to consult, as
appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the FT Funds and
counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so. 5 Item 2 of
Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of
  a material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
  waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
  action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from
  a provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
  officer" of the registrant.

4. The  registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s)  and I are  responsible  for

registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

information;  and  (b)  Any  fraud,  whether  or  not  material,  that  involves
management or other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
internal control over financial reporting.
