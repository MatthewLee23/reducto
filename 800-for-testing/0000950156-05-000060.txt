LETTER FROM THE CEO
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Shareholders,

[Photo of Robert J. Manning]

For most investors, the main factor in determining long-term success is asset
allocation - how they spread their money among stocks, bonds, and cash. In
fact, the total returns of investors may be more influenced by their asset
allocation strategy than by their security selection within each asset class.
The principle behind asset allocation is simple: by diversifying across a
variety of types of securities, investors reduce the overall risk of their
portfolio because gains in one area are likely to offset losses in another.

One of the dangers of not having an asset allocation plan is the temptation to
simply chase performance, by moving money into whichever asset class appears
to be outperforming at the moment. The problem with this approach is that by
the time a particular area of the market comes into favor, investors may have
already missed some of the best performance. We would suggest that one way to
benefit from swings in the market is to acquire a diversified portfolio so
that investors hold a range of asset classes before the market swings in their
direction.

UNDERSTAND YOUR EMOTIONS

It usually takes a bear market for people to appreciate the benefits of
diversification. At MFS, we believe proper asset allocation is important in
all market environments. But we understand that there are emotional components
of investment decisions that sometimes keep investors from achieving their
long term goals. The three common behaviors that negatively impact investment
decisions are overconfidence, looking backwards, and loss aversion.

  o Overconfidence. After experiencing gains in the market, particularly during
    a bull market, investors have a natural tendency to overestimate their own
    abilities. During the global bull market of the late 1990s, for example, a
    large number of investors traded their own stocks and made significant
    profits. However, most of these same investors later handed back those
    profits - and then some - because they focused more on short-term blips in
    the market and less on the fundamental factors that affect a company's
    long-term prospects.

  o Looking backwards. Although security prices are determined by expectations
    about the future, many investors make choices based on the recent past.
    Investors who have achieved momentary success in the market tend to take on
    too much risk, believing that better- than-average returns can be easily
    duplicated. On the other hand, those who have had negative experiences tend
    to become overly cautious and take on too little risk. Recent historical
    experience tends to dictate an investor's frame of reference and may lead to
    irrational decisions.

  o Loss aversion. Simply put, investors would rather avoid the immediate pain
    of losses than enjoy the future pleasure of gains. As a result, some
    investors tend to overreact to short-term downturns in the market by seeking
    to mitigate their losses, rather than remaining invested to benefit from the
    long-term growth potential of the stock and bond markets.

THINK LIKE A PROFESSIONAL INVESTOR

Asset allocation helps reduce the emotional factors that tend to affect the
long-term returns of investors. Professional investors - those who manage
assets for money management firms, pension funds, and endowments - have tended
to outperform the average retirement investor because they focus on asset
allocation. For example, the investment performance of the average 401(k)
participant has lagged these professional investors by more than two
percentage points a year, on average, over the past 10 years.(1)

We think asset allocation is one of the most important decisions for
investors. A study of the performance of 91 large U.S. corporate pension plans
with assets of more than $100 million over a 10-year period beginning in 1974
concluded that asset allocation policies accounted for 93.6% of their returns,
while individual security selection and the timing of their investments
accounted for only 6.4% for their overall performance.(2)

Professional investors target a realistic level of return based on the amount
of risk they are willing to take, then set allocations to meet their goals. On
average, U.S. professional investors allocate 35% to 40% of their assets to
domestic equity stocks; 20% to 30% to fixed income issues; 10% to
international stocks; and between 10% and 20% to other investment classes such
as real estate.(3) And within those categories, they hold a broad range of
styles and asset classes.

In contrast, 401(k) participants who held company stock in their retirement
plans at the end of 2002 had roughly 42% of their retirement assets in company
stock while the rest was allocated to either growth or value stock funds.(4)
These participants virtually ignored the broad range of equity, fixed-income,
and international offerings provided by their retirement plans.

ALLOCATE, DIVERSIFY, REBALANCE

We recommend working with a professional adviser to find an optimal mix of
investments based on your individual goals. In our view, a disciplined asset
allocation strategy is composed of three simple steps: allocate, diversify
and rebalance.

  o Allocate. Investors should work with their financial adviser to specify
    their long-term goals and tolerance for risk. Then investors should allocate
    their assets across the major asset classes - stocks, bonds, and cash - to
    help them pursue an investment return that is consistent with their risk
    tolerance level.

  o Diversify. By diversifying their assets, investors trade some performance in
    the top performing categories for a more predictable and stable portfolio.
    At the same time, investors should include different investment styles and
    market capitalizations of stocks and a range of fixed-income investments, as
    well as U.S. and non-U.S. securities. Because security subclasses tend to
    move in and out of favor during various market and economic environments, a
    broad portfolio increases the benefits of diversification.

  o Rebalance. We suggest that investors consult with their professional
    advisers periodically to rebalance their portfolios to maintain the
    percentages that they have dedicated to each asset class. Allocations can
    shift as markets rise and fall, making for a riskier or more conservative
    portfolio than an investor originally intended. For example, a portfolio of
    50% stocks and 50% bonds at the start of 2000 would have shifted to 32%
    stocks and 68% bonds at the end of 2002 because of the weak stock market.(5)

In short, these three simple concepts - allocate, diversify and rebalance -
help take emotion out of the investment process and help prevent investors
from trying to outguess the market. An asset allocation strategy cannot turn a
down market cycle into a good one, but it is an invaluable tool to manage risk
and keep investors on track toward reaching their long-term investment goals.

A DISCIPLINED INVESTMENT PROCESS IS PARAMOUNT

Disciplined diversification has helped investors pursue long-term, above-
average results through the years. Since 1924, when we invented the mutual
fund, MFS(R) has strived to give investors the products and tools they need to
maintain well-diversified portfolios. MFS provides a variety of products in
each asset class as well as a family of asset allocation funds. These asset
allocation portfolios cover a range from conservative to moderate, growth, and
aggressive growth allocations, each with a strategy based on a distinct level
of risk. We recommend developing a comprehensive financial plan with an
investment advisor who is familiar with your risk tolerance, your individual
goals, and your financial situation.

As always, we appreciate your confidence in MFS and welcome any questions or
comments you may have.

    Respectfully,

/s/ Robert J. Manning

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY OF RESULTS

For the one year ended November 30, 2004, the MFS Government Markets Income
Trust returned 4.86%, at net asset value (NAV), while the benchmark, the
Lehman Brothers Government/Mortgage Index, returned 4.27%. At market (NYSE
price), the trust returned 2.49%. The trust seeks to provide a high level of
current income by investing at least 80% of its net assets in U.S. and non-
U.S. government securities.

MARKET ENVIRONMENT

In 2004, many measures of global economic growth, including employment and
corporate spending, continued to improve, although we feel that record-high oil
prices, concerns about rising interest rates, and a turbulent geopolitical
environment affected global markets. The U.S. Federal Reserve Board raised
interest rates four times during the period, and in our view, set expectations
for an ongoing series of modest rate hikes. During the reporting period, the
U.S. dollar fell significantly against the euro and other major currencies.
This trend would have a negative impact on the relative performance of any fund
which was overweight in dollar denominated assets versus its benchmark.
Alternatively, it would help funds which were underweight.

CONTRIBUTORS TO PERFORMANCE

The trust benefited somewhat from our currency exposure to the euro, as well as
some other foreign currencies. This exposure came primarily from general
exposure to international bonds domiciled in Euro-area countries and elsewhere.
Our selection of issues within the sovereign and agency sectors also
contributed. Among North American holdings, our sector positioning in agencies
and TIPS proved positive to relative performance. Our overall duration and
yield curve positioning also made a slight contribution. Duration is a measure
of the portfolio's sensitivity to interest rates.

DETRACTORS FROM PERFORMANCE

On the negative side, holding lower yielding issues than the benchmark
detracted from relative performance. This was particularly true among our U.S.
holdings. Our positioning in the mortgage sector also detracted. At the issue
level, some mortgage securities in the trust were disappointing.

INDEX DEFINITIONS

Lehman Brothers Government/Mortgage Index - measures the performance of the
government and mortgage securities markets.

Citigroup World Government Bond Non-dollar Hedged Index - measures the
government bond markets around the world, ex-U.S.

Note to Shareholders: Effective June 30, 2004, we no longer use the Citigroup
World Government Bond Non-dollar Hedged Index.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

NOTES TO PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

The trust's shares may trade at a discount to net asset value. Shareholders do
not have the right to cause the trust to repurchase their shares at net asset
value. The trust's shares also may trade at a premium to their net asset value.
When trust shares trade at a premium, buyers pay more than the asset value of
the underlying trust shares, and shares purchased at a premium would receive
less than the amount paid for them in the event of the trust's liquidation. As
a result, the total return that is calculated based on the net asset value and
New York Stock Exchange price can be different.

The trust's monthly distributions may include a return of capital to
shareholders. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes as
a return of capital will reduce each shareholder's basis in his or her shares
and, to the extent the return of capital exceeds such basis, will be treated as
gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Returns of shareholder capital
have the effect of reducing the trust's assets and increasing the trust's
expense ratio.

KEY RISK CONSIDERATIONS

The portfolio may invest in derivative securities, which may include futures
and options. These types of instruments can increase price fluctuation.

The portfolio may invest in foreign and/or emerging markets securities, which
are more susceptible to interest rates, currency exchange rate, economic, and
political risks.

The portfolio invests in government-guaranteed securities. These guarantees
apply to the underlying securities only and not to the prices and yields of the
portfolio.

The portfolio may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in one or
more issuers, therefore making the portfolio more susceptible to any single
economic, political or regulatory occurrence.

The portfolio's value will fluctuate in response to market conditions and
issuer, regulatory, economic or political developments. In general, fixed
income securities will decline when interest rates rise and will increase when
interest rates fall. Many fixed income securities also involve credit risk,
which is the risk that issuers may fail to make timely principal or interest
payments. In addition, fixed income securities with longer maturity dates will
be subject to greater price fluctuations than those with shorter maturity
periods. These risks should be considered prior to investing.


In accordance with Section 23(c) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the
Trust hereby gives notice that it may from time to time repurchase shares of
the trust in the open market at the option of the Board of Trustees and on
such terms as the Trustees shall determine.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trust offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan that allows you
to reinvest either all of the distributions paid by the trust or only the
long-term capital gains. Purchases are made at the market price unless that
price exceeds the net asset value (the shares are trading at a premium). If the
shares are trading at a premium, purchases will be made at a discounted price
of either the net asset value or 95% of the market price, whichever is greater.
Twice each year you can also buy shares. Investments may be made in any amount
over $100 in January and July on the 15th of the month or shortly thereafter.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the plan, you may wish to request that your shares be
re-registered in your own name so that you can participate.

There is no service charge to reinvest distributions, nor are there brokerage
charges for shares issued directly by the trust. However, when shares are
bought on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the open market, each
participant pays a pro rata share of the commissions. The automatic
reinvestment of distributions does not relieve you of any income tax that may
be payable (or required to be withheld) on the distributions.

To enroll in or withdraw from the plan, or if you have any questions, call
1-800-637-2304 any business day from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time. Please have
available the name of the trust and your account and Social Security numbers.
For certain types of registrations, such as corporate accounts, instructions
must be submitted in writing. Please call for additional details. When you
withdraw from the plan, you can receive the value of the reinvested shares in
one of two ways: a check for the value of the full and fractional shares, or a
certificate for the full shares and a check for the fractional shares.

(S) Effective June 7, 2004, the investment adviser has voluntarily agreed to reimburse the trust for its proportional share
    of Independent Chief Compliance Officer services paid to Tarantino LLC. If this fee had been incurred by the trust, the

(S)(S) As required, effective December 1, 2001, the trust has adopted the provisions of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide
       for Investment Companies and began amortizing premium on debt securities. The effect of this change for the year ended
       November 30, 2002 was to decrease net investment income per share by $0.02, increase net realized and unrealized gains
       and losses per share by $0.02, and decrease the ratio of net investment income to average net assets by 0.33%. Per
       share, ratios, and supplemental data for periods prior to December 1, 2001 have not been restated to reflect this
       change in presentation.

statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The trust
can invest in foreign securities. Investments in foreign securities are
vulnerable to the effects of changes in the relative values of the local
currency and the U.S. dollar and to the effects of changes in each country's
legal, political, and economic environment.

INVESTMENT VALUATIONS - Bonds and other fixed income securities (other than
short-term obligations) in the trust's portfolio are valued at an evaluated bid
price as reported by an independent pricing service, or to the extent a
valuation is not reported by a pricing service, such securities are valued on
the basis of quotes from brokers and dealers. Prices obtained from pricing
services utilize both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing
techniques which take into account appropriate factors such as
institutional-size trading in similar groups of securities, yield, quality,
coupon rate, maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other market
data without exclusive reliance upon quoted prices or exchange or over-the-
counter prices, since such valuations are believed to reflect more accurately
the fair value of such securities. Futures contracts are valued at the
settlement price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary
exchange on which they are traded. Forward foreign currency contracts are
valued using spot rates and forward points as reported by an independent
pricing source. Short-term obligations with a remaining maturity in excess of
60 days will be valued upon dealer-supplied valuations. All other short-term
obligations in the trust's portfolio are valued at amortized cost, which
constitutes market value as determined by the Board of Trustees. Money market
mutual funds are valued at net asset value. Investment valuations, other
assets, and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are converted
each business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. When
pricing service information or market quotations are not readily available,
securities are priced at fair value as determined under the direction of the
Board of Trustees.

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS - The trust may enter into repurchase agreements with
institutions that the trust's investment adviser has determined are
creditworthy. Each repurchase agreement is recorded at cost. The trust requires
that the securities collateral in a repurchase transaction be transferred to
the custodian in a manner sufficient to enable the trust to obtain those
securities in the event of a default under the repurchase agreement. The trust
monitors, on a daily basis, the value of the collateral to ensure that its
value, including accrued interest, is greater than amounts owed to the trust
under each such repurchase agreement. The trust, along with other affiliated
entities of Massachusetts Financial Services Company (MFS), may utilize a joint
trading account for the purpose of entering into one or more repurchase
agreements.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Purchases and sales of foreign investments,
income, and expenses are converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency
exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such transactions. Gains
and losses attributable to foreign currency exchange rates on sales of
securities are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains
and losses on investments. Gains and losses attributable to foreign exchange
rate movements on income and expenses are recorded for financial statement
purposes as foreign currency transaction gains and losses. That portion of both
realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.

FUTURES CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into futures contracts for the delayed
delivery of securities or currency, or contracts based on financial indices at
a fixed price on a future date. In entering such contracts, the trust is
required to deposit with the broker, either in cash or securities, an amount
equal to a certain percentage of the contract amount. Subsequent payments are
made or received by the trust each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in
the value of the contract, and are recorded for financial statement purposes as
unrealized gains or losses by the trust. The trust's investment in futures
contracts is designed to hedge against anticipated future changes in interest
or exchange rates or securities prices. Investments in interest rate futures
for purposes other than hedging may be made to modify the duration of the
portfolio without incurring the additional transaction costs involved in buying
and selling the underlying securities. Investments in currency futures for
purposes other than hedging may be made to change the trust's relative position
in one or more currencies without buying and selling portfolio assets.
Investments in equity index contracts or contracts on related options for
purposes other than hedging, may be made when the trust has cash on hand and
wishes to participate in anticipated market appreciation while the cash is
being invested. Should interest or exchange rates or securities prices move
unexpectedly, the trust may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the futures
contracts and may realize a loss.

SECURITY LOANS - State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), as
lending agent, may loan the securities of the trust to certain qualified
institutions (the "Borrowers") approved by the trust. The loans are
collateralized at all times by cash and/or U.S. Treasury securities in an
amount at least equal to the market value of the securities loaned. State
Street provides the trust with indemnification against Borrower default. The
trust bears the risk of loss with respect to the investment of cash collateral.
On loans collateralized by cash, the cash collateral is invested in a money
market fund or short-term securities. A portion of the income generated upon
investment of the collateral is remitted to the Borrowers, and the remainder is
allocated between the trust and the lending agent. On loans collateralized by
U.S. Treasury securities, a fee is received from the Borrower, and is allocated
between the trust and the lending agent. Income from securities lending is
included in interest income on the Statement of Operations. The dividend and
interest income earned on the securities loaned is accounted for in the same
manner as other dividend and interest income. At November 30, 2004, there were
no securities on loan.

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS - The trust may enter into forward
foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a specific
foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise upon
entering into these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties to
meet the terms of their contracts and from unanticipated movements in the value
of a foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The trust may enter into
forward foreign currency exchange contracts for hedging purposes as well as for
non-hedging purposes. For hedging purposes, the trust may enter into contracts
to deliver or receive foreign currency it will receive from or require for its
normal investment activities. The trust may also use contracts in a manner
intended to protect foreign currency-denominated securities from declines in
value due to unfavorable exchange rate movements. For non-hedging purposes, the
trust may enter into contracts with the intent of changing the relative
exposure of the trust's portfolio of securities to different currencies to take
advantage of anticipated changes. The forward foreign currency exchange
contracts are adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the underlying currency
and any gains or losses are recorded as unrealized until the contract
settlement date. On contract settlement date, the gains or losses are recorded
as realized gains or losses on foreign currency transactions.

DOLLAR ROLL TRANSACTIONS - The trust enters into dollar roll transactions, with
respect to mortgage backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and
Freddie Mac, in which the trust sells mortgage backed securities to financial
institutions and simultaneously agrees to accept substantially similar (same
type, coupon, and maturity) securities at a later date at an agreed-upon price.
During the period between the sale and repurchase in a dollar roll transaction
the trust will not be entitled to receive interest and principal payments on
the securities sold but is compensated by interest earned on the proceeds of
the initial sale and by a lower purchase price on the securities to be
repurchased which enhances the trust's total return. The trust accounts for
dollar roll transactions as purchases and sales. If certain criteria are met
these dollar roll transactions may be considered a financing transaction
whereby the difference in the sales price and the future purchase price is
recorded as an adjustment to interest income.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS AND INCOME - Investment transactions are recorded on
the trade date. Some securities may be purchased on a "when-issued" or "forward
delivery" basis, which means that the securities will be delivered to the trust
at a future date, usually beyond customary settlement time. Interest income is
recorded on the accrual basis. All premium and discount is amortized or
accreted for financial statement purposes in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. All discount is accreted for tax reporting
purposes as required by federal income tax regulations. Dividend and interest
payments received in additional securities are recorded on the ex-dividend or
ex-interest date in an amount equal to the value of the security on such date.

The trust may enter into "TBA" (to be announced) purchase commitments to
purchase securities for a fixed unit price at a future date. Although the unit
price has been established, the principal value has not been finalized.
However, the principal amount of the commitments will not fluctuate more than
0.01%. The trust holds, and maintains until settlement date, cash or high-
grade debt obligations in an amount sufficient to meet the purchase price, or
the trust may enter into offsetting contracts for the forward sale of other
securities it owns. Income on the securities will not be earned until
settlement date. TBA purchase commitments may be considered securities in
themselves, and involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be
purchased declines prior to settlement date, which is in addition to the risk
of decline in the value of the trust's other assets. Unsettled TBA purchase
commitments are valued at the current market value of the underlying
securities.

The trust may enter into "TBA" (to be announced) sale commitments to hedge its
portfolio positions or to sell mortgage-backed securities it owns under delayed
delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA sale commitments are not received until
the contractual settlement date. During the time a TBA sale commitment is
outstanding, equivalent deliverable securities, or an offsetting TBA purchase
commitment deliverable on or before the sale commitment date, are held as
"cover" for the transaction.

Legal fees and other related expenses incurred to preserve and protect the
value of a security owned are added to the cost of the security; other legal
fees are expensed. Capital infusions made directly to the security issuer,
which are generally non-recurring, incurred to protect or enhance the value of
high-yield debt securities, are reported as additions to the cost basis of the
security. Costs that are incurred to negotiate the terms or conditions of
capital infusions or that are expected to result in a plan of reorganization
are reported as realized losses. Ongoing costs incurred to protect or enhance
an investment, or costs incurred to pursue other claims or legal actions, are
expensed.

FEES PAID INDIRECTLY - The trust's custody fee is reduced according to an
arrangement that measures the value of cash deposited with the custodian by the
trust. This amount, for the year ended November 30, 2004, is shown as a
reduction of total expenses on the Statement of Operations.

TAX MATTERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS - The trust's policy is to comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) applicable to regulated
investment companies and to distribute to shareholders all of its net taxable
income, including any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no
provision for federal income or excise tax is provided.

Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The trust
distinguishes between distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting
basis and only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits are
reported in the financial statements as distributions from paid-in capital.
Differences in the recognition or classification of income between the
financial statements and tax earnings and profits, which result in temporary
over-distributions for financial statement purposes, are classified as
distributions in excess of net investment income or net realized gains. Common
types of book and tax differences that could occur include differences in
accounting for foreign currency transactions, amortization and accretion on
debt securities, straddle loss deferrals and wash sales.

The tax character of distributions declared for the years ended November 30,
2004 and November 30, 2003 was as follows:

                                                    11/30/04          11/30/03
Distributions declared from:
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordinary income                                  $17,946,379       $20,675,908
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During the year ended November 30, 2004, accumulated distributions in excess of
net investment income decreased by $1,425,228, accumulated net realized loss on
investments and foreign currency transactions increased by $2,241,559, and
paid-in capital increased by $816,331 due to differences between book and tax
accounting for foreign currency transactions and amortization and accretion on
debt securities. This change had no effect on the net assets or net asset value
per share.

As of November 30, 2004, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:

          Undistributed ordinary income                   $1,417,714
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Capital loss carryforward                      (28,360,010)

          Other temporary differences                     (3,680,424)
          ----------------------------------------------------------

For federal income tax purposes, the capital loss carryforward may be applied
against any net taxable realized gains of each succeeding year until the
earlier of its utilization or expiration as follows:

(3) TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

INVESTMENT ADVISER - The trust has an investment advisory agreement with MFS to
provide overall investment advisory and administrative services, and general
office facilities. The management fee is computed daily and paid monthly at an
annual rate of 0.32% of the trust's average daily net assets and 5.33% of the
trust's daily gross investment income. Management fees incurred for the year
ended November 30, 2004 were an effective rate of 0.60% of average daily net
assets on an annualized basis.

The trust pays compensation to its Independent Trustees in the form of a
retainer, attendance fees, and additional compensation to Board and Committee
chairpersons, and pays no compensation directly to its Trustees who are
officers of the investment adviser, or to officers of the trust, all of whom
receive remuneration for their services to the trust from MFS. Certain officers
and Trustees of the trust are officers or directors of MFS and MFS Service
Center, Inc. (MFSC). The trust has an unfunded, defined benefit plan for
retired Independent Trustees and an unfunded retirement benefit deferral plan
for current Independent Trustees. Included in Trustees' compensation is $3,910
as a result of the change in the trust's unfunded retirement benefit deferral
plan for certain current Independent Trustees and a pension expense of $14,200
for retired Independent Trustees for the year ended November 30, 2004.

This trust and certain other MFS funds (the "funds") have entered into a
services agreement (the "Agreement") which provides for payment of fees by the
funds to Tarantino LLC in return for the provision of services of an
Independent Chief Compliance Officer (ICCO) for the funds. The ICCO is an
officer of the funds and the sole member of Tarantino LLC. MFS has agreed to
reimburse each of the funds for a proportional share of substantially all of
the payments made by the funds to Tarantino LLC and also to provide office
space and other administrative support and supplies to the ICCO. The funds can
terminate the Agreement with Tarantino LLC at any time under the terms of the
Agreement.

ADMINISTRATOR - MFS provides certain financial, legal, shareholder
communications, compliance, and other administrative services to certain funds
for which MFS acts as investment adviser. Under an administrative services
agreement between the funds and MFS, MFS is entitled to partial reimbursement
of the costs MFS incurs to provide these services, subject to review and
approval by the Board of Trustees. Each fund is allocated a portion of these
administrative costs based on its size and relative average net assets. Prior
to April 1, 2004, the trust paid MFS an administrative fee up to the following
annual percentage rates of the trust's average daily net assets:

          First $2 billion                                    0.0175%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Next $2.5 billion                                   0.0130%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Next $2.5 billion                                   0.0005%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          In excess of $7 billion                             0.0000%
          ----------------------------------------------------------

Effective April 1, 2004, the trust paid MFS an administrative fee up to the
following annual percentage rates of the trust's average daily net assets:

          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Next $2.5 billion                                  0.00832%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          Next $2.5 billion                                  0.00032%
          ----------------------------------------------------------
          In excess of $7 billion                            0.00000%
          ----------------------------------------------------------

For the year ended November 30, 2004, the trust paid MFS $36,840, equivalent
to 0.0091% of average daily net assets, to partially reimburse MFS for the
costs of providing administrative services.

TRANSFER AGENT - Included in transfer agent and dividend disbursing costs is a
fee paid to MFSC, a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS, for its services as
registrar and dividend disbursing agent for the trust. The agreement provides
that the trust will pay MFSC an account maintenance fee of no more than $9.00
and a dividend services fee of $0.75 per reinvestment. These fees amounted to
$110,515 for the year ended November 30, 2004. Also included in transfer agent
and dividend disbursing costs are out-of-pocket expenses, paid to MFSC, which
amounted to $5,344 for the year ended November 30, 2004, as well as other
expenses paid to unaffiliated vendors.

(5) SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

The trust's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest. The Trustees have
authorized the repurchase by the trust of up to 10% annually of its own shares
of beneficial interest. The trust repurchased and retired 1,993,000 shares of
beneficial interest during the year ended November 30, 2004 at an average price
per share of $6.66 and a weighted average discount of 10.38% per share. The
trust repurchased and retired 2,202,300 shares of beneficial interest during
the year ended November 30, 2003 at an average price per share of $6.78 and a
weighted average discount of 9.18% per share. Transactions in trust shares were

- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6) LINE OF CREDIT

The trust and other affiliated funds participate in an $800 million unsecured
line of credit provided by a syndication of banks under a line of credit
agreement. Borrowings may be made for temporary financing needs. Interest is
charged to each fund, based on its borrowings, at a rate equal to the Federal
Reserve funds rate plus 0.50%. In addition, a commitment fee, based on the
average daily, unused portion of the line of credit, is allocated among the
participating funds at the end of each calendar quarter. The commitment fee
allocated to the trust for the year ended November 30, 2004 was $3,175, and is
included in miscellaneous expense. The trust had no significant borrowings
during the year ended November 30, 2004.

(7) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The trust trades financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the
normal course of its investing activities in order to manage exposure to market
risks such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These
financial instruments include forward foreign currency exchange contracts and
futures contracts. The notional or contractual amounts of these instruments
represent the investment the trust has in particular classes of financial
instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts potentially subject
to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with these instruments is
meaningful only when all related and offsetting transactions are considered.

(8) LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On March 31, 2004, MFS settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding disclosure of brokerage allocation
practices in connection with MFS fund sales (the term "MFS funds" means the
open-end registered management investment companies sponsored by MFS). Under
the terms of the settlement, in which MFS neither admitted nor denied any
wrongdoing, MFS agreed to pay (one dollar) $1.00 in disgorgement and $50
million in penalty to certain MFS funds, pursuant to a plan developed by an
independent distribution consultant. The brokerage allocation practices which
were the subject of this proceeding were discontinued by MFS in November 2003.
The agreement with the SEC is reflected in an order of the SEC. Pursuant to the
SEC order, on July 28, 2004, MFS transferred these settlement amounts to the
SEC, and those MFS funds entitled to these settlement amounts accrued an
estimate of their pro rata portion of these amounts. Once the final
distribution plan is approved by the SEC, these amounts will be distributed by
the SEC to the affected MFS funds. The SEC settlement order states that MFS
failed to adequately disclose to the Boards of Trustees and to shareholders of
the MFS funds the specifics of its preferred arrangements with certain
brokerage firms selling MFS fund shares. The SEC settlement order states that
MFS had in place policies designed to obtain best execution of all MFS fund
trades. As part of the settlement, MFS retained an independent compliance
consultant to review the completeness of its current policies and practices
regarding disclosure to MFS fund trustees and to MFS fund shareholders of
strategic alliances between MFS or its affiliates and broker-dealers and other
financial advisers who support the sale of MFS fund shares.

In addition, in February, 2004, MFS reached agreement with the SEC, the New
York Attorney General ("NYAG") and the Bureau of Securities Regulation of the
State of New Hampshire ("NH") to settle administrative proceedings alleging
false and misleading information in certain MFS open-end retail fund ("MFS
retail funds") prospectuses regarding market timing and related matters (the
"February Settlements"). These regulators alleged that prospectus language for
certain MFS retail funds was false and misleading because, although the
prospectuses for those funds in the regulators' view indicated that they
prohibited market timing, MFS did not limit trading activity in 11 domestic
large cap stock, high grade bond and money market retail funds. MFS' former
Chief Executive Officer, John W. Ballen, and former President, Kevin R. Parke,
also reached agreement with the SEC in which they agreed to, among other terms,
monetary fines and temporary suspensions from association with any investment
adviser or registered investment company. Messrs. Ballen and Parke have
resigned their positions with, and will not be returning to, MFS and the MFS
funds. Under the terms of the February Settlements, MFS and the executives
neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.

Under the terms of the February Settlements, a $225 million pool has been
established for distribution to shareholders in certain MFS retail funds, which
has been funded by MFS and of which $50 million is characterized as a penalty.
This pool will be distributed in accordance with a methodology developed by an
independent distribution consultant in consultation with MFS and the Board of
Trustees of the MFS retail funds, and acceptable to the SEC. MFS has further
agreed with NYAG to reduce its management fees in the aggregate amount of
approximately $25 million annually over the next five years, and not to
increase certain management fees during this period. MFS has also paid an
administrative fine to NH in the amount of $1 million, which will be used for
investor education purposes (NH retained $250,000 and $750,000 was contributed
to the North American Securities Administrators Association's Investor
Protection Trust). In addition, under the terms of the February Settlements,
MFS is in the process of adopting certain governance changes and reviewing its
policies and procedures.

Since December 2003, MFS, MFS Fund Distributors, Inc., MFS Service Center,
Inc., MFS Corporation Retirement Committee, Sun Life Financial Inc., various
MFS funds, certain current and/or former Trustees of these MFS funds, and
certain officers of MFS have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits
filed in federal and state courts. The lawsuits variously have been commenced
as class actions or individual actions on behalf of investors who purchased,
held or redeemed shares of the MFS funds during specified periods, as class
actions on behalf of participants in certain retirement plan accounts, or as
derivative actions on behalf of the MFS funds. The lawsuits relating to market
timing and related matters have been transferred to, and consolidated before,
the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, as part of a
multi-district litigation of market timing and related claims involving several
other fund complexes (In re Mutual Funds Investment Litigation (Alger,
Columbia, Janus, MFS, One Group, Putnam, Allianz Dresdner), No. 1:04-md-15863
(transfer began March 19, 2004)). The plaintiffs in these consolidated lawsuits
generally seek injunctive relief including removal of the named Trustees,
adviser and distributor, rescission of contracts and 12b-1 Plans, disgorgement
of fees and profits, monetary damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees and
costs and other equitable and declaratory relief. Four lawsuits alleging
improper brokerage allocation practices and excessive compensation are pending
in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Forsythe
v. Sun Life Financial Inc., et al., No. 04cv10584 (GAO) (March 25, 2004);
Eddings v. Sun Life Financial Inc., et al., No. 04cv10764 (GAO) (April 15,
2004); Marcus Dumond, et al. v. Massachusetts Financial Servs. Co., et al., No.
04cv11458 (GAO) (May 4, 2004); and Koslow v. Sun Life Financial Inc., et al.,
No. 04cv11019 (GAO) (May 20, 2004)). The plaintiffs in these lawsuits generally
seek compensatory damages, punitive damages, recovery of fees, rescission of
contracts, an accounting, restitution, declaratory relief, equitable and/or
injunctive relief and attorney's fees and costs. The various lawsuits generally
allege that some or all of the defendants (i) permitted or acquiesced in market
timing and/or late trading in some of the MFS funds, inadequately disclosed
MFS' internal policies concerning market timing and such matters, and received
excessive compensation as fiduciaries to the MFS funds, or (ii) permitted or
acquiesced in the improper use of fund assets by MFS to support the
distribution of MFS fund shares and inadequately disclosed MFS' use of fund
assets in this manner. The actions assert that some or all of the defendants
violated the federal securities laws, including the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as well as fiduciary duties and other violations of common law. Insofar
as any of the actions is appropriately brought derivatively on behalf of any of
the MFS funds, any recovery will inure to the benefit of the MFS funds. The
defendants are reviewing the allegations of the multiple complaints and will
respond appropriately. Additional lawsuits based on similar allegations may be
filed in the future.

Any potential resolution of these matters may include, but not be limited to,
judgments or settlements for damages against MFS, the MFS funds, or any other
named defendant. As noted above, as part of the regulatory settlements, MFS has
established a restitution pool in the amount of $225 million to compensate
certain shareholders of certain MFS retail funds for damages that they
allegedly sustained as a result of market timing or late trading in certain of
the MFS retail funds, and transferred $50 million for distribution to affected
MFS funds to compensate those funds based upon the amount of brokerage
commissions allocated in recognition of MFS fund sales. It is not clear whether
these amounts will be sufficient to compensate shareholders for all of the
damage they allegedly sustained, whether certain shareholders or putative class
members may have additional claims to compensation, or whether the damages that
may be awarded in any of the actions will exceed these amounts. In the event
the MFS funds incur any losses, costs or expenses in connection with such
lawsuits, the Boards of Trustees of the affected MFS funds may pursue claims on
behalf of such funds against any party that may have liability to the funds in
respect thereof.

Review of these matters by the independent Trustees of the MFS funds and their
counsel is continuing. There can be no assurance that these regulatory actions
and lawsuits, or the adverse publicity associated with these developments, will
not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced sales of fund shares, or
other adverse consequences to the MFS funds.

While these developments relate to MFS and the MFS' open-end funds, there can
be no assurance that these developments, or the adverse publicity associated
with these developments, will not result in an increase to the market discount
of the MFS closed-end fund shares or other adverse consequences.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Trustees and Shareholders of MFS Government Markets Income Trust:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the portfolio of investments, of the MFS Government Markets Income
Trust (the "Trust") as of November 30, 2004, and the related statement of
operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets
for each of the two years in the period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of the
securities owned as of November 30, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers. Where replies were not received from brokers, we performed other
auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MFS
Government Markets Income Trust as of November 30, 2004, the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of
the two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for each
of the five years in the period then ended in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The trust holds annual shareholder meetings for the purpose of electing Trustees, and Trustees are
elected for fixed terms. The Board of Trustees is currently divided into three classes, each having a
term of three years. Each year the term of one class expires. Each Trustee's term of office expires on
the date of the third annual meeting following the election to office of the Trustee's class. Each
Trustee will serve until next elected or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement or removal.
Messrs. Ives and Sherratt and Ms. Lane are members of the trust's Audit Committee.

Each of the trust's Trustees and officers holds comparable positions with certain other funds of which
MFS or a subsidiary is the investment adviser or distributor, and, in the case of the officers, with
certain affiliates of MFS. Each Trustee serves as a board member of 99 funds within the MFS Family of
Funds.

In addition, the Trustees have appointed Robert J. Manning, Robert C. Pozen and Laurie J. Thomsen as
Advisory Trustees and have nominated each to be elected as Trustees by shareholders. If elected, Messrs.
Manning and Pozen would serve as interested Trustees while Ms. Thomsen would serve as an independent
Trustee. Information relating to Messrs. Manning and Pozen and Ms. Thomsen is continued in the table

  * This amount reflects the fees billed to MFS and MFS Related Entities for non-audit services relating directly to the
    operations and financial reporting of the Registrant (portions of which services also related to the operations and
    financial reporting of other funds within the MFS Funds complex).
  # This amount reflects the aggregate fees billed by Deloitte for non-audit services rendered to the Registrant and for
    non-audit services rendered to MFS and the MFS Related Entities.
(1) The fees included under "Audit-Related Fees" are fees related to assurance and related services that are reasonably
    related to the performance of the audit or review of financial statements, but not reported under "Audit Fees,"
    including accounting consultations, agreed-upon procedure reports, attestation reports and comfort letters.
(2) The fees included under "Tax Fees" are fees associated with tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning, including
    services relating to the filing or amendment of federal, state or local income tax returns, regulated investment
    company qualification reviews and tax distribution and analysis.
(3) The fees included under "All Other Fees" are fees for products and services provided by Deloitte other than those
    reported under "Audit Fees", "Audit-Related Fees" and "Tax Fees."
</TABLE>

For periods prior to May 6, 2003, the amounts shown above under "Audit-Related
Fees," "Tax Fees" and "All Other Fees" relate to permitted non-audit services
that would have been subject to pre-approval if the Securities and Exchange
Commission's rules relating to pre-approval of non-audit services had been in
effect.

ITEM 4(e)(1):
Set forth below are the policies and procedures established by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Trustees relating to the pre-approval of audit and
non-audit related services: To the extent required by applicable law,
pre-approval by the Audit Committee of the Board is needed for all audit and
permissible non-audit services rendered to the Funds and all permissible
non-audit services rendered to MFS or MFS Related Entities if the services
relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant.
Pre-approval is currently on an engagement-by-engagement basis. In the event
pre-approval of such services is necessary between regular meetings of the
Audit Committee and it is not practical to wait to seek pre-approval at the
next regular meeting of the Audit Committee, such pre-approval of services may
be referred to the Chair of the Audit Committee for approval; provided that the
Chair may not pre-approve any individual engagement for such services exceeding
$50,000 or multiple engagements for such services in the aggregate exceeding
$100,000 between such regular meetings of the Audit Committee. Any engagement
pre-approved by the Chair between regular meetings of the Audit Committee shall
be presented for ratification by the entire Audit Committee at its next
regularly scheduled meeting.

ITEM 4(e)(2):
None, or 0%, of the services relating to the Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and
All Other Fees paid by the Registrant and MFS and MFS Related Entities relating
directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Registrant disclosed
above were approved by the audit committee pursuant to paragraphs (c)(7)(i)(C)
of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (which permits audit committee approval after
the start of the engagement with respect to services other than audit review or
attest services, if certain conditions are satisfied).

ITEM 4(f):  Not applicable.

ITEM 4(h): The Registrant's Audit Committee has considered whether the
provision by a Registrant's independent registered public accounting firm of
non-audit services to MFS and MFS Related Entities that were not pre-approved
by the Committee (because such services were provided prior to the
effectiveness of SEC rules requiring pre-approval or because such services did
not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the
Registrant) was compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent
registered public accounting firm as the Registrant's principal auditors.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The Registrant has an Audit Committee established in accordance with Section
3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The members of the Audit
Committee are Messrs. J. Atwood Ives, William J. Poorvu and J. Dale Sherratt
and Ms. Amy B. Lane. Mr. Poorvu retired as a Trustee effective as of December
31, 2004.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

A schedule of investments of the Registrant is included as part of the report
to shareholders of the Registrant under Item 1 of this Form N-CSR.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The Board of Trustees and the Board of Managers of the investment companies
(the "MFS Funds") advised by Massachusetts Financial Services Company ("MFS")
have delegated to MFS the right and obligation to vote proxies for shares that
are owned by the MFS Funds, in accordance with MFS' proxy voting policies and
procedures (the "MFS Proxy Policies"). The MFS Proxy Policies are set forth
below:
<PAGE>


                    MASSACHUSETTS FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY

                      PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

              SEPTEMBER 17, 2003, AS REVISED ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2004

                  Massachusetts Financial Services Company, MFS Institutional
         Advisors, Inc. and MFS' other investment adviser subsidiaries
         (collectively, "MFS") have adopted proxy voting policies and
         procedures, as set forth below, with respect to securities owned by
         the clients for which MFS serves as investment adviser and has the
         power to vote proxies, including the registered investment companies
         sponsored by MFS, other than the MFS Union Standard Equity Fund (the
         "MFS Funds").

                  These policies and procedures include:

                  A. Voting Guidelines;

                  B. Administrative Procedures;

                  C. Monitoring System;

                  D. Records Retention; and

                  E. Reports.

A. VOTING GUIDELINES


1. GENERAL POLICY; POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         MFS' policy is that proxy voting decisions are made in what MFS
believes to be the best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients, and not
in the interests of any other party or in MFS' corporate interests, including
interests such as the distribution of MFS Fund shares, administration of 401(k)
plans, and institutional relationships.

         MFS has carefully reviewed matters that in recent years have been
presented for shareholder vote by either management or shareholders of public
companies. Based on the guiding principle that all votes made by MFS on behalf
of its clients must be in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic
interests of such clients, MFS has adopted proxy voting guidelines, which are
set forth below, that govern how MFS generally plans to vote on specific
matters presented for shareholder vote. In all cases, MFS will exercise its
discretion to vote these items in accordance with this guiding principle. These
underlying guidelines are simply that - guidelines. Each proxy item is
considered on a case-by-case basis, in light of all relevant facts and
circumstances, and there may be instances in which MFS may vote proxies in a
manner different from these guidelines.

         As a general matter, MFS maintains a consistent voting position with
respect to similar proxy proposals made by various issuers. In addition, MFS
generally votes consistently on the same matter when securities of an issuer
are held by multiple client accounts. However, MFS recognizes that there are
gradations in certain types of proposals that might result in different voting
positions being taken with respect to the different proxy statements. There
also may be situations involving matters presented for shareholder vote that
are not clearly governed by the guidelines, such as proposed mergers and
acquisitions. Some items that otherwise would be acceptable will be voted
against the proponent when it is seeking extremely broad flexibility without
offering a valid explanation. MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines
with respect to a particular shareholder vote when such an override is, in MFS'
best judgment, consistent with the guiding principle of voting proxies in the
best long-term economic interests of MFS' clients.

         From time to time, MFS receives comments on these guidelines and
regarding particular voting issues from its clients. Those comments are
reviewed and considered periodically, and these guidelines are reviewed each
year with MFS Equity Research Department management, the MFS Proxy Review Group
and the MFS Proxy Consultant and are revised as appropriate.

         These policies and procedures are intended to address any potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that could
arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS' clients. MFS
shall be mindful of any and all potential material conflicts of interest that
could arise in the voting of these proxies, shall identify, analyze, document
and report on any such potential conflicts, and shall ultimately vote these
proxies in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of its
clients. The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for monitoring and reporting
on all potential conflicts of interest.

2. MFS' POLICY ON SPECIFIC ISSUES

         NON-SALARY COMPENSATION PROGRAMS

         Managements have become increasingly creative and generous with
compensation programs involving common stock. The original stock option plans,
which called for the optionee to pay the money to exercise the option, are now
embellished with no risk benefits such as stock appreciation rights, the use of
unexercised options to "buy" stock, and restricted stock at bargain prices.

         Stock option plans are supposed to reward results rather than tenure,
so the use of restricted stock at bargain prices is not favored. In some cases,
restricted stock is granted to the recipient at deep discounts to fair market
value, sometimes at par value. The holder cannot sell for a period of years,
but in the meantime is able to vote and receive dividends. Eventually the
restrictions lapse and the stock can be sold.

         MFS votes against option programs for officers, employees or
non-employee directors that do not require an investment by the optionee, that
give "free rides" on the stock price, or that permit grants of restricted stock
at deep discounts to fair market value. MFS generally votes against stock
option plans that involve stock appreciation rights or the use of unexercised
options to "buy" stock.

         MFS opposes plans that provide unduly generous compensation for
officers, directors or employees, or could result in excessive dilution to
other shareholders. As a general guideline, MFS votes against stock option
plans if all such plans for a particular company involve potential dilution, in
the aggregate, of more than 15%.

         MFS votes in favor of stock option plans for non-employee directors as
long as they satisfy the requirements set forth above with respect to stock
option plans for employees. Stock option plans that include options for
consultants and other third parties not involved in the management of the
company generally are opposed by MFS.

         "GOLDEN PARACHUTES"

         From time to time, shareholders of companies have submitted proxy
proposals that would require shareholder approval of any severance packages for
executive officers that exceed certain predetermined thresholds. MFS votes in
favor of such shareholder proposals when they would require shareholder
approval of any severance package for an executive officer that exceeds a
certain percentage of such officer's annual compensation. When put to a vote,
MFS votes against very large golden parachutes.

         ANTI-TAKEOVER MEASURES

         In general, MFS votes against any measure that inhibits capital
appreciation in a stock, including a possible takeover and any proposal that
protects management from action by shareholders. These types of proposals take
many forms, ranging from "poison pills" and "shark repellents" to board
classification and super-majority requirements.

         REINCORPORATION AND REORGANIZATION PROPOSALS

         When presented with a proposal to reincorporate a company under the
laws of a different state, or to effect some other type of corporate
reorganization, MFS considers the underlying purpose and ultimate effect of
such a proposal in determining whether or not to support such a measure. While
MFS generally votes in favor of management proposals that it believes are in
the best long-term economic interests of its clients, MFS may oppose such a
measure if, for example, the intent or effect would be to create additional
inappropriate impediments to possible acquisitions or takeovers.

         DILUTION

         There are many reasons for issuance of stock and most are legitimate.
As noted above under "Non-Salary Compensation Programs", when a stock option
plan (either individually or when aggregated with other plans of the same
company) would substantially dilute the existing equity (e.g., by approximately
15% or more), MFS generally votes against the plan. In addition, MFS votes
against proposals where management is asking for authorization to issue common
or preferred stock with no reason stated (a "blank check") because the
unexplained authorization could work as a potential anti-takeover device.

         CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

         MFS votes in favor of proposals to ensure that shareholder voting
results are kept confidential. For example, MFS supports proposals that would
prevent management from having access to shareholder voting information that is
compiled by an independent proxy tabulation firm.

         INDEPENDENCE OF BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES THEREOF

         While MFS acknowledges the potential benefits of a company's inclusion
of directors who are "independent" from management, MFS generally opposes
shareholder proposals that would require that a majority (or a
"super-majority") of a company's board be comprised of "independent" directors.
Such proposals could inappropriately reduce a company's ability to engage in
certain types of transactions, could result in the exclusion of talented
directors who are not deemed "independent", or could result in the unnecessary
addition of additional "independent" directors to a company's board. However,
in view of the special role and responsibilities of various committees of a
board of directors, MFS supports proposals that would require that the Audit,
Nominating and Compensation Committees be comprised entirely of directors who
are deemed "independent" of the company.

         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

         Recently, some shareholder groups have submitted proposals to limit
the non-audit activities of a company's audit firm. Some proposals would
prohibit the provision of any non-audit services (unless approved in advance by
the full board) whereas other proposals would cap non-audit fees so that such
fees do not exceed a certain percentage of the audit fees. MFS supports such
shareholder proposals that would cap non-audit fees at an amount deemed to be
not excessive.

         BEST PRACTICES STANDARDS

         Best practices standards are rapidly evolving in the corporate
governance areas as a result of recent corporate failures, the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002 and revised listing standards on major stock exchanges. MFS
generally support these changes. However, many issuers are not publicly
registered, are not subject to these enhanced listing standards or are not
operating in an environment that is comparable to that in the United States. In
reviewing proxy proposals under these circumstances, MFS votes for proposals
that enhance standards of corporate governance so long as we believe that --
within the circumstances of the environment within which the issuers operate -
the proposal is consistent with the best long-term economic interests of our
clients.

         FOREIGN ISSUERS - SHARE BLOCKING

         In accordance with local law or business practices, many foreign
companies prevent the sales of shares that have been voted for a certain period
beginning prior to the shareholder meeting and ending on the day following the
meeting ("share blocking"). Depending on the country in which a company is
domiciled, the blocking period may begin a stated number of days prior to the
meeting (e.g., one, three or five days) or on a date established by the
company. While practices vary, in many countries the block period can be
continued for a longer period if the shareholder meeting is adjourned and
postponed to a later date. Similarly, practices vary widely as to the ability
of a shareholder to have the "block" restriction lifted early (e.g., in some
countries shares generally can be "unblocked" up to two days prior to the
meeting whereas in other countries the removal of the block appears to be
discretionary with the issuer's transfer agent). Due to these restrictions, MFS
must balance the benefits to its clients of voting proxies against the
potentially serious portfolio management consequences of a reduced flexibility
to sell the underlying shares at the most advantageous time. For companies in
countries with potentially long block periods, the disadvantage of being unable
to sell the stock regardless of changing conditions generally outweighs the
advantages of voting at the shareholder meeting for routine items. Accordingly,
MFS generally will not vote those proxies in the absence of an unusual,
significant vote. Conversely, for companies domiciled in countries with very
short block periods, MFS generally will continue to cast votes in accordance
with these policies and procedures.

         SOCIAL ISSUES

         There are many groups advocating social change, and many have chosen
the publicly-held corporation as a vehicle for their agenda. Common among these
are resolutions requiring the corporation to refrain from investing or
conducting business in certain countries, to adhere to some list of goals or
principles (e.g., environmental standards) or to report on various activities.
MFS votes against such proposals unless their shareholder-oriented benefits
will outweigh any costs or disruptions to the business, including those that
use corporate resources to further a particular social objective outside the
business of the company or when no discernible shareholder economic advantage
is evident.

         The laws of various states may regulate how the interests of certain
clients subject to those laws are voted. For example, the General Laws of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts prohibit the investment of state funds, including
retirement system assets, in the following types of investments: (i) financial
institutions which directly or through any subsidiary have outstanding loans to
any individual or corporation engaged in manufacturing, distribution or sale of
firearms, munitions, rubber or plastic bullets, tear gas, armored vehicles or
military aircraft for use or deployment in any activity in Northern Ireland; or
(ii) any stocks, securities or obligations of any company so engaged.

         Because of these statutory restrictions, it is necessary when voting
proxies for securities held in Massachusetts public pension accounts to support
the purpose of this legislation. Thus, on issues relating to these or similar
state law questions, it may be necessary to cast ballots differently for these
portfolios than MFS might normally do for other accounts.

B. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

         1. MFS PROXY REVIEW GROUP

         The administration of these policies and procedures is overseen by the
MFS Proxy Review Group, which includes senior MFS Legal Department officers and
MFS' Proxy Consultant. The MFS Proxy Review Group:

            a. Reviews these policies and procedures at least annually and
               recommends any amendments considered to be necessary or
               advisable;

            b. Determines whether any material conflicts of interest exist with
               respect to instances in which (i) MFS seeks to override these
               guidelines and (ii) votes not clearly governed by these
               guidelines; and

            c. Considers special proxy issues as they may arise from time to
               time.

         The current MFS Proxy Consultant is an independent proxy consultant
who performs these services exclusively for MFS.

         2. POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

         The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for monitoring potential
material conflicts of interest on the part of MFS or its affiliates that could
arise in connection with the voting of proxies on behalf of MFS' clients. Any
attempt to influence MFS' voting on a particular proxy matter should be
reported to the MFS Proxy Review Group. The MFS Proxy Consultant will assist
the MFS Proxy Review Group in carrying out these responsibilities.

         In cases where proxies are voted in accordance with these policies and
guidelines, no conflict of interest will be deemed to exist. In cases where (i)
MFS is considering overriding these policies and guidelines, or (ii) matters
presented for vote are not clearly governed by these policies and guidelines,
the MFS Proxy Review Group and the MFS Proxy Consultant will follow these
procedures:

            a. Compare the name of the issuer of such proxy against a list of
               significant current and potential (i) distributors of MFS Fund
               shares, (ii) retirement plans administered by MFS, and (iii) MFS
               institutional clients (the "MFS Significant Client List");

            b. If the name of the issuer does not appear on the MFS Significant
               Client List, then no material conflict of interest will be
               deemed to exist, and the proxy will be voted as otherwise
               determined by the MFS Proxy Review Group;

            c. If the name of the issuer appears on the MFS Significant Client
               List, then the MFS Proxy Review Group will carefully evaluate
               the proposed votes in order to ensure that the proxy ultimately
               is voted in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic
               interests of MFS' clients, and not in MFS' corporate interests;
               and

            d. For all potential material conflicts of interest identified
               under clause (c) above, the MFS Proxy Review Group will
               document: the name of the issuer, the issuer's relationship to
               MFS, the analysis of the matters submitted for proxy vote, and
               the basis for the determination that the votes ultimately were
               cast in what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic
               interests of MFS' clients, and not in MFS' corporate interests.

         The MFS Proxy Review Group is responsible for creating and maintaining
the MFS Significant Client List, in consultation with MFS' distribution,
retirement plan administration and institutional business units. The MFS
Significant Client List will be reviewed and updated as necessary, but no less
frequently than quarterly.

         3. Gathering Proxies

         Nearly all proxies received by MFS originate at Automatic Data
Processing Corp. ("ADP"). ADP and issuers send proxies and related material
directly to the record holders of the shares beneficially owned by MFS'
clients, usually to the client's custodian or, less commonly, to the client
itself. Each client's custodian is responsible for forwarding all proxy
solicitation materials to MFS (except in the case of certain institutional
clients for which MFS does not vote proxies). This material will include proxy
cards, reflecting the proper shareholdings of Funds and of clients on the
record dates for such shareholder meetings, and proxy statements, the issuer's
explanation of the items to be voted upon.

         MFS, on behalf of itself and the Funds, has entered into an agreement
with an independent proxy administration firm, Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. (the "Proxy Administrator"), pursuant to which the Proxy
Administrator performs various proxy vote processing and recordkeeping
functions for MFS' Fund and institutional client accounts. The Proxy
Administrator does not make recommendations to MFS as to how to vote any
particular item. The Proxy Administrator receives proxy statements and proxy
cards directly from various custodians, logs these materials into its database
and matches upcoming meetings with MFS Fund and client portfolio holdings,
which are input into the Proxy Administrator's system by an MFS holdings
datafeed. Through the use of the Proxy Administrator system, ballots and proxy
material summaries for the upcoming shareholders' meetings of over 10,000
corporations are available on-line to certain MFS employees, the MFS Proxy
Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group and most proxies can be voted
electronically. In addition to receiving the hard copies of materials relating
to meetings of shareholders of issuers whose securities are held by the Funds
and/or clients, the ballots and proxy statements can be printed from the Proxy
Administrator's system and forwarded for review.

         4.       Analyzing Proxies

         After input into the Proxy Administrator system, proxies which are
deemed to be completely routine (e.g., those involving only uncontested
elections of directors, appointments of auditors, and/or employee stock
purchase plans)(1) are automatically voted in favor by the Proxy Administrator
without being sent to either the MFS Proxy Consultant or the MFS Proxy Review
Group for further review. Proxies that pertain only to merger and acquisition
proposals are forwarded initially to an appropriate MFS portfolio manager or
research analyst for his or her recommendation. All proxies that are reviewed
by either the MFS Proxy Consultant or a portfolio manager or analyst are then
forwarded with the corresponding recommendation to the MFS Proxy Review
Group.(2)

- ---------------
(1) Proxies for foreign companies often contain significantly more voting items
    than those of U.S. companies. Many of these items on foreign proxies
    involve repetitive, non-controversial matters that are mandated by local
    law. Accordingly, there is an expanded list of items that are deemed
    routine (and therefore automatically voted in favor) for foreign issuers,
    including the following: (i) receiving financial statements or other
    reports from the board; (ii) approval of declarations of dividends; (iii)
    appointment of shareholders to sign board meeting minutes; (iv) the
    discharge of management and supervisory boards; and (v) approval of share
    repurchase programs.

(2) From time to time, due to travel schedules and other commitments, an
    appropriate portfolio manager or research analyst is not available to
    provide a recommendation on a merger or acquisition proposal. If such a
    recommendation cannot be obtained within a few business days prior to the
    shareholder meeting, the MFS Proxy Review Group will determine the vote in
    what MFS believes to be the best long-term economic interests of its
    clients.

         Recommendations with respect to voting on non-routine issues are
generally made by the MFS Proxy Consultant in accordance with the policies
summarized under "Voting Guidelines," and all other relevant materials. His or
her recommendation as to how each proxy proposal should be voted is indicated
on copies of proxy cards, including his or her rationale on significant items.
These cards are then forwarded to the MFS Proxy Review Group.

         As a general matter, portfolio managers and investment analysts are
consulted and involved in developing MFS' substantive proxy voting guidelines,
but have little or no involvement in or knowledge of proxy proposals or voting
positions taken by MFS. This is designed to promote consistency in the
application of MFS' voting guidelines, to promote consistency in voting on the
same or similar issues (for the same or for multiple issuers) across all client
accounts, and to minimize or remove the potential that proxy solicitors,
issuers, and third parties might attempt to exert influence on the vote or
might create a conflict of interest that is not in what MFS believes to be the
best long-term economic interests of our clients. In limited, specific
instances (e.g., mergers), the MFS Proxy Consultant or the MFS Proxy Review
Group may consult with or seek recommendations from portfolio managers or
analysts. The MFS Proxy Review Group would ultimately determine the manner in
which all proxies are voted.

         As noted above, MFS reserves the right to override the guidelines when
such an override is, in MFS' best judgment, consistent with the guiding
principle of voting proxies in the best long-term economic interests of MFS'
clients. Any such override of the guidelines shall be examined, explained and
reported in accordance with the procedures set forth in these policies.

         5. VOTING PROXIES

         After the proxy card copies are reviewed, they are voted
electronically through the Proxy Administrator's system. In accordance with its
contract with MFS, the Proxy Administrator also generates a variety of reports
for the MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group, and makes
available on-line various other types of information so that the MFS Proxy
Review Group and the MFS Proxy Consultant may monitor the votes cast by the
Proxy Administrator on behalf of MFS' clients.

C. MONITORING SYSTEM

         It is the responsibility of the Proxy Administrator and MFS' Proxy
Consultant to monitor the proxy voting process. As noted above, when proxy
materials for clients are received, they are forwarded to the Proxy
Administrator and are input into the Proxy Administrator's system. Additionally,
through an interface with the portfolio holdings database of MFS, the Proxy
Administrator matches a list of all MFS Funds and clients who hold shares of a
company's stock and the number of shares held on the record date with the Proxy
Administrator's listing of any upcoming shareholder's meeting of that company.

         When the Proxy Administrator's system "tickler" shows that the date of
a shareholders' meeting is approaching, a Proxy Administrator representative
checks that the vote for MFS Funds and clients holding that security has been
recorded in the computer system. If a proxy card has not been received from the
client's custodian, the Proxy Administrator calls the custodian requesting that
the materials be forward immediately. If it is not possible to receive the
proxy card from the custodian in time to be voted at the meeting, MFS may
instruct the custodian to cast the vote in the manner specified and to mail the
proxy directly to the issuer.

D. RECORDS RETENTION

         MFS will retain copies of these policies and procedures in effect from
time to time and will retain all proxy voting reports submitted to the Board of
Trustees and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds for a period of six years.
Proxy solicitation materials, including electronic versions of the proxy cards
completed by the MFS Proxy Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group, together
with their respective notes and comments, are maintained in an electronic
format by the Proxy Administrator and are accessible on-line by the MFS Proxy
Consultant and the MFS Proxy Review Group. All proxy voting materials and
supporting documentation, including records generated by the Proxy
Administrator's system as to proxies processed, the dates when proxies were
received and returned, and the votes on each company's proxy issues, are
retained for six years.

E. REPORTS

         MFS FUNDS

         Periodically, MFS will report the results of its voting to the Board
of Trustees and Board of Managers of the MFS Funds. These reports will include:
(i) a listing of how votes were cast; (ii) a review of situations where MFS did
not vote in accordance with the guidelines and the rationale therefor; (iii) a
review of the procedures used by MFS to identify material conflicts of
interest; and (iv) a review of these policies and the guidelines and, as
necessary or appropriate, any proposed modifications thereto to reflect new
developments in corporate governance and other issues. Based on these reviews,
the Trustees and Managers of the MFS Funds will consider possible modifications
to these policies to the extent necessary or advisable.

         ALL MFS ADVISORY CLIENTS

         At any time, a report can be printed by MFS for each client who has
requested that MFS furnish a record of votes cast. The report specifies the
proxy issues which have been voted for the client during the year and the
position taken with respect to each issue.

         Generally, MFS will not divulge actual voting practices to any party
other than the client or its representatives (unless required by applicable
law) because we consider that information to be confidential and proprietary to
the client.

Note: All share purchases were made pursuant to publicly announced share
repurchase programs approved by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees
approves procedures to repurchase shares annually. The notification to
shareholders of the program is part of the semi-annual and annual reports sent
to shareholders. These annual programs begin on March 1st of each year. The
programs conform to the conditions of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and limit the aggregate number of shares that may be purchased in
each annual period (March 1 through the following February 28) to 10% of the
Registrant's outstanding shares as of the first day of the plan year (March 1).
The aggregate number of shares available for the March 1, 2004 plan year are
5,514,036.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

There were no material changes to the procedures by which shareholders may send
recommendations to the Board for nominees to the Registrant's Board since the
Registrant last provided disclosure as to such procedures in response to the
requirements of Item 7(d)(2)(ii)(G) of Schedule 14A.

ITEM 11. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.

(a) Based upon their evaluation of the registrant's disclosure controls and
    procedures (as defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Act) as conducted within

    financial officer and principal executive officer have concluded that
    those disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that
    the material information required to be disclosed by the registrant on

                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                          PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I. COVERED OFFICERS/PURPOSE OF THE CODE

         This code of ethics (this "Code") has been adopted by the funds
(collectively, "Funds" and each, "Fund") under supervision of the MFS Funds
Board and Compass Board of Trustees/Managers (the "Boards") and applies to the
Funds' Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer (the
"Covered Officers" each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of
promoting:

         o honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual
           or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional
           relationships;

         o full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
           reports and documents that the Funds file with, or submits to, the
           Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
           communications made by the Funds;

         o compliance by the Funds with applicable laws and governmental rules
           and regulations;

         o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an
           appropriate person or persons identified in the Code; and

         o accountability for adherence to the Code.

II. CONDUCT GUIDELINES

         Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business
ethics and should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as
well as apparent conflicts of interest. In addition, each Covered Officer
should not place his or her personal interests ahead of the Funds' interests
and should endeavor to act honestly and ethically. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Covered Officer must:

         o not use his or her personal influence or personal relationships
           improperly to influence investment decisions or financial reporting
           for any Fund whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to
           the detriment of the Fund; and

         o not cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the
           individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
           benefit the Fund.

         The following activities, which could create the appearance of a
conflict of interest, are permitted only with the approval of the Funds' Chief
Legal Officer ("CLO"):

         o service as a director on the board of any "for profit" company;

         o running for political office;

         o the receipt of any Fund business-related gift in excess of $300;

         o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which a Fund
           has current or prospective business dealings unless such
           entertainment is business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate
           as to time and place, and not so frequent as to raise any question
           of impropriety;

         o any material ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment
           relationship with, any Fund service providers (e.g., custodian
           banks, audit firms), other than the Funds' investment adviser,
           principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
           thereof;

         o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction
           charges or spreads paid by a Fund for effecting portfolio
           transactions or for selling or redeeming shares, other than an
           interest arising from the Covered Officer's employment or securities
           ownership.

III. DISCLOSURE AND COMPLIANCE

         o Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself or herself with the
           disclosure requirements generally applicable to the Funds;

         o each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause
           others to misrepresent, facts about a Fund to others, whether within
           or outside the Fund, including to the Fund's trustees and auditors,
           and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

         o each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or
           her area of Fund responsibility, consult with other officers and
           employees of the Funds and the adviser with the goal of promoting
           full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in the
           reports and documents the Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and
           in other public communications made by the Funds; and

         o it is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote
           compliance within his or her area of Fund responsibility with the
           standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
           regulations.

IV. REPORTING AND ACCOUNTABILITY

         Each Covered Officer must:

         o upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon
           becoming a Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Boards that he
           or she has received, read, and understands the Code;

         o annually thereafter affirm to the Boards that he or she has complied
           with the requirements of the Code;

         o annually report to the CLO affiliations and relationships which are
           or may raise the appearance of a conflict of interest with the
           Covered Officer's duties to the Funds, as identified in the annual
           Trustee and Officer Questionnaire;

         o not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any officer or
           employee of the Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of
           potential violations that are made in good faith; and

         o notify the CLO promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this
           Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of this Code.


The CLO is responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which
questions are presented under it, granting waivers upon consultation with the
appropriate Board or its designee, investigating violations, and has the
authority to interpret this Code in any particular situation. The CLO will
report requests for waivers to the appropriate Board (or a designee thereof)
promptly upon receipt of a waiver request and will periodically report to the
appropriate Board any approvals granted since the last report.

         The CLO will take all appropriate action to investigate any potential
         violations reported to him or her and to report any violations to the
         appropriate Board. If the Board concurs that a violation has occurred,
         it will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
         appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures;
         notification to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its
         board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer.

         Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required,
be disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

V. OTHER POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

         This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the Funds, the Funds' adviser, principal underwriter,
or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or
activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The Funds' and their investment adviser's codes of
ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act and any other codes or
policies or procedures adopted by the Funds or their investment adviser or
other service providers are separate requirements and are not part of this
Code.

VI. AMENDMENTS

         Any amendments to this Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must
be approved or ratified by a majority vote of each Board, including a majority
of independent trustees.

VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

         All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to this Code
and under the direction of the CLO will be considered confidential and shall be
maintained and protected accordingly. Except as otherwise required by law or
this Code, such matters shall not be disclosed to anyone other than the
appropriate Funds' Board, its counsel, counsel to the Board's independent
trustees and senior management and the board of directors of the Fund's
investment adviser and its counsel.

VIII. INTERNAL USE

         The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Funds and does
not constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

        registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5. The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed to the
   registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
   directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     a. all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
        operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
        reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
        record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     b. any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
        employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
        control over financial reporting.
