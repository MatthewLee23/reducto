             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Members and Board of Directors of
       UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C.

We have audited the accompanying  statement of assets,  liabilities and members'
capital of UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C. (the "Fund"),  including the schedule
of portfolio investments, as of December 31, 2004, and the related statements of
operations  and cash flows for the year then ended and the statements of changes
in members'  capital  for each of the two years in the period then ended.  These
financial  statements  are the  responsibility  of the  Fund's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on these financial  statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance  with the standards of the Public  Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as a basis  for  designing  audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the  effectiveness  of the Fund's internal control over
financial  reporting.  Accordingly,  we express no such  opinion.  An audit also
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial  statements,  assessing the  accounting  principles
used and  significant  estimates made by management,  and evaluating the overall
financial  statement  presentation.  Our  procedures  included  confirmation  of
investments owned as of December 31, 2004, by correspondence  with management of
the investment  funds. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements  referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of UBS Technology Partners, L.L.C.
at December 31, 2004,  the results of its  operations and its cash flows for the
year then ended and the  changes  in its  members'  capital  for each of the two
years in the period then  ended,  in  conformity  with U.S.  generally  accepted
accounting principles.

                                                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.    ORGANIZATION

      UBS Technology Partners,  L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized as a
      limited  partnership  under the laws of Delaware on December  28, 1998 and
      was  subsequently  reorganized as a limited  liability  company  effective
      October 15, 2002. The Fund is registered under the Investment  Company Act
      of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"),  as a  closed-end,  non-diversified,
      management  investment  company.  The Fund's  investment  objective  is to
      maximize  capital  appreciation  over the long-term.  The Fund pursues its
      investment  objective by  deploying  its assets  primarily  among a select
      group  of  portfolio  managers  who  invest  primarily  in,  or  who  have
      particular  knowledge  within,  the  technology  sector.  Generally,  such
      portfolio managers conduct their investment programs through  unregistered
      investment funds (collectively,  the "Investment Funds") in which the Fund
      invests as a limited  partner or member  along with other  investors.  The
      Fund commenced operations on April 1, 1999.

      The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall responsibility
      to manage and  control the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
      exclusive  authority to oversee and to establish  policies  regarding  the
      management,  conduct and operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
      have  engaged UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "UBSFA" or  "Manager"),  a
      Delaware limited liability company and the Manager of the Fund, to provide
      investment  advice  regarding the selection of Investment  Funds and to be
      responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

      The Manager is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of UBS Americas,  Inc.,
      which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG, and is  registered  as an
      investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

      Initial and additional  applications  for interests by eligible  investors
      may be  accepted  at such  times  as the  Manager  may  determine  and are
      generally  accepted  monthly.  The Fund  reserves  the right to reject any
      application for interests in the Fund.

      The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase  interests  pursuant to
      written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases will be made at such times
      and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors, in their complete
      and exclusive  discretion.  The Manager  expects that  generally,  it will
      recommend to the  Directors  that the Fund offer to  repurchase  interests
      from Members twice in each year,  near mid-year and year-end.  Members can
      only transfer or assign their membership interests,  or a portion thereof,
      (i) by operation of law pursuant to the death,  bankruptcy,  insolvency or
      dissolution  of a  Member,  or  (ii)  with  the  written  approval  of the
      Directors,  which may be withheld in their sole and  absolute  discretion.
      Such  transfers may be made even if the balance of the capital  account to
      such transferee is equal to or less than the transferor's  initial capital
      contribution.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

      A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION

      Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction of the
      Manager as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
      accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set forth  below or as may be
      determined  from time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
      Directors.


                                                                               6

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      A.    PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

      The Fund's  investments  in Investment  Funds are subject to the terms and
      conditions of the respective  operating agreements and offering memoranda,
      as appropriate.  The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are carried at
      fair value as determined by the Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets
      of each  Investment  Fund. All valuations  utilize  financial  information
      supplied by each Investment Fund and are net of management and performance
      incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers or
      pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.  The  Fund's  valuation
      procedures  require  the  Manager to  consider  all  relevant  information
      available at the time the Fund values its  portfolio.  The Manager  and/or
      the Board  will  consider  such  information  and  consider  whether it is
      appropriate,  in  light of all  relevant  circumstances,  to value  such a
      position  at its net asset  value as  reported  or whether to adjust  such
      value.  The underlying  investments of each  Investment Fund are accounted
      for at fair  value  as  described  in  each  Investment  Fund's  financial
      statements. (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments)

      Distributions  received or withdrawals from Investment  Funds,  whether in
      the form of cash or  securities,  are first  applied as a reduction of the
      investment's cost.

      B.    INCOME RECOGNITION

      Interest  income is  recorded  on the accrual  basis.  Realized  gains and
      losses from Investment Fund  transactions are calculated on the identified
      cost basis.

      C.    FUND COSTS

      The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business,  including,  but not
      limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to portfolio
      transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees; accounting
      and auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
      value; costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  organization
      costs; due diligence,  including travel and related expenses;  expenses of
      meetings  of   Directors   and   Members;   all  costs  with   respect  to
      communications  to Members;  and other  types of expenses  approved by the
      Directors. Offering costs are charged to capital as incurred.

      D.    INCOME TAXES

      No provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
      been provided, since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member is
      individually  required  to report on its own tax return  its  distributive
      share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

      The Fund has reclassified  $5,471,247 and $64,417,958 from accumulated net
      investment  loss and  accumulated  net  realized  gain  from  investments,
      respectively,  to net capital contributions during the year ended December
      31, 2004.  The  reclassification  was to reflect,  as an adjustment to net
      capital contributions, the amount of taxable income or loss that have been
      allocated to the Fund's Members and had no effect on net assets.


                                                                               7

                                       NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

      E.    CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

      Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested in a PNC Bank,  NA
      account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted for at cost plus
      accrued interest which is included in interest receivable on the Statement
      of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

      F.    REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

      From  time to time the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
      connection  with  such  transactions  it is the  Fund's  policy  that  its
      custodian take  possession of the underlying  collateral  securities,  the
      fair  value  of which  exceeds  the  principal  amount  of the  repurchase
      transaction,  including  accrued  interest,  at all  times.  If the seller
      defaults,  and the fair value of the collateral  declines,  realization of
      the  collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.  As of December 31,
      2004 there were no open repurchase agreements.

      G.    USE OF ESTIMATES

      The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S. generally
      accepted accounting  principles requires the Manager to make estimates and
      assumptions that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
      and accompanying  notes. The Manager believes that the estimates  utilized
      in preparing the Fund's  financial  statements are reasonable and prudent;
      however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

      UBSFA provides certain management and administrative services to the Fund,
      including,  among other things,  providing  office space and other support
      services.  In  consideration  for such  services,  the Fund  pays  UBSFA a
      monthly  management  fee (the "Fee") at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's
      net  assets,  excluding  assets  attributable  to  the  Manager's  capital
      account.  The Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the Fund's  assets  and  debited
      against the Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding the Manager's  capital
      account. A portion of the fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

      UBS Financial Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
      Americas,  Inc., acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
      compensation  from the Fund, and bears its own costs  associated  with its
      activities  as  placement  agent.  Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
      contributions are debited against the contribution amounts, to arrive at a
      net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute assets of
      the Fund.

      The net increase (or decrease) in members' capital derived from operations
      (net income or loss) is initially allocated to the capital accounts of all
      Members  on a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than the Fee  which  is  similarly
      allocated  to all Members  other than the Manager as described  above.  In
      accordance with the Limited  Liability Company  Agreement,  the Manager is
      then allocated an amount based on the


                                                                               8

                                                               DECEMBER 31, 2004

3.    RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

      performance  of the Fund (the  "Performance  Bonus")  for the  Measurement
      Period,  as  defined  in the  Confidential  Memorandum  (i.e.,  the period
      commencing on the admission of a Member to the Fund, and  thereafter  each
      period  commencing on the day following  the last  Measurement  Period and
      ending  generally on the first to occur of (1) a fiscal  year-end or (2) a
      whole  or  partial  redemption).   The  Performance  Bonus  is  calculated
      separately with respect to each Member.

      The  Performance  Bonus  is  equal to 1% of the  balance  of the  Member's
      capital  account  at the  end of the  Measurement  Period,  provided  that
      appreciation  in the  Member's  capital  account  (net of any  Performance
      Bonus) exceeds the Member's  threshold return. The threshold return is the
      amount  that a  Member  would  have  earned  for a  fiscal  year if it had
      received  an  annualized  rate of  return  of 20% on its  opening  capital
      account balance, as adjusted. No Performance Bonus was earned for the year
      ended December 31, 2004.

      Each Director who is not an "interested person" of the Fund, as defined by
      the 1940 Act,  receives  an annual  retainer of $5,000 plus a fee for each
      meeting  attended.  Any  Director who is an  "interested  person" does not
      receive  any  annual  or other  fee  from  the  Fund.  All  Directors  are
      reimbursed by the Fund for all  reasonable out of pocket  expenses.  Total
      amounts  expensed  by the Fund  related  to  Directors  for the year ended
      December 31, 2004 were $23,374.

4.    ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

      PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as custodian (the
      "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial services for the
      Fund.

      PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as Administrator  and
      Accounting  Agent  to the  Fund  and in  that  capacity  provides  certain
      administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax and  investor  related
      services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee primarily  based upon (i) the
      average net assets of the Fund, subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii)
      the aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
      sponsored or advised by UBS Americas, Inc. or it affiliates. Additionally,
      the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

5.    CREDIT FACILITY

      Effective  July 2, 2004, the Fund,  along with other UBS sponsored  funds,
      entered into a $75,000,000  committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit
      with  Harris  Trust  and  Savings   Bank.   Under  the  most   restrictive
      arrangement,  the Fund may borrow an amount that  combined  with the other
      borrowings of the Fund would not exceed 20% of its net assets.  The Fund's
      borrowing  capacity  is also  limited to the portion of the unused line of
      credit at any  point in time.  The Fund is only  liable  under the line of
      credit to the extent of its own borrowing thereunder. The interest rate on
      the borrowing is based on the Federal Funds rate plus 150 basis points per
      annum. The expiration date of such credit  agreements is July 1, 2005. The
      committed  facility  also  requires  a fee to be  paid by the  Fund,  on a
      prorata basis,  based on the amount of the aggregate  commitment which has
      not been utilized of 25 basis points per annum. The fund has no borrowings
      outstanding at December 31, 2004.


                                                                               9

6.    SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS

      Aggregate  purchases  and sales of  Investment  Funds  for the year  ended
      December 31, 2004, amounted to $48,750,000 and $204,510,162, respectively.

      The cost of  investments  for Federal  income tax purposes is adjusted for
      items of taxable income  allocated to the Fund from the Investment  Funds.
      The  allocated  taxable  income is reported to the Fund by the  Investment
      Funds on Schedules  K-1. The Fund has not yet received all such  Schedules
      K-1 for the year ended December 31, 2004.

7.    INVESTMENTS

      As of December 31, 2004,  the Fund had  investments  in Investment  Funds,
      none of which were related parties.  The Fund's investments are summarized
      below based on the investment  objectives of the specific Investment Funds
      at December 31, 2004.

              INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE               COST               FAIR VALUE
              --------------------               ----               ----------
                Long/Short Equity            $314,514,335          $382,535,327

      The  agreements  related to  investments  in Investment  Funds provide for
      compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of management
      fees of 1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and performance  incentive fees
      or allocations of 20% of net profits earned.  The Investment Funds provide
      for  periodic  redemptions,  with lock up  provisions  ranging up to three
      years from initial investment.  Detailed  information about the Investment
      Funds' portfolios is not available.

8.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

      In the normal course of business,  the Investment  Funds in which the Fund
      invests  trade  various  financial  instruments  and  enter  into  various
      investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are
      not  limited to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
      contracts for  differences,  and equity swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
      these  Investment  Funds is limited to the value of these  investments  as
      reported by the Fund.

9.    INDEMNIFICATION

      In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into contracts or
      agreements  that contain  indemnifications  or  warranties.  Future events
      could occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against the
      Fund. Based on its history and experience, management feels the likelihood
      of such an event is remote.

      (a)   Ratio of total  expenses  to average net assets does not include the
            impact of expenses  for  incentivE  allocations  or  incentive  fees
            related to the underlying Investment Funds.

      *     Annualized.

      **    Total  return  assumes a purchase  of an interest in the Fund at the
            beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund  interest on the last
            day of the  period  noted  and does not  reflect  the  deduction  of
            placement fees, if any, incurred when subscribing to the Fund. Total
            returns for a period of less than a full year are not annualized. An
            individual  member's ratios and return may vary from the above based
            on incentive  allocation,  if  applicable  and the timing of capital
            transactions.

      ***   Total  return  assumes a purchase  of an interest in the Fund at the
            beginning of the period and a sale of the Fund  interest on the last
            day of the period noted, after Performance Bonus to the Manager, and
            does not reflect the deduction of placement  fees, if any,  incurred
            when  subscribing  to the Fund.  Total  returns for a period of less
            than a full year are not annualized.

      ****  The average net assets used in the above  ratios are  calculated  by
            adding any withdrawals  payable  effective at the end of a period to
            the net assets for such period.

11.   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

      Bank was increased to a commitment of $150,000,000.

    (b)  The  aggregate  fees  billed in each of the last two  fiscal  years for
         assurance  and related  services by the principal  accountant  that are

         financial  statements and are not reported under  paragraph (a) of this
         Item are  $4,500  for 2003 and  $4,500  for  2004.  Audit-related  fees

    (c)  The  aggregate  fees  billed in each of the last two  fiscal  years for
         professional  services  rendered by the  principal  accountant  for tax
         compliance,  tax advice,  and tax  planning  are  $146,500 for 2003 and

         $8,000  for 2003 and  $8,000  for  2004.  Fees for all  other  services
         include fees for administrative  services associated with preparing the

         years  for  services  rendered  by  the  principal  accountant  to  the
         registrant's  investment  adviser (not including any sub-adviser  whose
         role is primarily  portfolio  management and is  subcontracted  with or
         overseen by another investment  adviser),  and any entity  controlling,
         controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that
         provides ongoing services to the registrant ("Service Affiliate") which
         were required to be pre-approved by the audit committee.

    (e)(1)    The  registrant's  audit  committee   pre-approves  the  principal
              accountant's  engagements for audit and non-audit  services to the
              registrant,  and certain non-audit  services to service Affiliates
              that are required to be  pre-approved,  on a  case-by-case  basis.
              Pre-approval  considerations include whether the proposed services
              are  compatible  with   maintaining  the  principal   accountant's
              independence.


    (e)(2)    There were no services described in each of paragraphs (b) through
              (d) of  this  Item  that  were  approved  by the  audit  committee
              pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X,
              because such services were pre-approved.

    (f)  Not applicable.


    (g)  The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the registrant's  accountant for
         services rendered to the registrant, and rendered to Service Affiliates
         for each of the  last  two  fiscal  years  of the  registrant  was $1.2
         million for 2003 and $1.5 million for 2004.

    (h)  The  registrant's  audit  committee  of  the  board  of  directors  HAS
         considered  whether  the  provision  of  non-audit  services  that were
         rendered to Service  Affiliates that were not pre-approved  pursuant to
         paragraph  (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X is compatible with
         maintaining the principal accountant's independence.


ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

Not applicable.
<PAGE>

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

Schedule of Investments in securities of unaffiliated issuers as of the close of
the  reporting  period is included as part of the report to  shareholders  filed
under Item 1 of this form.


ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
         MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The  registrant  is a fund of  funds  that  invests  primarily  in  unregistered
investment vehicles that have investors other than the registrant,  and in other
registered  investment  companies  ("Investment  Funds").  The Fund may invest a
majority of its assets in non-voting securities of Investment Funds.

The registrant has delegated voting of proxies in respect of portfolio  holdings
to UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "Adviser"),  to vote the Fund's  proxies in
accordance with the Adviser's proxy voting  guidelines and procedures.  However,
Investment  Funds  typically do not submit  matters to investors for vote. If an
Investment  Fund submits a matter to the registrant for vote (and the registrant
holds voting  interests in the  Investment  Fund),  the Adviser will vote on the
matter in a way that it believes is in the best interest of the  registrant  and
in  accordance  with  the  following   proxy  voting   guidelines  (the  "Voting
Guidelines"):


       o     In voting  proxies,  the  Adviser  is guided by  general  fiduciary
             principles.  The Adviser's goal is to act prudently,  solely in the
             best interest of the registrant.

       o     The Adviser attempts to consider all factors of its vote that could
             affect  the value of the  investment  and will vote  proxies in the
             manner that it believes will be consistent with efforts to maximize
             shareholder values.

       o     The Adviser, absent a particular reason to the contrary,  generally
             will vote with  management's  recommendations  on routine  matters.
             Other matters will be voted on a case-by-case basis.

The Adviser  applies its Voting  Guidelines in a manner designed to identify and
address  material  conflicts that may arise between the Adviser's  interests and
those of its  clients  before  voting  proxies  on behalf of such  clients.  The
Adviser  relies on the following to seek to identify  conflicts of interest with
respect to proxy voting and assess their materiality:

       o     The Adviser's  employees are under an obligation (i) to be aware of
             the  potential for conflicts of interest on the part of the Adviser
             with respect to voting proxies on behalf of client accounts both as
             a result of an employee's personal relationships and due to special
             circumstances  that may arise  during the conduct of the  Adviser's
             business,  and (ii) to bring  conflicts  of  interest of which they
             become aware to the attention of certain designated persons.

       o     Such  designated  persons  work with  appropriate  personnel of the
             Adviser to determine whether an identified  conflict of interest is
             material. A conflict of interest will be considered material to the
             extent that it is  determined  that such conflict has the potential
             to influence the Adviser's decision-making in voting the proxy. All
             materiality  determinations  will be based
<PAGE>

             on an assessment of the  particular  facts and  circumstances.  The
             Adviser  shall  maintain  a  written  record  of  all   materiality
             determinations.

       o     If it is  determined  that a conflict of interest is not  material,
             the Adviser may vote proxies  notwithstanding  the existence of the
             conflict.

       o     If it is  determined  that a conflict of interest is material,  the
             Adviser's legal department works with appropriate  personnel of the
             Adviser to agree upon a method to resolve such conflict of interest
             before voting  proxies  affected by the conflict of interest.  Such
             methods may include:

             o  disclosing the conflict to the registrant's  Board and obtaining
                the consent from registrant's Board before voting;

             o  engaging another party on behalf of the client to vote the proxy
                on its behalf;

             o  engaging a third party to  recommend a vote with  respect to the
                proxy based on application of the policies set forth herein; or

             o  such   other   method  as  is  deemed   appropriate   under  the
                circumstances  given the nature of the  conflict.

       o     The Adviser shall  maintain a written  record of the method used to
             resolve a material conflict of interest.

         Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (17 CFR  240.13a-15(b)  or
         240.15d-15(b)).

    (b)  There  were  no  changes  in the  registrant's  internal  control  over
         financial reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act (17
         CFR 270.30a-3(d))  that occurred during the registrant's  second fiscal
         quarter  of the  period  covered by this  report  that have  materially
         affected,   or  is  reasonably   likely  to  materially   affect,   the

              period in which this report is being prepared;

         (b)  Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
              such  internal  control  over  financial  reporting to be designed

              generally accepted accounting principles;

              procedures,  as of a date  within 90 days prior to the filing date
              of this report based on such evaluation; and

              control over financial  reporting that occurred  during the second
              fiscal  quarter of the  period  covered  by this  report  that has
              materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
              the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

5.       The registrant's  other  certifying  officer(s) and I have disclosed to
         the  registrant's  auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's
         board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

         (a)  All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
              or operation of internal  control over financial  reporting  which
              are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability
              to record, process,  summarize,  and report financial information;
              and

         (b)  Any fraud,  whether or not material,  that involves  management or
              other  employees who have a significant  role in the  registrant's
