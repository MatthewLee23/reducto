The Eaton Vance organization is committed to ensuring your financial privacy.
This notice is being sent to comply with privacy regulations of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Each of the above financial institutions has in effect
the following policy with respect to nonpublic personal information about its
customers:

- - Only such information received from you, through application forms or
  otherwise, and information about your Eaton Vance fund transactions will be

                                IMPORTANT NOTICE
                              REGARDING DELIVERY OF
                              SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission permits funds to deliver only one copy of
shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements and shareholder
reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same residential or
post office box address. This practice is often called "householding" and it
helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.

EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISER, MAY HOUSEHOLD THE MAILING OF YOUR
DOCUMENTS INDEFINITELY UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT EATON VANCE, OR YOUR FINANCIAL
ADVISER, OTHERWISE.

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your
financial adviser.

From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities
held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote
proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds' and
Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and
procedures without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122. This

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003

INVESTMENT UPDATE

INVESTMENT ENVIRONMENT

  THE LOAN MARKET
- - The loan market - and the Trust - performed well in 2003, as a stronger
  economy generated strong impressive profit growth. Not surprisingly, credit
  conditions made a turn for the better, as balance sheets improved. Reflecting
  that trend, loan default rates were significantly lower than a year ago.

- - The loan market was characterized by strong investor demand that surpassed new
  loan supply. While merger and acquisition activity has resulted in some new
  deals, strong technicals within the loan market have caused a slight decline
  in interest rate spreads. Nonetheless, loans continued to provide a yield
  advantage over most short-term fixed-income vehicles.

- - The Federal Reserve's benchmark Federal Funds rate remained at a 45-year low.
  However, by year-end, a stronger economy led to growing speculation about the
  possibility of a reversal in policy and future rate increases. Floating-rate
  loans would benefit if there is an uptick in rates.

THE TRUST

  PERFORMANCE
- - Based on the Trust's December 2003 monthly dividend of $0.036 and a closing
  share price of $9.22, the Trust had a market yield of 4.69%.(1) The Trust's
  market yield represented a yield advantage over many other income-producing
  vehicles.

  THE TRUST'S INVESTMENTS
- - Diversification has remained a primary theme.(2) The Trust has maintained an
  exposure to a range of industries, including cyclical and defensive sectors.
  At December 31, 2003, the Trust included 261 borrowers, representing 48
  industries, with no single sector accounting for as much as 10% of the Trust.
  The average exposure to a single issuer as a percentage of the Trust's total
  net assets was just 0.33%. High-yield corporate bonds constituted 12.0% of the
  Trust's net assets. The Trust had leverage (borrowing and auction preferred
  shares) of $203 million at December 31, 2003, representing 39.2% of the
  Trust's total assets.

- - The Trust's largest sector weighting was printing and publishing companies.
  Overall, the sector held up very well during the economic downturn in
  2001-2002 and has historically benefited from an economic recovery. The Trust
  had several investments in newspaper companies whose revenues are based on
  local advertising expenditures. Local ad spending has tended to be more stable
  in economic downturns than national advertising. In addition, newspaper
  companies have benefited from a consolidation trend within the sector, with
  larger chains buying smaller newspaper companies.

- - In the cable television area, the Trust had investments in several of the
  nation's leading cable and satellite broadcasting services. For example, one
  company registered 20% revenue growth in 2003, driven by strong subscriber
  growth and an impressive increase in per-subscriber revenues.

- - Within the chemical sector, the Trust had investments in both specialty and
  commodity chemical producers. One such company is one of the largest
  manufacturers of base commodity chemicals, such as ethylene, propylene and
  polyurethene, key inputs used in the manufacture of plastics. Other companies
  create chemicals used in textile manufacture and polymers used in paints,
  coatings and adhesives.

- - While no sectors specifically hurt performance, the Trust had an
  underweighting in the distressed technology and telecom sectors. These sectors
  declined sharply during last year's market decline and, not surprisingly,
  rallied more sharply than the broad market as the economy rebounded in 2003.

The views expressed in this report are those of the portfolio managers and are
current only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover.
These views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other
conditions, and Eaton Vance disclaims any responsibility to update such views.
These views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment
decisions for an Eaton Vance fund are based on many factors, may not be relied
on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Eaton Vance fund.

</Table>

(1) The Trust's market yield is calculated by dividing the most recent dividend
per share by the share market price at the end of the period and annualizing the
result. (2) The Trust is a non-diversified investment. (3) Returns are
historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in market
value or net asset value with all distributions reinvested. (4) Five Largest
Sector Weightings account for 39.0% of the Trust's net assets, determined by
dividing the total market value of the holdings by the net assets of the Trust.
Five Largest Sector Weightings refer only to senior floating-rate loan portion
of the Trust and are subject to change.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and
principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more
or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period
only; due to market volatility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or
higher.


Shares of the Trust are not insured by the FDIC and are not deposits or other
obligations of, or guaranteed by, any depository institution. Shares are subject
to investment risks, including possible loss of principal invested. Yield will
change.

PIK - Payment-In-Kind.

(1)  Senior floating-rate interests often require prepayments from excess cash
     flows or permit the borrower to repay at its election. The degree to which
     borrowers repay, whether as a contractual requirement or at their election,
     cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result, the actual remaining
     maturity may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
     However, it is anticipated that the senior floating-rate interests will
     have an expected average life of approximately two to four years.

(2)  Non-income producing security.

(3)  Security valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or
     at the direction of the Trustees.

(4)  Security exempt from registration under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of
     1933. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt from
     registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers.

Note: At December 31, 2003, the Trust had unfunded commitments amounting to
$9,483,606 under various revolving credit agreements.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust (the Trust) is an entity commonly known as a
   Massachusetts business trust and is registered under the Investment Company
   Act of 1940 as a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.
   The Trust's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income
   consistent with the preservation of capital, by investing primarily in
   senior, floating rate loans. The following is a summary of significant
   accounting policies consistently followed by the Trust in the preparation of
   its financial statements. The policies are in conformity with accounting
   principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

   Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for presentation purposes.

   A INVESTMENT VALUATIONS -- The Trust's investments are primarily in interests
   in senior floating rate loans (Senior Loans). Certain Senior Loans are deemed
   liquid because reliable market quotations are readily available for them.
   Liquid loans are valued on the basis of prices furnished by a pricing
   service. Other Senior Loans are valued at fair value by the Trust's
   investment adviser, Eaton Vance Management (EVM), under procedures
   established by the Trustees as permitted by Section 2(a)(41) of the
   Investment Company Act of 1940. Such procedures include the consideration of
   relevant factors, data and information relating to fair value, including (i)
   the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data relating to the Senior
   Loan, including the cost, size, current interest rate, period until next
   interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate of the Senior Loan, the
   terms and conditions of the Senior Loan and any related agreements and the
   position of the loan in the borrower's debt structure; (ii) the nature,
   adequacy and value of the collateral, including the Trust's rights, remedies
   and interests with respect to the collateral; (iii) the creditworthiness of
   the Borrower, based on evaluations of its financial condition, financial
   statements and information about the Borrower's business, cash flows, capital
   structure and future prospects; (iv) information relating to the market for
   the Senior Loan including price quotations for and trading in the Senior Loan
   and interests in similar loans and the market environment and investor
   attitudes towards the Senior Loan and interests in similar loans; (v) the
   experience, reputation, stability and financial condition of the agent and
   any intermediate participant in the loan; and (vi) general economic and
   market conditions affecting the fair value of the Senior Loan. Non-loan
   portfolio holdings (other than short-term obligations, but including listed
   issues) may be valued on the basis of prices furnished by one or more pricing
   services which determine prices for normal, institutional-size trading units
   of such securities using market information, transactions for comparable
   securities and various relationships between securities which are generally
   recognized by institutional traders. In certain circumstances, portfolio
   securities will be valued at the last sales price on the exchange that is the
   primary market for such securities, or the average of the last quoted bid
   price for those securities for which the over-the-counter market is the
   primary market or for listed securities in which there were no sales during
   the day. Marketable securities listed in the NASDAQ National Market System
   are valued at the NASDAQ official closing price. The value of interest rate
   swaps will be based upon a dealer quotation. Short-term obligations which
   mature in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, if their original
   term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was 60 days or less or are valued
   at amortized cost using their value on the 61st day prior to maturity, if
   their original term to maturity when acquired by the Trust was more then 60
   days, unless in each case this is determined not to represent fair value.
   Repurchase agreements are valued at cost plus accrued interest. Other
   portfolio securities for which there are no quotations or valuations are
   valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or on behalf of the
   Trustees.

   B INCOME -- Interest income from Senior Loans is recorded on the accrual
   basis at the then-current interest rate, while all other interest income is
   determined on the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of
   premium or discount. Facility fees received are recognized as income over the
   expected term of the loan. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend
   date for dividends received in cash and/or securities.

   C FEDERAL TAXES -- The Trust's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
   Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to
   distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including any
   net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal
   income or excise tax is necessary. At June 30, 2003, the Trust , for federal
   income tax purposes, had a capital loss carryover of $43,194,563, which will
   expire on June 30, 2009 ($1,925,241), June 30, 2010 ($27,557,475) and June
   30, 2011 ($13,711,847). These amounts will reduce the Trust's taxable income
   arising from future net realized gain on investments, if any , to the extent
   permitted by the Internal Revenue Code and thus will reduce the amount of the
   distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to relieve
   the Trust of any liability for federal income or excise tax.

                                       22
<Page>

   Additionally, at June 30, 2003, the Trust had net capital losses of
   $3,925,789 attributable to security transactions incurred after October 31,
   2002. These are treated as arising on the first day of the Trust's current
   taxable year.

   D EXPENSE REDUCTION -- Investors Bank & Trust Company (IBT) serves as
   custodian of the Trust. Pursuant to the custodian agreement, IBT receives a
   fee reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash
   balances the Trust maintains with IBT. All significant credit balances used
   to reduce the Trust's custodian fees are reported as a reduction of expenses
   on the Statement of Operations.

   E USE OF ESTIMATES -- The preparation of financial statements in conformity
   with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
   requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
   statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during the
   reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   F INDEMNIFICATIONS -- Under the Trust's organizational documents, its
   officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and
   expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund and
   shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for obligations of
   the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters
   into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification
   clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as
   this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have
   not yet occurred.

   G OTHER -- Investment transactions are accounted for on the date the
   investments are purchased or sold. Gains and losses on securities sold are
   determined on the basis of identified cost.

2  AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

   The Trust issued 2,200 shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series A and 2,200
   shares of Auction Preferred Shares Series B on June 27, 2001 in a public
   offering. The underwriting discount and other offering costs were recorded as
   a reduction to paid in capital. Dividends on the APS, which accrue daily, are
   paid cumulative at a rate which was established at the offering of the APS
   and have been reset every 7 days thereafter by an auction. Dividend rates at
   December 31, 2003 were 1.40% and 1.20% for Series A and Series B Shares,
   respectively. Series A and Series B are identical in all respects except for
   the dates of reset for the dividend rates.

   The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust, at a redemption price
   equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on any
   dividend payment date. The APS are also subject to mandatory redemption at a
   redemption price equal to $25,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid
   dividends, if the Trust is in default on its asset maintenance requirements
   with respect to the APS. If the dividends on the APS shall remain unpaid in
   an amount equal to two full years' dividends, the holders of the APS as a
   class have the right to elect a majority of the Board of Trustees. In
   general, the holders of the APS and the common shares have equal voting
   rights of one vote per share, except that the holders of the APS, as a
   separate class, have the right to elect at least two members of the Board of
   Trustees. The APS have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, plus
   accumulated and unpaid dividends. The Trust is required to maintain certain
   asset coverage with respect to the APS as defined in the Trust's By-Laws. The
   Trust pays annual fees equivalent to 0.25% of the preferred shares'
   liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
   auctions.

3  DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS

   The Trust intends to make monthly distributions to common shareholders of net
   investment income, after payment of any dividends on any outstanding
   preferred shares. Distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
   Distributions to preferred shareholders are recorded daily and are payable at
   the end of each dividend period. Each dividend payment period for the Auction
   Preferred Shares is generally seven days. The applicable dividend rate for
   the Auction Preferred Shares on December 31, 2003 was 1.40% and 1.20%, for
   Series A and Series B Shares, respectively. For the six months ended December
   31, 2003, the Trust paid dividends to Auction Preferred shareholders
   amounting to $312,033 and $311,425 for Series A and Series B Shares,
   respectively, representing an average APS dividend rate for such period of
   1.11% and 1.10%, respectively.

4  COMMON SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

   The Agreement and Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an
   unlimited number of full and fractional $0.01 par value common shares of
   beneficial interest. Transactions in common shares were as follows:

5  INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

   The investment adviser fee, computed at a monthly rate of 17/240 of 1% (0.85%
   annually) of the Trust's average weekly gross assets, was earned by EVM as
   compensation for management and investment advisory services rendered to the
   Trust. For the six months ended December 31, 2003, the fee was equivalent to
   0.85% (annualized) of the Trust's average weekly gross assets and amounted to
   $2,264,832. Except for Trustees of the Trust who are not members of EVM's
   organization, officers and Trustees receive remuneration for their services
   to the Trust out of such investment adviser fee. EVM also serves as the
   administrator of the Trust. An administration fee, computed at the monthly
   rate of 1/48 of 1% (0.25% annually) of the average weekly gross assets of the
   Trust, is paid to EVM for managing and administering business affairs of the
   Trust. For the six months ended December 31, 2003, the fee was equivalent to
   0.25% of the Trust's average weekly gross assets for such period and amounted
   to $666,127.

   Certain officers and Trustees of the Trust are officers of the above
   organization.

   During the six months ended December 31, 2003, the Trust engaged in purchase
   transactions with other funds that also utilize EVM, or an affiliate of EVM,
   as an investment adviser. These purchases transactions complied with Rule
   17-a7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and amounted to $2,000,000.

6  INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

   The Trust invests primarily in Senior Loans. The ability of the issuers of
   the Senior Loans held by the Trust to meet their obligations may be affected
   by economic developments in a specific industry. The cost of purchases and
   the proceeds from principal repayments and sales of Senior Loans, corporate
   bonds and equities aggregated $169,739,689 and $197,135,202, respectively,
   for the six months ended December 31, 2003.

7  SHORT-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS

   The Trust has entered into a revolving credit agreement that will allow the
   Trust to borrow $120 million to support the issuance of commercial paper and
   to permit the Trust to invest in accordance with its investment practices.
   Interest is charged under the revolving credit agreement at the bank's base
   rate or at an amount above either the bank's adjusted certificate of deposit
   rate or federal funds effective rate. Interest expense includes commercial
   paper program fees of approximately $169,000 and a commitment fee of
   approximately $92,000 which is computed at the annual rate of 0.15% on the
   unused portion of the revolving credit agreement. There were no significant
   borrowings under this agreement during the period. As of December 31, 2003,
   the Trust had commercial paper outstanding of $93,000,000, at an interest
   rate of 1.07%. Maximum and average borrowings for the six months ended
   December 31, 2003 were $118,000,000 and $110,282,609, respectively, and the
   average interest rate was 1.08%.

8  FEDERAL INCOME TAX BASIS OF UNREALIZED APPRECIATION (DEPRECIATION)

   The cost and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in value of the
   investment securities at December 31, 2003, as computed on a federal income
   tax basis, were as follows:

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

TO THE TRUSTEES AND INVESTORS
OF EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolio of investments, of Eaton Vance Senior Income Trust (the Trust) as
of December 31, 2003, the related statements of operations and cash flows for
the six months then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for the six
months ended December 31, 2003 and for the year ended June 30, 2003, and the
financial highlights for the six months ended December 31, 2003 and for each of
the years in the five-year period ended June 30, 2003. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Trust's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and financial highlights based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities and Senior Loans owned at
December 31, 2003 by correspondence with the custodian, brokers and selling or
agent banks; where replies were not received from brokers and selling or agent
banks, we performed other auditing procedures. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements and financial highlights, referred to
above, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton
Vance Senior Income Trust at December 31, 2003, and the results of its
operations, the changes in its net assets, its cash flows and its financial
highlights for the respective stated periods in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

EATON VANCE SENIOR INCOME TRUST
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

The Trust offers a dividend reinvestment plan (the Plan) pursuant to which
shareholders automatically have dividends and capital gains distributions
reinvested in common shares (the Shares) of the Trust unless they elect
otherwise through their investment dealer. On the distribution payment date, if
the net asset value per Share is equal to or less than the market price per
Share plus estimated brokerage commissions then new Shares will be issued. The
number of Shares shall be determined by the greater of the net asset value per
Share or 95% of the market price. Otherwise, Shares generally will be purchased
on the open market by the Plan Agent. Distributions subject to income tax (if
any) are taxable whether or not shares are reinvested.

If your shares are in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, you
can ask the firm or nominee to participate in the Plan on your behalf. If the
nominee does not offer the Plan, you will need to request that your shares be
re-registered in your name with the Trust's transfer agent, PFPC Inc. or you
will not be able to participate.

The Plan Agent's service fee for handling distributions will be paid by the
Trust. Each participant will be charged their pro rata share of brokerage
commissions on all open-market purchases.

Plan participants may withdraw from the Plan at any time by writing to the Plan
Agent at the address noted on the following page. If you withdraw, you will
receive shares in your name for all Shares credited to your account under the
Plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Agent to have the
Plan Agent sell part or all of his or her Shares and remit the proceeds, the
Plan Agent is authorized to deduct a $5.00 fee plus brokerage commissions from
the proceeds.

If you wish to participate in the Plan and your shares are held in your own
name, you may complete the form on the following page and deliver it to the Plan
Agent.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS

Not required in this filing.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED]

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES

The registrant's Board has adopted a proxy voting policy and procedure (the
"Fund Policy"), pursuant to which the Trustees have delegated proxy voting
responsibility to the registrant's investment adviser and adopted the investment
adviser's proxy voting policies and procedures (the "Policies") which are
described below. The Trustees will review the registrant's proxy voting records
from time to time and will annually consider approving the Policies for the
upcoming year. In the event that a conflict of interest arises between the
registrant's shareholders and the investment adviser, the administrator, or any
of their affiliates or any affiliate of the registrant, the investment adviser
will generally refrain from voting the proxies related to the companies giving
rise to such conflict until it consults with the Board's Special Committee
except as contemplated under the Fund Policy. The Special Committee will
instruct the investment adviser on the appropriate course of action.

The Policies are designed to promote accountability of a company's management to
its shareholders and to align the interests of management with those
shareholders. The investment adviser will generally support company management
on proposals relating to environmental and social policy issues and on matters
regarding the state of organization of the company. On all other matters, the
investment adviser will take management's proposals under advisement but will
consider each matter in light of the guidelines set forth in the Policies.
Except in the instance of routine matters related to corporate administration
which are not expected to have a significant economic impact on the company or
its shareholders (on which the investment adviser will routinely vote with
management), the investment adviser will review each matter on a case-by-case
basis and reserves the right to deviate from the Policies guidelines when it
believes the situation warrants such a deviation. The Policy includes voting
guidelines for matters relating to, among other things, the election of
directors, approval of independent auditors, executive compensation, corporate
structure and anti-takeover defenses. The investment

<Page>

adviser may abstain from voting from time to time where it determines that the
costs associated with voting a proxy outweighs the benefits derived from
exercising the right to vote.

In addition, the investment adviser will monitor situations that may result in a
conflict of interest between the registrant's shareholders and the investment
adviser, the administrator, or any of their affiliates or any affiliate of the
registrant by maintaining a list of significant existing and prospective
corporate clients. The investment adviser's personnel responsible for reviewing
and voting proxies on behalf of the registrant will report any proxy received or
expected to be received from a company included on that list to the investment
adviser's general counsel or chief equity investment officer. The general
counsel or chief equity investment officer will determine if a conflict exists.
If a conflict does exist, the proxy will either be voted strictly in accordance
with the Policy or the investment adviser will seek instruction on how to vote
from the Board.

Effective August 31, 2004, information on how the registrant voted proxies
relating to portfolio securities during the 12 month period ended June 30, 2004
will be available (1) without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122,
and (2) on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at
http://www.sec.gov.
