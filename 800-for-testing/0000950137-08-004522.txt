PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED REPRESENTS PAST PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS NO GUARANTEE OF
FUTURE RESULTS, AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE MAY BE LOWER OR HIGHER THAN THE FIGURES
SHOWN. FOR THE MOST RECENT MONTH-END PERFORMANCE FIGURES, PLEASE VISIT
VANKAMPEN.COM OR SPEAK WITH YOUR FINANCIAL ADVISOR. INVESTMENT RETURNS AND
PRINCIPAL VALUE WILL FLUCTUATE AND TRUST SHARES, WHEN REDEEMED, MAY BE WORTH
MORE OR LESS THAN THEIR ORIGINAL COST.

The NAV per share is determined by dividing the value of the Trust's portfolio
securities, cash and other assets, less all liabilities and preferred shares, by
the total number of common shares outstanding. The common share market price is
the price the market is willing to pay for shares of the trust at a given time.
Common share market price is influenced by a range of factors, including supply
and demand and market conditions. Total return assumes an investment at the
beginning of the period, reinvestment of all distributions for the period in
accordance with the trust's dividend reinvestment plan, and sale of all shares
at the end of the period.

Trust Report

FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2008

MARKET CONDITIONS

U.S. economic growth, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), rose 4.9
percent in the third quarter of 2007, well above the 3.8 percent posted during
the second quarter. However, advance estimates at the end of the reporting
period show GDP expanded just 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter. The economic
slowdown translated into slower earnings growth for many corporate borrowers
within the senior loan market.

The six-month period under review was challenging for the senior loan market, as
it was for virtually all non-government bond sectors. The turmoil and
uncertainty that began in early summer persisted throughout the period as
dislocations stemming from the problems in the subprime mortgage arena permeated
the fixed income markets, leading to a significant contraction in credit and
liquidity. In an effort to spur the economy and ease the liquidity crunch, the
Federal Open Market Committee (the "Fed") lowered the target federal funds rate
a total of 2.25 percentage points during the reporting period, bringing the rate
to 3.00 percent as of the end of January. Although the Fed's moves did bring
some stability to the markets, it was relatively short-lived and riskier assets
continued to struggle as investors fled to high-quality securities.

The broad reassessment of risk pricing in the credit markets, coupled with the
significant decline in market liquidity, put considerable pressure on senior
loan prices. Although the market experienced a brief respite in September and
October, when loan values rose, a subsequent significant decline in demand and
rise in supply pushed loan values lower again. Demand for collateralized loan
obligations (CLOs) in particular, which had until recently accounted for up to
60 percent of purchases in the senior loan market, evaporated almost entirely in
the latter half of the year. At the same time, following the run up of prices in
October, a significant amount of new deals were launched. This technical
demand/supply imbalance in the market, coupled with the tightening of lending
standards, have in our view been the primary drivers of the volatility in the
senior loan market over the past several months. Increased selling by retail and
relative value investors has also pressured loan prices. Nonetheless, default
rates remain well below the historical average, though they have trended upward
slightly in recent weeks, and the overall fundamentals of the senior loan
market, in our opinion remain intact.

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

The Trust's return can be calculated based upon either the market price or the
net asset value (NAV) of its shares. NAV per share is determined by dividing the
value of the Trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all
liabilities and preferred shares, by the total number of common shares
outstanding, while market price reflects the supply and demand for the shares.
As a result, the two returns can differ, as they did during the reporting
period. For the six months ended January 31, 2008, the Trust returned -11.47%
percent on a market price basis and -7.68% percent on an NAV basis.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of
future results, and current performance may be lower or higher than the figures
shown. Investment return, net asset value and common share market price will
fluctuate and Trust shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their
original cost. See Performance Summary for additional performance information.

Although the past several months have certainly been challenging for investors,
we have not seen a meaningful decline in the credit quality of the portfolio and
we continue to see relatively strong earnings from the companies in which we
have invested. We continue to adhere to our research-intensive investment
process, employing a bottom-up asset selection process driven by thorough
analysis of individual company fundamentals, and have not relaxed our rigorous
credit standards. In fact, our team refused to participate in over 65 percent of
all the deals that were syndicated during 2006 and 2007, when a number of highly
leveraged, aggressively structured senior loans were syndicated. We believe this
has contributed to the Trust's very low default rate, which was at an all-time
low for the Trust at the end of 2007 and well below the industry average. We do
think that defaults in the senior loan market are likely to rise in the coming
months, but we believe the deals that we turned down are the ones most likely to
experience problems should the economy continue to decline.

We continued to position the portfolio defensively, generally avoiding sectors
or industries that we believe are vulnerable to cyclical economic downturns. For
example, we remain cautious about auto and airline industries because of their
susceptibility to high fuel prices. Given the decline in the residential housing
market, we have also generally avoided investments in the building and real
estate sectors. We have been very selective regarding investments in the health
care industry, particularly those assets with inherent reimbursement and
regulatory risks, but have found pockets of attractive opportunities in sub-
sectors that are not exposed to these risks. In general, we made relatively few
changes to the portfolio, and as of the end of the reporting period, the Trust's

                                                                               3

largest sector weightings were printing and publishing, healthcare, and
beverage, food and tobacco.

The Trust remained fully invested in senior secured loans, and used a modest
amount of leverage which may allow us to enhance the Trust's yield while keeping
credit standards high. Leverage involves borrowing at a floating short-term rate
and reinvesting the proceeds at a higher rate. Unlike other fixed-income asset
classes, using leverage in conjunction with senior loans does not involve the
same degree of risk from rising short-term interest rates since the income from
senior loans adjusts to changes in interest rates, as do the rates which
determine the Trust's borrowing costs. (Similarly, should short-term rates fall,
borrowing costs would also decline. Of course, the fund's portfolio, though,
also will generate less income when interest rates decline.) We might reduce
leverage in periods of weaker credit quality conditions to prevent magnifying
erosion of the Trust's net asset value.

While we believe this portfolio structure (fully invested, modest leverage) adds
value for shareholders over a full cycle, it has been a drag on performance in
the short term. Because the recent market volatility has been driven by
technical factors, rather than a change in underlying fundamentals, we have not
altered the use of leverage in the Trust as we believe it is very difficult to
"time" technical events in the market. The use of leverage may, though, increase
the Fund's volatility. Therefore, portfolio construction continues to be driven
by fundamental credit research.

Although it has been a very difficult period, it has created certain
opportunities. Loans coming to market today are offering better spreads and
stronger credit structures than we have seen in the past few years. These more
investor-friendly terms may lead to attractive risk/reward characteristics for
investors going forward. In addition, merger and acquisition activity continues,
which has historically meant greater opportunities for senior secured lenders.
The emergence of a large number of non-public funds seeking to acquire portions
of loans currently held by banks is encouraging as well, as it may serve to
reduce the supply overhang and therefore relieve some of the downward pressure
on prices in the market. We will continue to focus on maintaining a high
quality, portfolio of issuers with stable cash flows and strong management
teams.

The Trust's procedure for reinvesting all dividends and distributions in common
shares is through purchases in the open market. This method helps support the
market value of the Trust's shares. In addition, we would like to remind you
that the Trustees have approved a procedure whereby the Trust may, when
appropriate, purchase shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions at a price not above market value or net asset value, whichever is
lower at the time of purchase.

There is no guarantee that any sectors mentioned will continue to perform as
discussed herein or that securities in such sectors will be held by the Trust in
the future.

       to shareholders and makes available through the Van Kampen public Web

       SEC for the trust's first and third fiscal quarters on Form N-Q. Van

       quarters to shareholders, nor are the reports posted to the Van Kampen

       as the Form N-CSR and N-CSRS filings) by accessing the SEC's Web site,

(c) This borrower has filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court.

(d) Payment-in-kind security.

(e) This borrower is currently in liquidation.

(f) Variable rate security. Interest rate shown is that in effect at January 31,
    2008.

(g) 144A-Private Placement security which is exempt from registration under Rule
    144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This security may only be
    resold in transactions exempt from registration which are normally those
    transactions with qualified institutional buyers.

(h) Non-income producing security as the stock or warrant currently does not
    declare income dividends.

(i) Restricted security. Securities were acquired through the restructuring of
    senior loans. These securities are restricted as they are not allowed to be
    deposited via the Depository Trust Company. If at a later point in time, the
    company wishes to register, the issuer will bear the costs associated with
    registration. The aggregate value of restricted securities represents less
    than 0.1% of the net assets applicable to common shares of the Trust.

*   Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio generally are subject to mandatory
    and/or optional prepayment. Because of these mandatory prepayment conditions
    and because there may be significant economic incentives for a Borrower to
    prepay, prepayments of Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio may occur. As a
    result, the actual remaining maturity of Senior Loans held in the Trust's
    portfolio may be substantially less than the stated maturities shown.
    Although the Trust is unable to accurately estimate the actual remaining
    maturity of individual Senior Loans, the Trust estimates that the actual
    average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its portfolio will be
    approximately 18-24 months.

**  Senior Loans in which the Trust invests generally pay interest at rates
    which are periodically redetermined by reference to a base lending rate plus
    a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending rate
    offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London Inter-Bank
    Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or more major
    United States banks or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate. Senior Loans
    are generally considered to be restricted in that the Trust ordinarily is
    contractually obligated to receive approval from the Agent Bank and/or
    Borrower prior to the disposition of a Senior Loan.

VAN KAMPEN SENIOR INCOME TRUST

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2008 (UNAUDITED)

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Van Kampen Senior Income Trust (the "Trust") is registered as a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "1940 Act"), as amended. The Trust's investment objective is to seek
to provide a high level of current income, consistent with preservation of
capital. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a
portfolio of interests in floating or variable rate senior loans to
corporations, partnerships and other entities which operate in a variety of
industries and geographical regions. The Trust borrows money for investment
purposes which will create the opportunity for enhanced return, but also should
be considered a speculative technique and may increase the Trust's volatility.
The Trust commenced investment operations on June 23, 1998.

    The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. SECURITY VALUATION The Trust's Senior Loans and notes are valued by the Trust
following valuation guidelines established and periodically reviewed by the
Trust's Board of Trustees. Under the valuation guidelines, Senior Loans and
notes for which reliable market quotes are readily available are valued at the
mean of such bid and ask quotes. Where reliable market quotes are not readily
available, Senior Loans and notes are valued, where possible, using independent
market indicators provided by independent pricing sources approved by the Board
of Trustees. Other Senior Loans and notes are valued by independent pricing
sources approved by the Board of Trustees based upon pricing models developed,
maintained and operated by those pricing sources or valued by Van Kampen Asset
Management (the "Adviser") by considering a number of factors including
consideration of market indicators, transactions in instruments which the
Adviser believes may be comparable (including comparable credit quality,
interest rate, interest rate redetermination period and maturity), the credit
worthiness of the Borrower, the current interest rate, the period until next
interest rate redetermination and the maturity of such Senior Loan.
Consideration of comparable instruments may include commercial paper, negotiable
certificates of deposit and short-term variable rate securities which have
adjustment periods comparable to the Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio. The
fair value of Senior Loans are reviewed and approved by the Trust's Valuation
Committee and the Board of Trustees.

    Credit default swaps are valued using market quotations obtained from
brokers.

    Equity securities are valued on the basis of prices furnished by pricing
services or as determined in good faith by the Adviser under the direction of
the Board of Trustees.

    Short-term securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Short-term loan
participations are valued at cost in the absence of any indication of
impairment.

B. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date
basis. Realized gains and losses are determined on an identified cost basis.
Legal expenditures that are

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

expected to result in the restructuring of a plan of reorganization for an
investment are recorded as realized losses. The Trust may purchase and sell
securities on a "when-issued" or "delayed delivery" basis, with settlement to
occur at a later date. The value of the security so purchased is subject to
market fluctuations during this period. The Trust will segregate assets with the
custodian having an aggregate value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued or delayed delivery purchase commitments until payment is made. At
January 31, 2008, the Trust had no when-issued or delayed delivery purchase
commitments.

    The Trust may invest in repurchase agreements, which are short-term
investments in which the Trust acquires ownership of a debt security and the
seller agrees to repurchase the security at a future time and specified price.
Repurchase agreements are fully collateralized by the underlying debt security.
The Trust will make payment for such securities only upon physical delivery or
evidence of book entry transfer to the account of the custodian bank. The seller
is required to maintain the value of the underlying security at not less than
the repurchase proceeds due the Trust.

C. INVESTMENT INCOME Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date and
interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Facility fees received are
treated as market discounts. Market premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted over the stated life of each applicable senior loan, note, or other
fixed income security. Other income is comprised primarily of amendment fees
which are recorded when received. Amendment fees are earned as compensation for
agreeing to changes in loan agreements.

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES It is the Trust's policy to comply with the requirements
of Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies and to distribute substantially all of its taxable income to its
shareholders. Therefore, no provision for federal income taxes is required. The
Trust adopted the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") Interpretation No. 48 ("FIN 48") Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes on January 31, 2008. FIN 48 sets forth a minimum threshold for financial
statement recognition of the benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. The implementation of FIN 48 did not result in any
unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements. If
applicable, the Trust recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax
benefits in "Interest Expense" and penalties in "Other" expenses on the
Statement of Operations. The Trust files tax returns with the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service and various states. Generally, each of the tax years in the four
year period ended July 31, 2007, remains subject to examination by taxing
authorities.

    The Trust intends to utilize provisions of the federal income tax laws which
allow it to carry a realized capital loss forward for eight years following the
year of the loss and offset such losses against any future realized capital
gains. At July 31, 2007, the Trust had an accumulated capital loss carryforward
for tax purposes of $230,073,119 which will expire according to the following
schedule.

E. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND GAINS The Trust intends to declare and pay monthly
dividends from net investment income to common shareholders. Net realized gains,
if any, are distributed at least annually to common shareholders. Distributions
from net realized gains for book purposes may include short-term capital gains,
which are included as ordinary income for tax purposes.

    The tax character of distributions paid for the year ended July 31, 2007
were as follows:

    As of July 31, 2007, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis
were as follows:

Undistributed ordinary income...............................  $948,827
</Table>

    Net realized gains or losses may differ for financial reporting and tax
purposes primarily as a result of the deferral of losses resulting from wash
sale transactions.

2. INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Under the terms of the Trust's Investment Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will
provide investment advice and facilities to the Trust for an annual fee of .85%
of the average daily managed assets. Managed assets are defined as the gross
asset value of the Trust minus the sum of accrued liabilities, other than the
aggregate amount of borrowings undertaken by the Trust. In addition, the Trust
will pay a monthly administrative fee to Van Kampen Investments Inc., the
Trust's Administrator, at an annual rate of .20% of the average daily managed
assets of the Trust. The administrative services provided by the Administrator
include monitoring the provisions of the loan agreements and any agreements with
respect to participations and assignments, record keeping responsibilities with
respect to interests in Variable Rate Senior Loans in the Trust's portfolio and
providing certain services to the holders of the Trust's securities.

    For the six months ended January 31, 2008, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $69,600 representing legal services provided by Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, of which a trustee of the Trust is a partner of such
firm and he and his law firm provide legal services as legal counsel to the
Trust.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

    Under separate Legal Services and Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) Employment
agreements, the Adviser provides legal services and the CCO provides compliance
services to the Trust. The costs of these services are allocated to each trust.
For the six months ended January 31, 2008, the Trust recognized expenses of
approximately $46,500 representing Van Kampen Investments Inc.'s or its
affiliates' (collectively "Van Kampen") cost of providing legal services to the
Trust, as well as the salary, benefits and related costs of the CCO and related
support staff paid by Van Kampen. Services provided pursuant to the Legal
Services agreement are reported as part of "Professional Fees" on the Statement
of Operations. Services provided pursuant to the CCO Employment agreement are
reported as part of "Accounting and Administrative Expenses" on the Statement of
Operations.

    Certain officers and trustees of the Trust are also officers and directors
of Van Kampen. The Trust does not compensate its officers or trustees who are
also officers of Van Kampen.

    The Trust provides deferred compensation and retirement plans for its
trustees who are not officers of Van Kampen. Under the deferred compensation
plan, trustees may elect to defer all or a portion of their compensation to a
later date. Benefits under the retirement plan are payable upon retirement for a
ten-year period and are based upon each trustee's years of service to the Trust.
The maximum annual benefit per trustee under the plan is $2,500.

    As of January 31, 2008, the Trust did not own shares of affiliated
companies. Affiliated companies are defined by the 1940 Act, as amended, as
those companies in which a fund holds 5% or more of the outstanding voting
securities.

depreciation on these commitments of $5,714,582

                                                                              39

as of January 31, 2008 is reported as "Unfunded Commitments" on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.

5. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

A derivative financial instrument in very general terms refers to a security
whose value is "derived" from the value of an underlying asset, reference rate
or index.

    The Trust may use derivative instruments for a variety of reasons, such as
to attempt to protect the Trust against possible changes in the market value of
its portfolio or to generate potential gain. All of the Trust's portfolio
holdings, including derivative instruments, are marked to market each day with
the change in value reflected in unrealized appreciation/depreciation. Risks may
arise as a result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts.

    The Trust may enter into credit default swap contracts for hedging purposes
or to gain exposure to a credit in which the Trust may otherwise invest. A
credit default swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit
risk of an issuer. A buyer of a credit default swap is said to buy protection by
paying periodic fees in return for a contingent payment from the seller if the
issuer has a credit event such as bankruptcy, a failure to pay outstanding
obligations or deteriorating credit while the swap is outstanding. A seller of a
credit default swap is said to sell protection and thus collects the periodic
fees and profits if the credit of the issuer remains stable or improves while
the swap is outstanding but the seller in a credit default swap contract would
be required to pay an agreed-upon amount, which approximates the notional amount
of the swap as disclosed in the table following the Portfolio of Investments, to
the buyer in the event of an adverse credit event of the issuer. The Trust
accrues for the periodic fees on credit default swaps on a daily basis with the
net amount accrued recorded within unrealized appreciation/depreciation of swap
contracts. Upon cash settlement of the periodic fees, the net amount is recorded
as realized gain/loss on swap contracts on the Statements of Operations. Net
unrealized gains are recorded as an asset or net unrealized losses are reported
as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The change in value
of the swap contracts is reported as unrealized gains or losses on the Statement
of Operations. Payments received or made upon entering into a credit default
swap contract, if any, are recorded as realized gain or loss on the Statement of
Operations upon termination or maturity of the swap. Credit default swaps may
involve greater risks than if the Trust had invested in the issuer directly.
Credit default swaps are subject to general market risk, counterparty risk and
credit risk.

    If there is a default by the counterparty, the Trust will have contractual
remedies pursuant to the agreements related to the transaction. Counterparties
are required to pledge collateral daily (based on the valuation of each swap) on
behalf of the Trust with a value approximately equal to the amount of any
unrealized gain. Cash collateral, when received by the Trust, is recorded with
an offsetting liability shown on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Reciprocally, when the Trust has an unrealized loss on swap contract, the Trust
has instructed the custodian to pledge cash or liquid securities as collateral
with a value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss.
Collateral pledges are monitored and subsequently adjusted if and when the swap
valuations fluctuate. Restricted cash, if any, for segregating purposes is shown
on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

6. SENIOR LOAN PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS

The Trust invests primarily in participations, assignments, or acts as a party
to the primary lending syndicate of a Variable Rate Senior Loan interest to
United States and foreign corporations, partnerships, and other entities. When
the Trust purchases a participation of a Senior Loan interest, the Trust
typically enters into a contractual agreement with the lender or other third
party selling the participation, but not with the borrower directly. As such,
the Trust assumes the credit risk of the borrower, selling participant or other
persons interpositioned between the Trust and the borrower.

    At January 31, 2008, the following sets forth the selling participants with
respect to interests in Senior Loans purchased by the Trust on a participation
basis.

7. BORROWINGS

The Trust may utilize financial leverage to the maximum extent allowable under
the 1940 Act, as amended. Under the 1940 Act, as amended, a Trust generally may
not (i) borrow money greater than 33 1/3% of the Trust's total assets or (ii)
issue preferred shares greater than 50% of the Trust's total assets. In using a
combination of borrowing money and issuing preferred shares, the maximum
allowable leverage is somewhere between 33 1/3% and 50% (but in no event more
than 50%) of the Trust's total assets based on the relative amounts borrowed or
preferred shares issued.

    The Trust has entered into a $700 million revolving credit and security
agreement. This revolving credit agreement is secured by the assets of the
Trust. In connection with this agreement, for the six months ended January 31,
2008, the Trust incurred fees of approximately $1,024,427. For the six months
ended January 31, 2008, the average daily balance of borrowings under the
Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Security Agreement was $415,744,565
with a weighted average interest rate of 5.42%.

8. PREFERRED SHARES ISSUANCE

The Trust has outstanding 5,600 shares each of Series M, Series T, Series W,
Series TH and Series F Auction Preferred Shares (APS), $.01 Par Value, $25,000
liquidation preference, for a total issuance of $700 million. Dividends are
cumulative and the dividend rates are generally reset every seven days through
an auction process. If the preferred shares are unable to be remarketed on a
remarketing date, the Trust would be required to pay the maximum applicable rate
on APS to holders of such shares for successive divided periods until such time
when the shares are successfully remarketed. The maximum rate on APS is equal to
150% of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) on that date. The average
rate in

                                                                              41

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- JANUARY 31, 2008 (UNAUDITED) continued

effect on January 31, 2008 was 4.464%. During the six months ended January 31,
2008, the rates ranged from 4.360% to 6.300%.

    The Trust pays annual fees equivalent to .25% of the preferred share
liquidation value for the remarketing efforts associated with the preferred
auctions. These fees are included as a component of the "Preferred Share
Maintenance" expense on the Statement of Operations.

    The APS are redeemable at the option of the Trust in whole or in part at the
liquidation value of $25,000 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.
The Trust is subject to certain asset coverage tests and the APS are subject to
mandatory redemption if the tests are not met.

9. INDEMNIFICATIONS

The Trust enters into contracts that contain a variety of indemnifications. The
Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown. However, the Trust
has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

10. ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements (SFAS 157), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. As of January 31, 2008, the Adviser does not believe the adoption
of SFAS 157 will impact the amounts reported in the financial statements,
however, additional disclosures will be required about the inputs used to
develop the measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements
reported on the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.

11. SUBSEQUENT EVENT--AUCTION PREFERRED SHARES (APS)

Beginning on February 12, 2008 and continuing through March 18, 2008 (the most
recent auction prior to the printing of this report), the following series of
preferred shares of the Trust were not successfully remarketed. As a result, the
dividend rates of these preferred shares were reset to the maximum applicable
rate on APS.
