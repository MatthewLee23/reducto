<S>                         <C>
                            Franklin Templeton's distinct multi-manager
                            structure combines the specialized expertise of
                            three world-class investment management
                            groups--Franklin, Templeton and Mutual Series.

SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE       Each of our portfolio management groups operates
                            autonomously, relying on its own research and
                            staying true to the unique investment disciplines
                            that underlie its success.

                            FRANKLIN. Founded in 1947, Franklin is a recognized
                            leader in fixed income investing and also brings
                            expertise in growth- and value-style U.S. equity
                            investing.

                            TEMPLETON. Founded in 1940, Templeton pioneered
                            international investing and, in 1954, launched what
                            has become the industry's oldest global fund. Today,
                            with offices in over 25 countries, Templeton offers
                            investors a truly global perspective.

                            MUTUAL SERIES. Founded in 1949, Mutual Series is
                            dedicated to a unique style of value investing,
                            searching aggressively for opportunity among what it
                            believes are undervalued stocks, as well as
                            arbitrage situations and distressed securities.

TRUE DIVERSIFICATION        Because our management groups work independently and
                            adhere to different investment approaches, Franklin,
                            Templeton and Mutual Series funds typically have
                            distinct portfolios. That's why our funds can be
                            used to build truly diversified allocation plans
                            covering every major asset class.

RELIABILITY YOU CAN TRUST   At Franklin Templeton Investments, we seek to
                            consistently provide investors with exceptional
                            risk-adjusted returns over the long term, as well as
                            the reliable, accurate and personal service that has
                            helped us become one of the most trusted names in
                            financial services.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW

For the 12 months under review, Templeton Global Income Fund had cumulative
total returns of +20.48% based on market price and +17.55% based on net asset
value. The Fund outperformed the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Global Government Bond Index
(GGBI), which had cumulative total returns of +6.81% in local currency terms and
+10.39% in U.S. dollar terms for the same period.(1) You can find the Fund's
long-term performance data in the Performance Summary on page 8.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET OVERVIEW

The year under review consisted of two distinct halves. In the first half, the
U.S. recession spread throughout the world as the financial crisis intensified,
with economic activity and security prices falling sharply. Frozen credit
markets and depressed consumer sentiment levels caused a steep drop in economic
activity despite policymakers' best efforts. In addition to continued global
interest rate easing, the U.S., eurozone and the U.K. implemented quantitative
and credit easing policies, and governments worldwide boosted fiscal stimuli to
counter the deepening global recession. Partially as a result of this
coordinated global response, investor confidence began to improve in March,
which gradually benefited economic activity through the increased flow of
credit, especially in interbank lending and trade financing. Strong economic
activity in China, the unfreezing of credit markets and the G20 meeting in April
also gave investors confidence.(2) The turnaround led to a more favorable
outlook that benefited the global economy through a shift in the inventory
adjustment cycle and better corporate bond and equity market performance. Many
investors appeared to believe the worst of the financial crisis was over, and by
the end of the period there was substantial evidence that an economic recovery
was under way. Greater risk appetite in the second half of the year benefited
currency and developing bond markets as investors' outlook on the economy
improved. Although financial markets and economic activity improved
significantly from their very low levels, relative to the prior year, economic
activity remained weak as deleveraging continued, global trade contracted and
unemployment rose.

<PAGE>

Inflation fell during the period as weak global growth led to lower prices for
commodities, and slackening labor and capital markets pushed most other prices
down gradually. Monetary easing in the eurozone continued, although at a slower
pace than many economists would have preferred, given the recession's depth and
lesser fiscal policy action compared with those of the U.S. In the first half of
2009 compared with the first half of 2008 (year-over-year), the eurozone's gross
domestic product (GDP) contracted 4.8%, which was greater than the U.S.
economy's 3.7% contraction.(3) Outside the eurozone, the economic slowdown was
more severe in many emerging European countries. Central and eastern Europe was
one of the regions most damaged by the financial crisis as it exposed those
countries' external imbalances characterized by large foreign borrowing to
finance substantial current account deficits. Several countries including
Ukraine, Hungary and Latvia sought help from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF). Even Poland, which was in a comparatively strong position relative to its
regional peers, took advantage of the IMF's new, prequalified loan facility,
though it did not draw on these resources.

In Asia, growth differed significantly between large economies with higher
domestic demand and small economies more dependent on exports. The large
economies, particularly China, India and Indonesia, were more resistant to the
global recession as aggressive fiscal and monetary responses outweighed
declining exports. Within these three countries, domestic demand was resilient
and accounts for a bigger share of these economies. In contrast, the smaller
economies suffered quick, severe downturns as their reliance on demand for
exports made them very vulnerable to the global downturn. Exemplifying this
dependence, production dropped more than export demand, allowing inventories to
fall to levels more in line with reduced global consumption. However, even some
of these very badly affected economies showed signs of improvement toward
period-end. On the other hand, the Japanese economy was the weakest among the
large, developed economies. GDP contracted an average of 6.5% year-over-year
during the past three quarters due to subdued consumption, weak external demand
and lackluster government spending.(4) Japan's trade balance worsened as the
global recession and difficulties in obtaining credit negatively impacted
machinery exports, an important sector for the economy.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

We invest selectively in bonds around the world to generate income for the Fund,
seeking opportunities while monitoring changes in interest rates, currency
exchange rates and credit risks.

WHAT IS A CURRENT ACCOUNT?

A current account is that part of the balance of payments where all of one
country's international transactions in goods and services are recorded.

WHAT IS BALANCE OF PAYMENTS?

Balance of payments is a record of all of a country's exports and imports of
goods and services, borrowing and lending with the rest of the world during a
particular time period. It helps a country evaluate its competitive strengths
and weaknesses and forecast the strength of its currency.

WHAT IS DURATION?

Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity to interest rate changes. In
general, a portfolio of securities with a lower duration can be expected to be
less sensitive to interest rate changes than a portfolio with a higher duration.

WHAT IS A CARRY TRADE?

Carry trade is a strategy in which an investor sells a certain currency with a
relatively low interest rate and uses the funds to purchase a different currency
yielding a higher interest rate. A trader using this strategy attempts to
capture the difference between the rates.

MANAGER'S DISCUSSION

The Fund's total return was influenced by various factors, including interest
rate developments, currency movements and exposure to sovereign debt markets.

INTEREST RATE STRATEGY

The Fund added duration exposure early in the period in countries where yields
lagged the rally in developed government bond markets. Although deteriorating
growth outlooks caused U.S. and eurozone treasuries to rally, delayed central
bank rate cuts and investor risk aversion kept yields higher in developing
government bond markets. In our view, this created an opportunity for the Fund
to benefit if developing countries lowered interest rates similar to developed
markets later in the period. Overall, the Fund's interest rate exposure was
marginally positive for relative performance as the negative effect from being
underweighted in U.K. and eurozone bonds was outweighed by select duration
positioning. Among key interest rate positions that benefited performance, South
Korea and Indonesia stood out in Asia as our large positions benefited from
central bank easing. Another similar example was Chile where policymakers made
aggressive interest rate cuts to counteract the severe decline in economic
activity, which benefited the Fund's duration exposure. The Fund marginally
benefited from its underweighted U.S. Treasury allocation as yields rose toward
the end of the Fund's fiscal year after an initial rally. Toward period-end, the
Fund reduced duration exposure in select economies where yields fell to
historically low levels.

CURRENCY STRATEGY

The Fund's diversified currency exposure benefited relative performance.
Currency markets performed very differently between the first and second halves
of the year. Deleveraging, hedging currency risk and risk aversion led the U.S.
dollar to strengthen against most currencies during the beginning of the year,
but in the second half it lost those gains. For the period as a whole, the
trade-weighted dollar rose 4.35% despite falling 10.23% from its peak in early
March.(5) Weak U.S. domestic demand helped the current account deficit moderate
during the year. This was enhanced by better terms of trade due to the
significant drop in commodity prices. Despite this improvement, the dollar
remained weak as investors focused on challenges the economy would likely face
in financing the growing fiscal deficit, the weaker outlook for growth and loose
monetary policy. Outside the U.S., the Fund benefited from exposure to the
Mexican peso. The contrast between the first and second halves of the year was
evident in the behavior of the peso. It fell 33.13% against the dollar to reach
its all-time low.(6) However, the Fund's

<PAGE>

local market bond position was hedged during the period and so the poor
performance did not adversely affect the Fund. As this occurred, and the peso
was trading at distressed levels, we unhedged the bond position. Although the
Mexican economy faced significant challenges, we viewed valuations at the height
of the crisis as reflecting a more dire outlook than we believed would likely
unfold. The Fund benefited from its focus on underlying fundamentals as the
Mexican peso appreciated 13.2% during the second half of the year.(6)

Among Asian currencies, the Fund benefited from its overweighted exposures to
the Indonesian rupiah and the South Korean won. We added to both positions
significantly following a sell-off that occurred early in the year and therefore
benefited significantly as these currencies appreciated 18.9% and 22.8% in the
second half of the year.(6) Although the Japanese yen was one of the Fund's
largest currency exposures, our underweighted exposure to the yen detracted from
relative performance, as it was one of the few currencies that appreciated
strongly against the dollar for the period as a whole. Once again, differences
between the first and second halves of the year were evident as the Fund held a
large exposure to the yen that helped absolute performance throughout the first
half of the year, benefiting from the rise in risk aversion as carry trades
unwound and domestic investors repatriated international investments. However,
in the second half of the year, we became wary of the yen's more expensive
valuation as the economic outlook for Japan remained quite challenging. We
reduced our exposure and even put on a net negative position at the very end of
the period as a way to hedge against the risk of rising yields in the U.S. since
such an increase would likely cause the interest rate differential to shift in
the U.S.'s favor, which historically has a high correlation with the dollar
strengthening against the yen. The Fund's underweighted New Zealand dollar and
Singapore dollar exposures also detracted from relative performance while the
Fund's Chinese yuan position helped the Fund. The net negative positions in the
New Zealand and Singapore dollars were added because of expensive valuations
relative to underlying fundamentals and as a hedge for the broader portfolio
against a possible return of risk aversion. We continued to find several of the
region's currencies attractive as relative growth and healthier fiscal and
external balances should benefit them relative to the currencies of the
leveraged developed world.

The euro ended the period close to the level where it began, depreciating 2.5%
for the 12 months under review.(6) However, it was still one of the largest
contributors to the Fund's relative performance because we positioned the Fund
correctly for the weakness in the first half of the year followed by strength in
the second. The Fund started its fiscal year very underweighted in the euro and

benefited from the currency's continued fall from its all-time high in April
2008. However, we significantly reduced our net negative position toward the
middle of the period when we viewed the euro as being at fair value against the
dollar. We continued to prefer exposure to non-euro European currencies given
what we believed were better valuations and better growth dynamics. However, the
Swedish krona and Norwegian krone fell 9.6% and 9.8% against the U.S. dollar
over the period and detracted from relative performance.(6) The Fund's
overweighted exposure to the Egyptian pound and underweighted allocation to the
British pound benefited relative performance, while the Fund's exposure to the
Russian ruble detracted after the currency was allowed to weaken against its
dual currency basket (45% euros and 55% U.S. dollars).

GLOBAL SOVEREIGN DEBT AND CREDIT STRATEGY

The Fund purchased investment-grade and lower-rated sovereign debt that
typically compensates for greater credit risk by offering higher yields relative
to U.S. and European benchmark Treasury securities. Improved risk appetite
benefited high yield products during the second half of the period, particularly
sovereign bonds, following the G20 summit in April 2009. It was decided at the
summit that the IMF would receive additional resources, and the IMF eased
conditions to help countries in need of balance of payments support or access to
liquidity. U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market debt posted a +5.37% total
return during the period as measured by the J.P. Morgan (JPM) Emerging Markets
Bond Index Global (EMBIG), but the Fund's return was even stronger as it added
exposure to sovereign bonds following the initial sell-off.(7) The index fell
28.83% from the beginning of the period to its low in late October, and rose
48.05% from that point to the end of the period.(7) Our analysis indicated that
sovereign spreads were at distressed levels, reflecting a higher probability of
default than we thought was appropriate. In our opinion, most emerging market
sovereign bonds were in much better positions than in previous crises and
unlikely to suffer to the same extent as they have in the past. Despite these
fundamentals, forced and panicked selling hit sovereign bonds, and so we sought
to capitalize on this market inefficiency by adding exposure. Sovereign interest
rate credit spreads fell 325 basis points from their peak in mid-March as most
emerging economies were fairly well positioned entering the crisis.(8)
Regionally, Latin American sovereign debt had a +2.19% total return, Asian debt
a +11.77% total return and central and eastern European debt a +5.70% total
return.(7)

Performance Summary as of 8/31/09

Your dividend income will vary depending on dividends or interest paid by
securities in the Fund's portfolio, adjusted for operating expenses. Capital
gain distributions are net profits realized from the sale of portfolio
securities. Total return reflects reinvestment of the Fund's dividends and
capital gain distributions, if any, and any unrealized gains or losses. Total
returns do not reflect any sales charges paid at inception or brokerage
commissions paid on secondary market purchases. The performance table does not
reflect any taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund dividends, capital gains
distributions, if any, or any realized gains on the sale of Fund shares.

ENDNOTES

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WILL AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO AND ITS
SHARE PRICE AND YIELD. BOND PRICES GENERALLY MOVE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF
INTEREST RATES. THUS, AS PRICES OF BONDS IN THE FUND ADJUST TO A RISE IN
INTERESTS RATES, THE FUND'S SHARE PRICE MAY DECLINE. SPECIAL RISKS ARE
ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN INVESTING, INCLUDING CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, ECONOMIC
INSTABILITY AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS. INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPING MARKETS
INVOLVE HEIGHTENED RISKS RELATED TO THE SAME FACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THOSE
ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR RELATIVELY SMALL SIZE AND LESSER LIQUIDITY. THE FUND'S USE
OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TECHNIQUES INVOLVES SPECIAL RISKS AS SUCH TECHNIQUES MAY NOT
ACHIEVE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS AND/OR MAY RESULT IN LOSSES TO THE FUND. ALSO,
AS A NONDIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT COMPANY, THE FUND MAY INVEST IN A RELATIVELY
SMALL NUMBER OF ISSUERS AND, AS A RESULT, BE SUBJECT TO A GREATER RISK OF LOSS
WITH RESPECT TO ITS PORTFOLIO SECURITIES.

Important Notice to Shareholders

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

The Fund's Board previously authorized management to implement an open-market
share repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase Fund shares,
from time to time, in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management.
This authorization remains in effect.

OPTIONS ON SWAP AGREEMENTS (SWAPTIONS)

Generally, the Fund may purchase and write (sell) both put and call options on
swap agreements, commonly known as swaptions, although currently the Fund only
intends to purchase options on interest rate swaps. The Fund may buy options on
interest rate swaps to help hedge the Fund's risk of potentially rising interest
rates. A swaption is an over-the-counter (OTC) option that gives the buyer of
the option the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a previously
negotiated swap agreement, or to extend, terminate, or otherwise modify the
terms of an existing swap agreement, in exchange for the payment of a premium to
the writer (seller) of the option. The writer (seller) of a swaption receives
premium payments from the buyer and, in exchange, becomes obligated to enter
into or modify an underlying swap agreement upon the exercise of the option by
the buyer.

The Fund generally assumes a greater risk when it writes (sells) a swaption than
when it purchases a swaption. When the Fund purchases a swaption, it risks
losing the amount of premium it has paid, should it elect not to exercise the
option, plus any related transaction costs. When the Fund writes (sells) a
swaption, however, the Fund is bound by the terms of the underlying swap
agreement upon exercise of the option by the buyer, which may result in losses
to the Fund in excess of the premium it received. Swaptions also involve other
risks associated with both OTC options and swap agreements, such as
counterparty risk (the risk that the counterparty defaults on its obligation),
market risk, credit risk, and interest rate risk. With respect to the Fund's
purchase of options on interest rate swaps, depending on the movement of
interest rates between the time of purchase and expiration of the swaption, the
value of the underlying interest rate swap and therefore the value of the
swaption will change.

Important Notice to Shareholders (CONTINUED)

CREDIT LINKED NOTES (CLNS)

In trying to achieve its investment goals, the Fund may invest in CLNs. A
typical CLN is set-up as a pass-through note structure created by a broker or
bank as an alternative investment for funds or other purchasers to directly
buying a bond or group of bonds. CLNs are typically issued at par, with a
one-to-one relationship with the notional value to the underlying bond(s). The
performance of the CLN, however, including maturity value, is linked to the
performance of the specified underlying bond(s) as well as that of the issuing
entity. CLNs are generally considered to be liquid instruments; however, the
liquidity of the CLN may be impacted by the liquidity of the underlying
reference asset.

In addition to the risk of loss of its principal investment, the Fund bears the
risk that the issuer of the CLN will default or become bankrupt. In such an
event, the Fund may have difficulty being repaid, or fail to be repaid, the
principal amount of its investment. A downgrade or impairment to the credit
rating of the issuer will also likely impact negatively the price of the CLN,
regardless of the price of the bond(s) underlying the CLNs. A CLN is typically
structured as limited recourse, unsecured obligation of the issuer of such
security such that the security will usually be the obligation solely of the
issuer and will not be an obligation or responsibility of any other person,
including the issuer of the underlying bond(s).

Most CLNs are structured as Rule 144A securities so that they may be freely
traded among institutional buyers. However, the market for CLNs may be, or
suddenly can become, illiquid. The other parties to the transaction may be the
only investors with sufficient understanding of the CLN to be interested in
bidding for it. Changes in liquidity may result in significant, rapid and
unpredictable changes in the prices of CLNs. In certain cases, a market price
for a CLN may not be available or may not be reliable, and the Fund could
experience difficulty in selling such security at a price the manager believes
is fair.

DIVIDEND AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES INVESTMENT POLICY

The Fund may invest up to 10% of its assets in municipal securities when the
investment manager believes it is advisable to do so. Municipal securities are
issued by state and local governments, their agencies and authorities, as well
as by the District of Columbia and U.S. territories and possessions, to borrow
money for various public or private projects. The issuer pays a fixed, floating
or variable rate of interest, and must repay the amount borrowed (the principal)
at maturity. Municipal securities generally pay interest free from federal
income tax.

<PAGE>

Important Notice to Shareholders (CONTINUED)

DIVIDEND AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES INVESTMENT POLICY (CONTINUED)

Investing in municipal securities involves risks, such as the issuer's inability
to make interest payments and repay principal. Changes in an issuer's financial
strength or in a security's credit rating may affect a security's value and,
thus, impact Fund performance. In addition, these securities can be impacted by
events in the states and territories that issue them, which may include economic
or political policy changes, tax base erosion, state constitutional limits on
tax increases, budget deficits and other financial difficulties, and changes in
the credit ratings assigned to the state's municipal issuers.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Templeton Global Income Fund (Fund) is registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended, (1940 Act) as a closed-end investment company.

The following summarizes the Fund's significant accounting policies.

A. SECURITY VALUATION

Corporate debt securities, government securities and municipal securities
generally trade in the over-the-counter market rather than on a securities
exchange. The Fund may utilize independent pricing services, quotations from
bond dealers, and information with respect to bond and note transactions, to
assist in determining a current market value for each security. The Fund's
pricing services may use valuation models or matrix pricing which considers
information with respect to comparable bond and note transactions, quotations
from bond dealers, or by reference to other securities that are considered
comparable in such characteristics as rating, interest rate and maturity date,
option adjusted spread models, prepayment projections, interest rate spreads and
yield curves, to determine current value. Debt securities denominated in a
foreign currency are converted into their U.S. dollar equivalent at the foreign
exchange rate in effect at the close of the NYSE on the date that the values of
the foreign debt securities are determined. Investments in open-end mutual funds
are valued at the closing net asset value.

The Fund has procedures to determine the fair value of individual securities and
other assets for which market prices are not readily available or which may not
be reliably priced. Methods for valuing these securities may include:
fundamental analysis based upon the underlying investment book value,
anticipated future cash flows, market changes in comparable or similar
securities, matrix pricing, discounts from market prices of similar securities,
or discounts applied due to the nature and duration of restrictions on the
disposition of the securities. Due to the inherent uncertainty of valuations of
such securities, the fair values may differ significantly from the values that
would have been used had a ready market for such investments existed.
Occasionally, events occur between the time at which trading in a security is
completed and the close of the NYSE that might call into question the
availability (including the reliability) of the value of a portfolio security
held by the Fund. If such an event occurs, the securities may be valued using
fair value procedures, which may include the use of independent pricing
services. All security valuation procedures are approved by the Fund's Board of
Trustees.

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

Portfolio securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate of such
currencies against U.S. dollars on the date of valuation. Purchases and sales of
securities, income and expense items denominated in foreign currencies are
translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transaction
date. Occasionally, events may impact the availability or reliability of foreign
exchange rates used to convert the U.S. dollar equivalent value. If such an
event occurs, the foreign exchange rate will be valued at fair value using
procedures established and approved by the Fund's Board of Trustees.

Templeton Global Income Fund

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION (CONTINUED)

The Fund does not separately report the effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates from changes in market prices on securities held. Such changes are
included in net realized and unrealized gain or loss from investments on the
Statement of Operations.

Realized foreign exchange gains or losses arise from sales of foreign
currencies, currency gains or losses realized between the trade and settlement
dates on securities transactions and the difference between the recorded amounts
of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding taxes and the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized foreign
exchange gains and losses arise from changes in foreign exchange rates on
foreign denominated assets and liabilities other than investments in securities
held at the end of the reporting period.

C. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Fund may invest in derivative financial instruments (derivatives) in order
to manage risk or gain exposure to various other investments or markets.
Derivatives are financial contracts based on an underlying or notional amount,
require no initial investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than
would normally be required to have a similar response to changes in market
factors, and require or permit net settlement. Derivatives may contain various
risks including the potential inability of the counterparty to fulfill their
obligations under the terms of the contract, the potential for an illiquid
secondary market, and the potential for market movements which may expose the
Fund to gains or losses in excess of the amounts shown on the Statement of
Assets and Liabilities.

Derivatives are marked to market daily based upon quotations from market makers
or the Fund's independent pricing services and the Fund's net benefit or
obligation under the contract, as measured by the fair market value of the
contract, is included in net assets. Realized gain and loss and unrealized
appreciation and depreciation on these contracts for the period are included in
the Statement of Operations.

The Fund enters into forward exchange contracts in order to hedge against
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or to gain exposure to certain foreign
currencies. A forward exchange contract is an agreement between the Fund and a
counterparty to buy or sell a foreign currency for a specific exchange rate on a
future date. Pursuant to the terms of the forward exchange contacts, cash or
securities may be required to be deposited as collateral.

The Fund enters into interest rate swap contracts generally in order to manage
interest rate risk. An interest rate swap is an agreement between the Fund and a
counterparty to exchange cash flows based on the difference between two interest
rates, applied to a notional principal amount. Over the term of the contract,
contractually required payments to be paid and to be received are accrued daily
and recorded as unrealized depreciation and appreciation until the payments are
made, at which time they are realized. Pursuant to the terms of the interest
rate swap contract,

cash or securities may be required to be deposited as collateral. Any cash
received may be invested according to the Fund's investment objectives.

See Note 10 regarding other derivative information.

D. INCOME TAXES

No provision has been made for U.S. income taxes because it is the Fund's policy
to qualify as a regulated investment company under the Internal Revenue Code and
to distribute to shareholders substantially all of its taxable income and net
realized gains.

The Fund has reviewed the tax positions, taken on federal income tax returns,
for each of the three open tax years and as of August 31, 2009, and has
determined that no provision for income tax is required in the Fund's financial
statements.

Foreign securities held by the Fund may be subject to foreign taxation on
interest income received. Foreign taxes, if any, are recorded based on the tax
regulations and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which the Fund
invests.

E. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS, INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPENSES AND DISTRIBUTIONS

Security transactions are accounted for on trade date. Realized gains and losses
on security transactions are determined on a specific identification basis.
Interest income and estimated expenses are accrued daily. Amortization of
premium and accretion of discount on debt securities are included in interest
income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date and are determined according
to income tax regulations (tax basis). Distributable earnings determined on a
tax basis may differ from earnings recorded in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These differences
may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified among
capital accounts to reflect their tax character. These reclassifications have no
impact on net assets or the results of operations. Temporary differences are not
reclassified, as they may reverse in subsequent periods.

Inflation-indexed bonds provide an inflation hedge through periodic increases or
decreases in the security's interest accruals and principal redemption value, by
amounts corresponding to the current rate of inflation. Any such adjustments,
including adjustments to principal redemption value, are recorded as interest
income.

F. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of income
and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

G. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified by the Fund against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Fund. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Fund enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Fund that have not yet occurred. Currently, the Fund expects the
risk of loss to be remote.

2. SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST

At August 31, 2009, there were an unlimited number of shares authorized (without
par value). Transactions in the Fund's shares were as follows:

The Fund's Board of Trustees previously authorized an open-market share
repurchase program pursuant to which the Fund may purchase, from time to time,
Fund shares in open-market transactions, at the discretion of management. This
authorization remains in effect. Through August 31, 2009, the Fund had
repurchased a total of 11,210,400 shares. During the years ended August 31, 2009
and August 31, 2008, there were no shares repurchased.

respectively.

5. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended August 31, 2009
and August 31, 2008, was as follows:

<TABLE>

At August 31, 2009, the cost of investments, net unrealized appreciation
(depreciation), and undistributed ordinary income for income tax purposes were
as follows:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

Net investment income differs for financial statement and tax purposes primarily
due to differing treatments of foreign currency transactions, swaps, bond
discounts and premiums, tax straddles, and inflation related adjustments on
foreign securities.

Net realized gains (losses) differ for financial statement and tax purposes
primarily due to differing treatments of wash sales, foreign currency
transactions, swaps, bond discounts and premiums, and tax straddles.

6. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Purchases and sales of investments (excluding short term securities) for the
year ended August 31, 2009, aggregated $772,939,444 and $575,245,343,
respectively.

7. INVESTMENTS IN INSTITUTIONAL FIDUCIARY TRUST MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO

The Fund may invest in the Institutional Fiduciary Trust Money Market Portfolio
(Sweep Money Fund), an open-end investment company managed by Advisers.
Management fees paid by the Fund are reduced on assets invested in the Sweep
Money Fund, in an amount not to exceed the management and administrative fees
paid by the Sweep Money Fund.

8. CREDIT RISK

At August 31, 2009, the Fund had 17.55% of its portfolio invested in high yield
or other securities rated below investment grade. These securities may be more
sensitive to economic conditions causing greater price volatility and are
potentially subject to a greater risk of loss due to default than higher rated
securities.

9. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

Investing in foreign securities may include certain risks and considerations not
typically associated with investing in U.S. securities, such as fluctuating
currency values and changing local and regional economic, political and social
conditions, which may result in greater market volatility. In addition, certain
foreign securities may not be as liquid as U.S. securities.

11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Fund adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB
Statement No. 157, "Fair Value Measurement" (SFAS 157), on September 1, 2008.
SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The Fund has determined
that the implementation of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on the Fund's
financial statements.

SFAS 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market
data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and the Fund's own
market assumptions (unobservable inputs). These inputs are used in determining
the value of the Fund's investments and are summarized in the following fair
value hierarchy:

     -    Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical securities

     -    Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices
          for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speed, credit risk,
          etc.)

     -    Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own
          assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities are not an indication of
the risk associated with investing in those securities.

The following is a summary of the inputs used as of August 31, 2009, in valuing
the Fund's assets and liabilities carried at fair value:

Templeton Global Income Fund

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the statement of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Templeton Global Income Fund (the
"Fund") at August 31, 2009, the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of securities at August
31, 2009 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

Templeton Global Income Fund

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED)

Under Section 871(k)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), the Fund
designates the maximum amount allowable but no less than $370,161 as interest
related dividends for purposes of the tax imposed under Section 871(a)(1)(A) of
the Code for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2009.

At August 31, 2009, more than 50% of the Templeton Global Income Fund's total
assets were invested in securities of foreign issuers. In most instances,
foreign taxes were withheld from income paid to the Fund on these investments.
As shown in the table below, the Fund designates to shareholders the foreign
source income and foreign taxes paid, pursuant to Section 853 of the Code. This
designation will allow shareholders of record on August 18, 2009, to treat their
proportionate share of foreign taxes paid by the Fund as having been paid
directly by them. The shareholder shall consider these amounts as foreign taxes
paid in the tax year in which they receive the Fund distribution.

The following table provides a detailed analysis of foreign tax paid, foreign
source income, and foreign qualified dividends as designated by the Fund, to
shareholders of record.

RECORD DATE: 8/18/2009

</TABLE>

Foreign Tax Paid Per Share (Column 1) is the amount per share available to you,
as a tax credit (assuming you held your shares in the Fund for a minimum of 16
days during the 31-day period beginning 15 days before the ex-dividend date of
the Fund's distribution to which the foreign taxes relate), or, as a tax
deduction.

Foreign Source Income Per Share (Column 2) is the amount per share of income
dividends paid to you that is attributable to foreign securities held by the
Fund, plus any foreign taxes withheld on these dividends. The amounts reported
include foreign source qualified dividends that have not been adjusted for the
rate differential applicable to such dividend income.(1)

Foreign Qualified Dividends Per Share (Column 3) is the amount per share of
foreign source qualified dividends the Fund paid to you, plus any foreign taxes
withheld on these dividends. These amounts represent the portion of the Foreign
Source Income reported to you in column 2 that were derived from qualified
foreign securities held by the Fund.(1)

(1)  Qualified dividends are taxed at a maximum rate of 15% (5% for those in the
     10% and 15% income tax bracket). In determining the amount of foreign tax
     credit that may be applied against the U.S. tax liability of individuals
     receiving foreign source qualified dividends, adjustments may be required
     to the foreign tax credit limitation calculation to reflect the rate
     differential applicable to such dividend income. The rules however permit
     certain individuals to elect not to apply the rate differential adjustments
     for capital gains and/or dividends for any taxable year. Please consult
     your tax advisor and the instructions to Form 1116 for more information.

TAX DESIGNATION (UNAUDITED) (CONTINUED)

In January 2010, shareholders will receive Form 1099-DIV which will include
their share of taxes paid and foreign source income distributed during the
calendar year 2009. The Foreign Source Income reported on Form 1099-DIV has not
been adjusted for the rate differential on foreign source qualified dividend
income. Shareholders are advised to check with their tax advisors for
information on the treatment of these amounts on their 2009 individual income
tax returns.

Templeton Global Income Fund

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND CASH PURCHASE PLAN

The Fund offers a Dividend Reinvestment and Cash Purchase Plan (the "Plan") with
the following features:

Shareholders must affirmatively elect to participate in the Plan. If you decide
to use this service, share dividends and capital gains distributions will be
reinvested automatically in shares of the Fund for your account. BNY Mellon
Shareowner Services, P.O. Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8035, will provide
additional Plan information upon request.

Whenever the Fund declares dividends in either cash or shares of the Fund, if
the market price is equal to or exceeds net asset value at the valuation date,
the participant will receive the dividends entirely in new shares at a price
equal to the net asset value, but not less than 95% of the then current market
price of the Fund's shares. If the market price is lower than net asset value or
if dividends and/or capital gains distributions are payable only in cash, the
participant will receive shares purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or
otherwise on the open market.

A participant has the option of submitting additional cash payments to the Plan
Administrator, in any amounts of at least $100, up to a maximum of $5,000 per
month, for the purchase of Fund shares for his or her account. These payments
can be made by check or money order payable to The Bank of New York Mellon (the
"Plan Administrator") and sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P.O. Box
382009, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8009, Attention: Templeton Global Income Fund. The
Plan Administrator will apply such payments (less a $5.00 service charge and
less a pro rata share of trading fees) to purchases of Fund shares on the open
market.

The automatic reinvestment of dividends and/or capital gains does not relieve
the participant of any income tax that may be payable on dividends or
distributions.

Whenever shares are purchased on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise on the
open market, each participant will pay a pro rata portion of trading fees.
Trading fees will be deducted from amounts to be invested. The Plan
Administrator's fee for a sale of shares through the Plan is $15.00 per
transaction plus a $0.12 per share trading fee.

A participant may withdraw from the Plan without penalty at any time by written
notice to the Plan Administrator sent to BNY Mellon Shareowner Services, P. O.
Box 358035, Pittsburgh, PA, 15252-8035. Upon withdrawal, the participant will
receive, without charge, share certificates issued in the participant's name for
all full shares held by the Plan Administrator; or, if the participant wishes,
the Plan Administrator will sell the shares and send the proceeds to the
participant, less a service charge of $15.00 and less trading fees of $0.12 per
share. The Plan Administrator will convert any fractional shares you hold at the
time of your withdrawal to cash at current market value and send you a check for
the net proceeds.

TEMPLETON GLOBAL INCOME FUND

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

At a meeting held May 19, 2009, the Board of Trustees (Board), including a
majority of non-interested or independent Trustees, approved renewal of the
investment management agreement for the Fund. In reaching this decision, the
Board took into account information furnished throughout the year at regular
Board meetings, as well as information prepared specifically in connection with
the annual renewal review process. Information furnished and discussed
throughout the year included investment performance reports and related
financial information for the Fund, as well as periodic reports on shareholder
services, legal, compliance, pricing, brokerage commissions and execution and
other services provided by the Investment Manager (Manager) and its affiliates.
Information furnished specifically in connection with the renewal process
included a report for the Fund prepared by Lipper, Inc. (Lipper), an independent
organization, as well as additional material, including a Fund profitability
analysis report prepared by management. The Lipper report compared the Fund's
investment performance and expenses with those of other funds deemed comparable
to the Fund as selected by Lipper. The Fund profitability analysis report
discussed the profitability to Franklin Templeton Investments from its overall
U.S. fund operations, as well as on an individual fund-by-fund basis. Included
with such profitability analysis report was information on a fund-by-fund basis
listing portfolio managers and other accounts they manage, as well as
information on management fees charged by the Manager and its affiliates
including management's explanation of differences where relevant and a
three-year expense analysis with an explanation for any increase in expense
ratios. Additional material accompanying such report was a memorandum prepared
by management describing project initiatives and capital investments relating to
the services provided to the Fund by the Franklin Templeton Investments
organization, as well as a memorandum relating to economies of scale. Such
material also discussed some of the actions taken by management in coping with
problems arising out of the past year's financial upheaval.

In considering such materials, the independent Trustees received assistance and
advice from and met separately with independent counsel. In approving
continuance of the investment management agreement for the Fund, the Board,
including a majority of independent Trustees, determined that the existing
management fee structure was fair and reasonable and that continuance of the
investment management agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its
shareholders. While attention was given to all information furnished, the
following discusses some primary factors relevant to the Board's decision.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES. The Board was satisfied with the nature
and quality of the overall services provided by the Manager and its affiliates
to the Fund and its shareholders. In addition to investment performance and
expenses discussed later, the Board's opinion was based, in part, upon periodic
reports furnished it showing that the investment policies and restrictions for
the Fund were consistently complied with as well as other reports periodically
furnished the Board covering matters such as the compliance of portfolio
managers and other management personnel with the code of ethics adopted
throughout the Franklin Templeton fund complex, the adherence to fair value
pricing procedures established by the Board, and the accuracy of net asset value
calculations. Favorable consideration was given to management's continuous
efforts and expenditures in establishing back-up systems and recovery procedures
to function in the

event of a natural disaster, it being noted that such systems and procedures had
functioned smoothly during the Florida hurricanes and blackouts experienced in
recent years. Consideration was also given to the experience of the Fund's
portfolio management team, the number of accounts managed and general method of
compensation. In this latter respect, the Board noted that a primary factor in
management's determination of a portfolio manager's bonus compensation was the
relative investment performance of the funds he or she managed and that a
portion of such bonus was required to be invested in a predesignated list of
funds within such person's fund management area so as to be aligned with the
interests of Fund shareholders. Particular attention was given to the overall
performance and actions taken by the Manager and its affiliates in response to
problems arising out of the market turmoil and financial crisis experienced
during the past year. In this respect, the Board noted that management's
independent credit analysis and diligent risk management procedures had
prevented any structured investment products or other volatile instruments from
being held in the portfolios of any of the money market funds within the
Franklin Templeton complex, including the sweep money fund utilized by the Fund
as part of its cash management. The Board also took into account, among other
things, the strong financial position of the Manager's parent company and its
commitment to the fund business. The Board also noted that during the past year
Franklin Templeton Investments, like many other fund managers, had announced a
hiring freeze and implemented employee reductions, and the Board discussed with
management the nature of such reductions and steps being taken to minimize any
negative impact on the nature and quality of services being provided the Fund.

INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The Board placed significant emphasis on the investment
performance of the Fund in view of its importance to shareholders. While
consideration was given to performance reports and discussions with portfolio
managers at Board meetings during the year, particular attention in assessing
performance was given to the Lipper reports furnished for the agreement renewal.
The Lipper report for the Fund showed its investment performance for the
one-year period ended February 28, 2009, as well as the previous 10 years ended
that date in respect to a performance universe consisting of the Fund and all
closed-end non-leveraged global income funds as selected by Lipper. Such report
considered both the Fund's income return and total return on a net asset value
basis without regard to market discounts or premiums to accurately reflect
investment performance. The Lipper report showed that the Fund's income return
for the one-year period was in the highest or best performing quintile of the
Lipper performance universe, and on an annualized basis was also in the highest
quintile of such universe for the previous three- and five-year periods, and in
the middle quintile of such universe for the previous 10-year period. Consistent
with the market sell-off that occurred in 2008, the Fund, along with most funds
within its performance universe, experienced losses for the one-year period. On
a comparative basis, however, the Lipper report showed the Fund's total return
to be in the highest quintile of such performance universe for the one-year
period, and, on an annualized basis, to also be in the highest quintile of such
universe for each of the previous three-, five- and 10-year periods. The Board
noted such favorable comparative performance.

BOARD REVIEW OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (CONTINUED)

COMPARATIVE EXPENSES. Consideration was given to a comparative analysis of the
management fees and total expense ratios of the Fund compared with an expense
group consisting of the Fund and three other closed-end funds as selected by
Lipper. Lipper expense data is based upon historical information taken from each
fund's most recent annual report and, as a result of the severe decline in fund
industry assets during the last quarter of 2008, is based on asset levels that
are higher than the level currently existing for most funds. While recognizing
the limitations inherent in Lipper's methodology and recognizing that current
expense ratios may increase as assets decline, the Board believed that the
independent analysis conducted by Lipper remained an appropriate measure of
comparative expenses. In reviewing comparative costs, Lipper provides
information on the Fund's contractual investment management fee rate in
comparison with the contractual investment management fee rate that would have
been charged by the other funds within the Lipper expense group assuming they
were similar in size to the Fund, as well as the actual total expense rate of
the Fund in comparison with those of the other funds. The Lipper contractual
investment management fee analysis considers administrative fees to be part of
management fees and the results of such expense comparison showed both the
Fund's contractual investment management fee rate and total actual expense rate
to be the lowest in its Lipper expense group. The Board was satisfied with the
Fund's comparative management fee and expenses.

MANAGEMENT PROFITABILITY. The Board also considered the level of profits
realized by the Manager and its affiliates in connection with the operation of
the Fund. In this respect, the Board reviewed the Fund profitability analysis
that addresses the overall profitability of Franklin Templeton's U.S. fund
business, as well as its profits in providing management and other services to
the Fund during the 12-month period ended September 30, 2008, being the most
recent fiscal year end for Franklin Resources, Inc., the Manager's parent.
During such period, the assets of the Franklin Templeton U.S. fund business were
significantly higher than currently existing, and to such extent the
profitability analysis does not reflect current fund operations. While taking
this into account in assessing the significance of the Fund profitability
analysis, the Board recognized such analysis was made at a given point in time
and that the decline in assets and effect on profitability would be reflected in
the profitability analysis covering Franklin Resources' 2009 fiscal year period.
In reviewing the analysis, attention was given to the methodology followed in
allocating costs to the Fund, it being recognized that allocation methodologies
are inherently subjective and various allocation methodologies may each be
reasonable while producing different results. In this respect, the Board noted
that, while being continuously refined and reflecting changes in the Manager's
own cost accounting, the allocation methodology was consistent with that
followed in profitability report presentations for the Fund made in prior years
and that the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm had been
engaged by the Manager to perform certain procedures on a biennial basis,
specified and approved by the Manager and the Fund's Board solely for their
purposes and use in reference to the profitability analysis. In reviewing and
discussing such analysis, management discussed with the Board its belief that
costs incurred in establishing the infrastructure necessary for the type of fund
operations conducted by the Manager and its affiliates may not be fully
reflected in the expenses allocated to the Fund in determining its
profitability, as well as the

fact that the level of profits, to a certain extent, reflected operational cost
savings and efficiencies initiated by management. The Board also took into
account management's expenditures in improving shareholder services provided the
Fund, as well as the need to meet additional regulatory and compliance
requirements resulting from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and recent SEC and other
regulatory requirements. In addition, the Board considered a third-party study
comparing the profitability of the Manager's parent on an overall basis as
compared to other publicly held managers broken down to show profitability from
management operations exclusive of distribution expenses, as well as
profitability including distribution expenses. The Board also considered the
extent to which the Manager and its affiliates might derive ancillary benefits
from fund operations. Based upon its consideration of all these factors, the
Board determined that the level of profits realized by the Manager and its
affiliates from providing services to the Fund was not excessive in view of the
nature, quality and extent of services provided.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board also considered whether the Manager realizes
economies of scale as the Fund grows larger and the extent to which any such
benefit is shared with the Fund and its shareholders. The Board believed that a
manager's ability to realize economies of scale and the sharing of such benefit
is a more relevant consideration in the case of an open-end fund whose size
increases as a result of the continuous sale of its shares. A closed-end
investment company such as the Fund does not continuously offer shares, and
growth following its initial public offering will primarily result from market
appreciation, which benefits its shareholders. While believing economies of
scale to be less of a factor in the context of a closed-end fund, the Board
believes at some point an increase in size may lead to economies of scale that
should be shared with the Fund and its shareholders. In this respect, the Board
noted the Fund is charged a management advisory fee and administrative fee at
the combined rate of 0.70% on its first $200 million of net assets; 0.635% on
the next $500 million of net assets; 0.60% on the next $300 million of net
assets; and 0.58% on the next $4 billion of net assets with decreasing
breakpoints continuing through the $20 billion net asset level. The Fund's asset
size was approximately $1 billion on December 31, 2008, and the Board believed
such fee schedule provides a sharing of benefits with the Fund and its
shareholders.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.  N/A

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE  OF PROXY VOTING  POLICIES  AND  PROCEDURES  FOR  CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The board of trustees of the Fund has delegated the authority to vote proxies
related to the portfolio securities held by the Fund to the Fund's manager
Franklin Advisers, Inc. in accordance with the Proxy Voting Policies and
Procedures (Policies) adopted by the manager.

The manager has delegated its administrative duties with respect to the voting
of proxies to the Proxy Group within Franklin Templeton Companies, LLC (Proxy
Group), an affiliate and wholly owned subsidiary of Franklin Resources, Inc. All
proxies received by the Proxy Group will be voted based upon the manager's
instructions and/or policies.

To assist it in analyzing proxies, the manager subscribes to RiskMetrics Group
(RiskMetrics), an unaffiliated third-party corporate governance research service
that provides in-depth analyses of shareholder meeting agendas, vote
recommendations, recordkeeping and vote disclosure services. In addition, the
manager subscribes to Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC (Glass Lewis), an unaffiliated
third-party analytical research firm, to receive analyses and vote
recommendations on the shareholder meetings of publicly held U.S. companies.
Although RiskMetrics' and/or Glass Lewis' analyses are thoroughly reviewed and
considered in making a final voting decision, the manager does not consider
recommendations from RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or any other third party to be
determinative of the manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of policy, the
officers, directors/trustees and employees of the manager and the Proxy Group
will not be influenced by outside sources whose interests conflict with the
interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Efforts are made to resolve all
conflicts in the interests of the manager's clients. Material conflicts of
interest are identified by the Proxy Group based upon analyses of client,
distributor, broker dealer and vendor lists, information periodically gathered
from directors and officers, and information derived from other sources,
including public filings. In situations where a material conflict of interest is
identified, the Proxy Group may defer to the voting recommendation of
RiskMetrics, Glass Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of
proxy services; or send the proxy directly to the Fund with the manager's
recommendation regarding the vote for approval. If the conflict is not resolved
by the Fund, the Proxy Group may refer the matter, along with the recommended
course of action by the manager, if any, to an interdepartmental Proxy Review
Committee (which may include portfolio managers and/or research analysts
employed by the manager), for evaluation and voting instructions. The Proxy
Review Committee may defer to the voting recommendation of RiskMetrics, Glass
Lewis or those of another independent third-party provider of proxy services; or
send the proxy directly to the Fund. Where the Proxy Group or the Proxy Review
Committee refers a matter to the Fund, it may rely upon the instructions of a
representative of the Fund, such as the board or a committee of the board.

Where a material conflict of interest has been identified, but the items on
which the manager's vote recommendations differ from Glass Lewis, RiskMetrics,
or another independent third-party provider of proxy services relate
specifically to (1) shareholder proposals regarding social or environmental
issues or political contributions, (2) "Other Business" without describing the
matters that might be considered, or (3) items the manager wishes to vote in
opposition to the recommendations of an issuer's management, the Proxy Group may
defer to the vote recommendations of the manager rather than sending the proxy
directly to the Fund for approval.

To avoid certain potential conflicts of interest, the manager will employ echo
voting, if possible, in the following instances: (1) when the Fund invests in an
underlying fund in reliance on any one of Sections 12(d)(1)(E), (F), or (G) of
the 1940 Act, or pursuant to an SEC exemptive order; (2) when the Fund invests
uninvested cash in affiliated money market funds pursuant to an SEC exemptive
order ("cash sweep arrangement"); or (3) when required pursuant to the Fund's
governing documents or applicable law. Echo voting means that the investment
manager will vote the shares in the same proportion as the vote of all of the
other holders of the Fund's shares.

The recommendation of management on any issue is a factor that the manager
considers in determining how proxies should be voted. However, the manager does
not consider recommendations from management to be determinative of the
manager's ultimate decision. As a matter of practice, the votes with respect to
most issues are cast in accordance with the position of the company's
management. Each issue, however, is considered on its own merits, and the
manager will not support the position of the company's management in any
situation where it deems that the ratification of management's position would
adversely affect the investment merits of owning that company's shares.

MANAGER'S PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PRINCIPLES The manager has adopted general
proxy voting guidelines, which are summarized below. These guidelines are not an
exhaustive list of all the issues that may arise and the manager cannot
anticipate all future situations. In all cases, each proxy will be considered
based on the relevant facts and circumstances.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. The manager supports an independent board of directors, and
prefers that key committees such as audit, nominating, and compensation
committees be comprised of independent directors. The manager will generally
vote against management efforts to classify a board and will generally support
proposals to declassify the board of directors. The manager may withhold votes
from directors who have attended less than 75% of meetings without a valid
reason. While generally in favor of separating Chairman and CEO positions, the
manager will review this issue as well as proposals to restore or provide for
cumulative voting on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration factors
such as the company's corporate governance guidelines or provisions and
performance.

RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS OF PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. The manager will closely
scrutinize the role and performance of auditors. On a case-by-case basis, the
manager will examine proposals relating to non-audit relationships and non-audit
fees. The manager will also consider, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to
rotate auditors, and will vote against the ratification of auditors when there
is clear and compelling evidence of accounting irregularities or negligence.

MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION. A company's equity-based compensation plan
should be in alignment with the shareholders' long-term interests. The manager
believes that executive compensation should be directly linked to the
performance of the company. The manager evaluates plans on a case-by-case basis
by considering several factors to determine whether the plan is fair and
reasonable, including the RiskMetrics quantitative model utilized to assess such
plans and/or the Glass Lewis evaluation of the plans. The manager will generally
oppose plans that have the potential to be excessively dilutive, and will almost
always oppose plans that are structured to allow the repricing of underwater
options, or plans that have an automatic share replenishment "evergreen"
feature. The manager will generally support employee stock option plans in which
the purchase price is at least 85% of fair market value, and when potential
dilution is 10% or less.

Severance compensation arrangements will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis,
although the manager will generally oppose "golden parachutes" that are
considered to be excessive. The manager will normally support proposals that
require a percentage of directors' compensation to be in the form of common
stock, as it aligns their interests with those of shareholders.

ANTI-TAKEOVER MECHANISMS AND RELATED ISSUES. The manager generally opposes
anti-takeover measures since they tend to reduce shareholder rights. However, as
with all proxy issues, the manager conducts an independent review of each
anti-takeover proposal. On occasion, the manager may vote with management when
the research analyst has concluded that the proposal is not onerous and would
not harm the Fund or its shareholders' interests. The manager generally supports
proposals that require shareholder rights' plans ("poison pills") to be subject
to a shareholder vote and will closely evaluate such plans on a case-by-case
basis to determine whether or not they warrant support. In addition, the manager
will generally vote against any proposal to issue stock that has unequal or
subordinate voting rights. The manager generally opposes any supermajority
voting requirements as well as the payment of "greenmail." The manager generally
supports "fair price" provisions and confidential voting.

CHANGES TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE. The manager realizes that a company's financing
decisions have a significant impact on its shareholders, particularly when they
involve the issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock or the
assumption of additional debt. The manager will review, on a case-by-case basis,
proposals by companies to increase authorized shares and the purpose for the
increase. The manager will generally not vote in favor of dual-class capital
structures to increase the number of authorized shares where that class of stock
would have superior voting rights. The manager will generally vote in favor of
the issuance of preferred stock in cases where the company specifies the voting,
dividend, conversion and other rights of such stock and the terms of the
preferred stock issuance are deemed reasonable.

MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING. Mergers and acquisitions will be subject to
careful review by the research analyst to determine whether they would be
beneficial to shareholders. The manager will analyze various economic and
strategic factors in making the final decision on a merger or acquisition.
Corporate restructuring proposals are also subject to a thorough examination on
a case-by-case basis.

SOCIAL AND CORPORATE POLICY ISSUES. The manager will generally give management
discretion with regard to social, environmental and ethical issues, although the
manager may vote in favor of those that are believed to have significant
economic benefits or implications for the Fund and its shareholders.

GLOBAL CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. Many of the tenets discussed above are applied to
the manager's proxy voting decisions for international investments. However, the
manager must be flexible in these instances and must be mindful of the varied
market practices of each region.

The manager will attempt to process every proxy it receives for all domestic and
foreign issuers. However, there may be situations in which the manager cannot
process proxies, for example, where a meeting notice was received too late, or
sell orders preclude the ability to vote. If a security is on loan, the manager
may determine that it is not in the best interests of the Fund to recall the
security for voting purposes. Also, the manager may abstain from voting under
certain circumstances or vote against items such as "Other Business" when the
manager is not given adequate information from the company.

voting records are available online at franklintempleton.com and posted on the
SEC website at www.sec.gov. The proxy voting records are updated each year by
August 31 to reflect the most recent 12-month period ended June 30.

ITEM 8.  PORTFOLIO  MANAGERS OF  CLOSED-END  MANAGEMENT  INVESTMENT  COMPANY AND

would not be solely responsible for managing such listed amounts.

Portfolio managers that provide investment services to the Fund may also provide
services to a variety of other investment products, including other funds,
institutional accounts and private accounts. The advisory fees for some of such
other products and accounts may be different than that charged to the Fund and
may include performance based compensation. This may result in fees that are
higher (or lower) than the advisory fees paid by the Fund. As a matter of
policy, each fund or account is managed solely for the benefit of the beneficial
owners thereof. As discussed below, the separation of the trading execution
function from the portfolio management function and the application of
objectively based trade allocation procedures helps to mitigate potential
conflicts of interest that may arise as a result of the portfolio managers
managing accounts with different advisory fees.

CONFLICTS. The management of multiple funds, including the Fund, and accounts
may also give rise to potential conflicts of interest if the funds and other
accounts have different objectives, benchmarks, time horizons, and fees as the
portfolio manager must allocate his or her time and investment ideas across
multiple funds and accounts. The manager seeks to manage such competing
interests for the time and attention of portfolio managers by having portfolio
managers focus on a particular investment discipline. Most other accounts
managed by a portfolio manager are managed using the same investment strategies
that are used in connection with the management of the Fund. Accordingly,
portfolio holdings, position sizes, and industry and sector exposures tend to be
similar across similar portfolios, which may minimize the potential for
conflicts of interest. As noted above, the separate management of the trade
execution and valuation functions from the portfolio management process also
helps to reduce potential conflicts of interest. However, securities selected
for funds or accounts other than the Fund may outperform the securities selected
for the Fund. Moreover, if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment
opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account, the
Fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an
allocation of that opportunity across all eligible funds and other accounts. The
manager seeks to manage such potential conflicts by using procedures intended to
provide a fair allocation of buy and sell opportunities among funds and other
accounts.

The structure of a portfolio manager's compensation may give rise to potential
conflicts of interest. A portfolio manager's base pay and bonus tend to increase
with additional and more complex responsibilities that include increased assets
under management. As such, there may be an indirect relationship between a
portfolio manager's marketing or sales efforts and his or her bonus.

Finally, the management of personal accounts by a portfolio manager may give
rise to potential conflicts of interest. While the funds and the manager have
adopted a code of ethics which they believe contains provisions reasonably
necessary to prevent a wide range of prohibited activities by portfolio managers
and others with respect to their personal trading activities, there can be no
assurance that the code of ethics addresses all individual conduct that could
result in conflicts of interest.

The manager and the Fund have adopted certain compliance procedures that are
designed to address these, and other, types of conflicts. However, there is no
guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation where a
conflict arises.

COMPENSATION. The manager seeks to maintain a compensation program that is
competitively positioned to attract, retain and motivate top-quality investment
professionals. Portfolio managers receive a base salary, a cash incentive bonus
opportunity, an equity compensation opportunity, and a benefits package.
Portfolio manager compensation is reviewed annually and the level of
compensation is based on individual performance, the salary range for a
portfolio manager's level of responsibility and Franklin Templeton guidelines.
Portfolio managers are provided no financial incentive to favor one fund or
account over another. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of the
following three elements:

         BASE SALARY Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary.

         ANNUAL BONUS Annual bonuses are structured to align the interests of
         the portfolio manager with those of the Fund's shareholders. Each
         portfolio manager is eligible to receive an annual bonus. Bonuses
         generally are split between cash (50% to 65%) and restricted shares of
         Franklin Resources stock (17.5% to 25%) and mutual fund shares (17.5%
         to 25%). The deferred equity-based compensation is intended to build a
         vested interest of the portfolio manager in the financial performance
         of both Franklin Resources and mutual funds advised by the manager. The
         bonus plan is intended to provide a competitive level of annual bonus
         compensation that is tied to the portfolio manager achieving
         consistently strong investment performance, which aligns the financial
         incentives of the portfolio manager and Fund shareholders. The Chief
         Investment Officer of the manager and/or other officers of the manager,
         with responsibility for the Fund, have discretion in the granting of
         annual bonuses to portfolio managers in accordance with Franklin
         Templeton guidelines. The following factors are generally used in
         determining bonuses under the plan:

         |X|  INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. Primary consideration is given to the
              historic investment performance over the 1, 3 and 5 preceding
              years of all accounts managed by the portfolio manager. The
              pre-tax performance of each fund managed is measured relative to a
              relevant peer group and/or applicable benchmark as appropriate.

         |X|  NON-INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE. The more qualitative contributions of
              a portfolio manager to the manager's business and the investment
              management team, including professional knowledge, productivity,
              responsiveness to client needs and communication, are evaluated in
              determining the amount of any bonus award.

         |X|  RESPONSIBILITIES. The characteristics and complexity of funds
              managed by the portfolio manager are factored in the manager's
              appraisal.

         ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Portfolio managers may
         also be awarded restricted shares or units of Franklin Resources stock
         or restricted shares or units of one or more mutual funds, and options
         to purchase common shares of Franklin Resources stock. Awards of such
         deferred equity-based compensation typically vest over time, so as to
         create incentives to retain key talent.

Portfolio managers also participate in benefit plans and programs available
generally to all employees of the manager.

OWNERSHIP OF FUND SHARES. The manager has a policy of encouraging portfolio
managers to invest in the funds they manage. Exceptions arise when, for example,
a fund is closed to new investors or when tax considerations or jurisdictional
constraints cause such an investment to be inappropriate for the portfolio
manager. The following is the dollar range of Fund shares beneficially owned by
each portfolio manager (such amounts may change from time to time):


                                        Dollar Range of Fund
                                         Shares Beneficially

CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVES & SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROCEDURES   Revised December 22, 2008

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            FRANKLIN TEMPLETON FUNDS
                   CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND
                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICERS

I.  Covered Officers and Purpose of the Code

     This  code of  ethics  (the  "Code")  applies  to the  Principal  Executive
Officers,  Principal  Financial  Officer and Principal  Accounting  Officer (the
"Covered  Officers,"  each of whom is set forth in Exhibit A) of each investment
company advised by a Franklin  Resources  subsidiary and that is registered with
the United States Securities & Exchange  Commission ("SEC")  (collectively,  "FT
Funds") for the purpose of promoting:

     o Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical resolution of actual or
       apparent conflicts of  interest between personal and  professional
       relationships;

     o Full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
       documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the SEC and in
       other public communications made by or on behalf of the FT Funds;

     o Compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

     o The prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
       person or persons identified in the Code; and

     o Accountability for adherence to the Code.

     Each  Covered  Officer  will be  expected  to adhere to a high  standard of
business ethics and must be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual
as well as apparent conflicts of interest.

II.  Other Policies and Procedures

     This  Code  shall be the sole  code of  ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for
purposes  of  Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act and the  rules  and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder.

     Franklin  Resources,  Inc.  has  separately  adopted the CODE OF ETHICS AND
BUSINESS  CONDUCT  ("Business  Conduct"),  which is  applicable to all officers,
directors and employees of Franklin Resources, Inc., including Covered Officers.
It  summarizes  the values,  principles  and business  practices  that guide the
employee's business conduct and also provides a set of basic principles to guide
officers,  directors and employees  regarding the minimum  ethical  requirements
expected of them. It supplements  the values,  principles  and business  conduct
identified in the Code and other existing employee policies.

     Additionally, the Franklin Templeton Funds have separately adopted the CODE
OF ETHICS AND POLICY STATEMENT ON INSIDER TRADING governing personal  securities
trading and other related  matters.  The Code for Insider  Trading  provides for
separate  requirements  that  apply to the  Covered  Officers  and  others,  and
therefore is not part of this Code.

     Insofar as other  policies or procedures of Franklin  Resources,  Inc., the
Funds, the Funds' adviser,  principal  underwriter,  or other service  providers
govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities  of the Covered  Officers
who are  subject to this Code,  they are  superceded  by this Code to the extent
that they overlap or conflict with the  provisions  of this Code.  Please review
these other  documents or consult with the Legal  Department  if have  questions
regarding the applicability of these policies to you.

III. Covered Officers Should Handle Ethically Actual and Apparent Conflicts of
Interest

     OVERVIEW.  A "conflict of interest" occurs when a Covered Officer's private
interest  interferes  with the  interests  of, or his or her  service to, the FT
Funds. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a Covered Officer,  or
a member of his  family,  receives  improper  personal  benefits  as a result of
apposition with the FT Funds.

     Certain  conflicts  of  interest  arise  out of the  relationships  between
Covered  Officers  and the FT Funds and  already  are  subject  to  conflict  of
interest  provisions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("Investment  Company
Act") and the Investment  Advisers Act of 1940 ("Investment  Advisers Act"). For
example,  Covered Officers may not individually  engage in certain  transactions
(such as the purchase or sale of securities or other property) with the FT Funds
because of their status as "affiliated  persons" of the FT Funds.  The FT Funds'
and the investment  advisers' compliance programs and procedures are designed to
prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these provisions. This Code does
not, and is not intended to,  repeat or replace these  programs and  procedures,
and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of this Code.

     Although  typically not  presenting an  opportunity  for improper  personal
benefit,  conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual  relationship
between the FT Funds,  the  investment  advisers and the fund  administrator  of
which the Covered  Officers are also  officers or employees.  As a result,  this
Code  recognizes  that the Covered  Officers will, in the normal course of their
duties (whether formally for the FT Funds, for the adviser,  the  administrator,
or for all  three),  be  involved  in  establishing  policies  and  implementing
decisions that will have different effects on the adviser, administrator and the
FT Funds.  The  participation  of the  Covered  Officers in such  activities  is
inherent in the contractual  relationship between the FT Funds, the adviser, and
the administrator and is consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers
of their duties as officers of the FT Funds.  Thus,  if performed in  conformity
with the  provisions of the Investment  Company Act and the Investment  Advisers
Act, such activities will be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition,
it is  recognized  by the FT Funds'  Boards  of  Directors  ("Boards")  that the
Covered  Officers  may  also be  officers  or  employees  of one or  more  other
investment companies covered by this or other codes.

     Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts
of interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment  Company Act and the
Investment  Advisers Act. The following  list provides  examples of conflicts of
interest  under the Code,  but Covered  Officers  should keep in mind that these
examples  are not  exhaustive.  The  overarching  principle is that the personal
interest  of a Covered  Officer  should  not be  placed  improperly  before  the
interest of the FT Funds.

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Not use his or her personal influence  or  personal  relationships
       improperly to influence investment decisions orfinancial reporting by
       the FT Funds whereby the Covered Officer would benefit personally to the
       detriment of the FT Funds;

     o Not cause the FT Funds to take action, or fail to take  action, for the
       individual personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the
       benefit the FT Funds;

     o Not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the FT
       Funds or their affiliated persons for reports of potential  violations
       that are made in good faith;

     o Report  at  least   annually  the  following  affiliations  or other
       relationships:/ 1
          o all directorships for public companies and all companies that are
            required to file reports with the SEC;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship  with any independent
            directors of the FT Funds;
          o any direct or indirect  business relationship with any independent
            public  accounting  firm (which are not related to the routine
            issues related to the firm's service as the Covered Persons
            accountant); and
          o any direct or indirect interest in any transaction with any FT Fund
            that will benefit the officer (not including benefits derived from
            the advisory, sub-advisory, distribution or service agreements with
            affiliates of Franklin Resources).

     These reports will be reviewed by the Legal  Department for compliance with
the Code.

     There are some  conflict  of  interest  situations  that  should  always be
approved  in writing by Franklin  Resources  General  Counsel or Deputy  General
Counsel, if material. Examples of these include/2:

     o Service as a director on the board of any public or private Company;

     o The  receipt  of any gifts in excess  of $100 from any  person,  from any
       corporation or association

     o The receipt of any entertainment from any Company with which the FT Funds
       has current or prospective  business dealings unless such entertainment
       is business related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and
       place, and not so frequent as to raise any question of  impropriety.
       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Covered Officers must obtain prior
       approval from the Franklin Resources General Counsel for any
       entertainment  with a value in excess of $1000.

     o Any ownership  interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship
       with, any of the FT Fund's service providers, other than an investment
       adviser, principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person
       thereof;

     o A direct or  indirect  financial  interest  in  commissions,  transaction
       charges or spreads paid by the FT Funds for   effecting   portfolio
       transactions or for selling or redeeming shares  other than an interest
       arising from the Covered Officer's employment, such as compensation  or
       equity ownership.

     Franklin Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will provide a
report to the FT Funds  Audit  Committee  of any  approvals  granted at the next
regularly scheduled meeting.

IV. Disclosure and Compliance

     o Each Covered  Officer  should  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
       requirements generally applicable to the FT Funds;

     o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others
       to  misrepresent, facts about the FT Funds to others, whether within or
       outside the FT Funds, including to the FT Funds' directors and auditors,
       and to governmental regulators and self-regulatory organizations;

     o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his or her
       area of responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the
       FT Funds, the FT Fund's adviser and the administrator with the goal of
       promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
       the reports and documents the FT Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC
       and in other public communications made by the FT Funds; and

     o It is the  responsibility  of each Covered Officer to promote compliance
       with the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
       regulations.

V. Reporting and Accountability

Each Covered Officer must:

     o Upon becoming a covered officer affirm in writing to the Board that he or
       she has received, read, and understands the Code (see Exhibit B);

     o Annually  thereafter  affirm to the Board that he has  complied  with the
       requirements of the Code; and

     o Notify  Franklin  Resources'  General  Counsel or Deputy General Counsel
       promptly if he or she knows of any violation of this Code. Failure to do
       so is itself is a violation of this Code.

     Franklin Resources' General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel  are
responsible for applying this Code to specific situations in which questions are
presented under  it and have  the  authority  to  interpret  this  Code in any
particular  situation./3 However, the Independent Directors of the respective FT
Funds will consider any  approvals or waivers/4  sought by any Chief  Executive
Officers of the Funds.

     The FT Funds will follow these  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing
this Code:

     o Franklin  Resources General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel will take
       all appropriate action to investigate any potential  violations reported
       to the Legal Department;

     o If,  after such  investigation,  the  General Counsel or Deputy General
       Counsel believes that no violation has occurred, The General Counsel is
       not required to take any further action;

     o Any matter that the General Counsel or Deputy General Counsel believes is
       a  violation  will  be  reported  to  the  Independent   Directors  of
       the appropriate FT Fund;

     o If the Independent Directors concur that a violation has occurred, it
       will inform and make a recommendation to the Board of the appropriate
       FT Fund or Funds, which will consider appropriate action, which may
       include review of, and appropriate modifications to, applicable policies
       and procedures; notification to appropriate personnel of the investment
       adviser or its board; or a recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

     o The Independent Directors will be responsible for granting  waivers, as
       appropriate; and

     o Any changes to or waivers of this Code will, to the extent required, are
       disclosed as provided by SEC rules./5

VI. Other Policies and Procedures

     This Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the FT Funds for
purposes of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms
applicable to registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other
policies or procedures of the FT Funds, the FT Funds' advisers, principal
underwriter, or other service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior
or activities of the Covered Officers who are subject to this Code, they are
superseded by this Code to the extent that they overlap or conflict with the
provisions of this Code. The FT Code of Ethics and Policy Statement On Insider
Trading, adopted by the FT Funds, FT investment advisers and FT Fund's principal
underwriter pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act, the Code of
Ethics and Business Conduct and more detailed policies and procedures set forth
in FT's Employee Handbook are separate requirements applying to the Covered
Officers and others, and are not part of this Code.

VII. Amendments

     Any  amendments to this Code,  other than  amendments to Exhibit A, must be
approved  or  ratified  by a majority  vote of the FT Funds'  Board  including a
majority of independent directors.

VIII. Confidentiality

     All reports and records  prepared or maintained  pursuant to this Code will
be considered  confidential  and shall be maintained and protected  accordingly.
Except as  otherwise  required by law or this Code,  such  matters  shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the FT Funds' Board and their counsel.

IX. Internal Use

     The Code is intended  solely for the  internal use by the FT Funds and does
not  constitute an admission,  by or on behalf of any FT Funds,  as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.

X. Disclosure on Form N-CSR

     Item 2 of Form N-CSR requires a registered management investment company to
disclose annually whether, as of the end of the period covered by the report, it
has  adopted  a code  of  ethics  that  applies  to the  registrant's  principal
executive officer,  principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or
controller, or persons performing similar functions, regardless of whether these
officers are employed by the registrant or a third party.  If the registrant has
not adopted such a code of ethics, it must explain why it has not done so.

     The  registrant  must also:  (1) file with the SEC a copy of the code as an
exhibit  to its  annual  report;  (2) post the text of the code on its  Internet
website and  disclose,  in its most recent  report on Form N-CSR,  its  Internet
address and the fact that it has posted the code on its Internet website; or (3)
undertake  in its most  recent  report on Form  N-CSR to  provide  to any person
without charge, upon request, a copy of the code and explain the manner in which
such  request may be made.  Disclosure  is also  required of  amendments  to, or
waivers  (including  implicit  waivers)  from,  a  provision  of the code in the
registrant's  annual report on Form N-CSR or on its website.  If the  registrant
intends to satisfy the requirement to disclose amendments and waivers by posting
such  information  on its website,  it will be required to disclose its Internet
address and this intention.

     The Legal Department shall be responsible for ensuring that:

     o a copy of the Code is filed  with the SEC as an exhibit to each Fund's
       annual report; and

     o any  amendments to, or waivers (including implicit waivers) from, a
       provision  of the Code is disclosed in the  registrant's annual report
       on Form N-CSR.

     In the event that the  foregoing  disclosure is omitted or is determined to
be incorrect, the Legal Department shall promptly file such information with the
SEC as an amendment to Form N-CSR.

     In such an event, the Fund Chief  Compliance  Officer shall review the Code
and propose such changes to the Code as are necessary or  appropriate to prevent
reoccurrences.

1. Reporting of these affiliations or other relationships shall be made by
completing the annual Directors and Officers Questionnaire and returning the
questionnaire to Franklin Resources Inc, General Counsel or Deputy General
Counsel.

2. Any activity or relationship that would present a conflict for a Covered
Officer may also present a conflict for the Covered Officer if a member of the
Covered Officer's immediate family engages in such an activity or has such a
relationship. The Cover Person should also obtain written approval by FT's
General Counsel in such situations.

3. Franklin Resources General Counsel and Deputy General Counsel are authorized
to consult, as appropriate, with members of the Audit Committee, counsel to the
FT Funds and counsel to the Independent Directors, and are encouraged to do so.

4. Item 2 of Form N-CSR defines "waiver" as "the approval by the registrant of a
material departure from a provision of the code of ethics" and "implicit
waiver," which must also be disclosed, as "the registrant's failure to take
action within a reasonable period of time regarding a material departure from a
provision of the code of ethics that has been made known to an executive
officer" of the registrant. See Part X.
