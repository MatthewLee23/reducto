Notes to Financial Statements September 30, 2010 (Unaudited)

1. ORGANIZATION

J.P. Morgan Access Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C. (the "Fund"), formerly the J.P.
Morgan Multi-Strategy Fund, L.L.C., was organized as a limited liability company
on April 6, 2004 under the laws of the State of Delaware and is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment company. The Fund's investment objective
is to generate consistent capital appreciation over the long term, with
relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional equity and
fixed-income markets. The Fund will seek to accomplish this objective by
allocating its assets primarily among professionally selected investment funds
("Investment Funds") that are managed by experienced third-party investment
advisers ("Portfolio Managers") who invest in a variety of markets and employ,
as a group, a range of investment techniques and strategies. There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective.

J.P. Morgan Investment Management, Inc. ("JPMIM" or the "Investment Manager"), a
corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ("JPMorgan Chase"), is responsible for the
day-to-day management of the Fund, subject to policies adopted by the Board of
Directors (the "Board"). The Investment Manager has in turn delegated
substantially all investment authority and the allocation of the Fund's assets
among the Investment Funds and other instruments to J.P. Morgan Private
Investments Inc. (the "Sub-Advisor" or "JPMPI"), a corporation formed under the
laws of the State of Delaware and a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase.
The Sub-Advisor will allocate Fund assets among the Investment Funds and other
investments that, in its view, represent attractive investment opportunities.
The Investment Manager also serves as the Managing Member of the Fund (the
"Managing Member").

Both the Investment Manager and the Sub-Advisor are registered as investment
advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers
Act").

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A. USE OF ESTIMATES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Fund in preparation of its financial statements. The policies are in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP"). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires the Investment Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

B. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS

The net asset value of the Fund is determined as of the last day of each month
in accordance with the valuation principles set forth below or as may be
determined from time to time pursuant to policies established by the Board. The
Fund's investments in the Investment Funds are considered to be illiquid and can
only be redeemed periodically. The Board has approved procedures pursuant to
which the Fund values its investments in Investment Funds at fair

value. In accordance with these procedures, fair value as of each month-end
ordinarily is the net asset value determined as of such month-end for each
Investment Fund in accordance with the Investment Fund's valuation policies and
reported at the time of the Fund's valuation.

As a general matter, the fair value of the Fund's interest in an Investment Fund
will represent the amount that the Fund could reasonably expect to receive from
an Investment Fund if the Fund's interest were redeemed at the time of the
valuation, based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation
is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. Considerable judgment is
required to interpret the factors used to develop estimates at fair value. These
factors include, but are not limited to, a review of the underlying securities
of the Investment Fund when available, ongoing due diligence of the style,
strategy and valuation methodology employed by each Investment Fund, and a
review of market inputs that may be expected to impact the performance of a
particular Investment Fund. The use of different factors and estimation
methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair value and
could be material to the financial statements. In the unlikely event that an
Investment Fund does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis,
the Fund would determine the fair value of such Investment Fund based on the
most recent value reported by the Investment Fund, as well as any other relevant
information available at such time. Some of the Investment Funds may invest all
or a portion of their assets in investments which may be illiquid. Some of these
investments are held in "side pockets", sub funds within the Investment Funds,
which provide for their separate liquidation potentially over a much longer
period than the liquidity an investment in the Investment Funds may provide.
Should the Fund seek to liquidate its investment in an Investment Fund which
maintains investments in a side pocket arrangement or which holds substantially
all of its assets in illiquid securities, the Fund might not be able to fully
liquidate its investment without delay, which could be considerable. In such
cases, during the period until the Fund is permitted to fully liquidate its
interest in the Investment Funds, the value of its investment could fluctuate.

The Fund discloses the fair value of its investments in a hierarchy that
prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure the fair value.
Fair value is defined as the price that the Fund would receive to sell an
investment or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with an
independent buyer in the principal market, or in the absence of a principal
market, the most advantageous market for the investment or liability.

Valuations reflected in this report are as of report date. As a result, changes
in valuation due to market events and/or issuer related events after the report
date and prior to issuance of the report are not reflected herein.

The various inputs that are used in determining the fair value of the Fund's
investments are summarized into the three broad levels listed below

     -    Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical
          securities;

     -    Level 2 inputs are other significant observable inputs (including the
          Investment Fund's ability to be redeemed at fair value at the
          reporting date);

     -    Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs and include
          restrictions on redemptions of the Investment Funds due to terms of
          the investment or gates, suspensions, etc. imposed by the investee.

DIVERSIFIED

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy use two or more of the below
strategies. Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 30 -
90 day redemption notice periods. Investment Funds representing approximately
7.1 percent of the fair value of the investments in this strategy are in side
pockets or liquidating trusts. The remaining approximately 92.9 percent of the
Investment Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing in the future
or they can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date.

EVENT DRIVEN - CORE

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy invest in securities of companies
involved in mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, liquidations, spin-offs, or
other special situations that alter a company's financial structure or operating
strategy. Risk management and hedging techniques are typically employed by the
Portfolio Managers to protect the portfolio from deals that fail to materialize.
In addition, accurately forecasting the timing of a transaction is an important
element affecting the realized return. The use of leverage varies. Investment
Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 60 - 90 day redemption
notice periods. Investment Funds representing approximately 12.2 percent of the
fair value of the investments in this strategy are in side pockets or
liquidating trusts. The remaining approximately 87.8 percent of the Investment
Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing in the future or they can
be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date.

EVENT DRIVEN - DISTRESSED

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy invest in debt and equity securities
of companies in financial difficulty, reorganization or bankruptcy,
nonperforming and sub-performing bank loans, and emerging market debt.
Portfolios are usually concentrated in debt instruments. The Portfolio Managers
differ in their preference for

actively participating in the workout and restructuring process and the extent
to which they use leverage. Investment Funds within this strategy are generally
subject to 60 - 95 day redemption notice periods. Investment Funds representing
approximately 4.0 percent of the fair value of the investments in this strategy
are in side pockets or liquidating trusts. The remaining approximately 96.0
percent of the Investment Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing
in the future or they can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement
date.

LONG/SHORT EQUITIES

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy make long and short investments in
equity securities that are deemed by the Portfolio Managers to be under or
overvalued. The Portfolio Managers typically do not attempt to neutralize the
amount of long and short positions (i.e., they will be net long or net short).
The Portfolio Managers may specialize in a particular industry or may allocate
holdings across industries. Although the strategy is more commonly focused on
U.S. markets, a growing number of Portfolio Managers invest globally. Portfolio
Managers in this strategy usually employ a low to moderate degree of leverage.
Investment Funds within this strategy are generally subject to 30 - 90 day
redemption notice periods. Investment Funds representing approximately 2.4
percent of the fair value of the investments in this strategy are in side
pockets or liquidating trusts. The remaining approximately 97.6 percent of the
Investment Funds have either initial redemption dates commencing in the future
or they can be redeemed with no restrictions as of the measurement date.

OPPORTUNISTIC/MACRO

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy invest in a wide variety of
instruments using a broad range of strategies, often assuming an aggressive risk
posture. Most Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy rely on a combination
of macro-economic models and fundamental research to invest across countries,
markets, sectors and companies, and have the flexibility to invest in numerous
financial instruments. Futures and options are often used for hedging and
speculation in order to quickly position a portfolio to profit from changing
markets. The use of leverage varies considerably. Investment Funds within this
strategy are generally subject to 45 - 95 day redemption notice periods.
Investment Funds representing approximately 2.3 percent of the fair value of the
investments in this strategy are in side pockets or liquidating trusts. The
remaining approximately 97.7 percent of the Investment Funds have either initial
redemption dates commencing in the future or they can be redeemed with no
restrictions as of the measurement date.

RELATIVE VALUE

Portfolio Managers utilizing this strategy make simultaneous purchases and sales
of similar securities to exploit pricing differentials or have long exposure in
non-equity oriented beta opportunities (such as credit). The

RELATIVE VALUE (CONTINUED)

Portfolio Managers attempt to neutralize long and short positions to minimize
the impact of general market movements. Different relative value strategies
include convertible bond arbitrage, statistical arbitrage, pairs trading, yield
curve arbitrage and basis trading. The types of instruments traded vary
considerably depending on the Portfolio Manager's relative value strategy.
Because the strategy attempts to capture relatively small mispricings between
two related securities, moderate to substantial leverage is often employed to
produce attractive rates of return. Investment Funds within this strategy are
generally subject to 45 - 180 day redemption notice periods. Investment Funds
representing approximately 34.3 percent of the fair value of the investments in
this strategy are in side pockets or liquidating trusts. The remaining
approximately 65.7 percent of the Investment Funds have either initial
redemption dates commencing in the future or they can be redeemed with no
restrictions as of the measurement date.

Any restriction noted above was imposed at various points throughout the year,
at the discretion of the underlying Investment Funds and the time at which the
restriction might lapse cannot be estimated.

C. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENT FUNDS

Distributions received, whether in the form of cash or securities, are applied
as a reduction of the investment's cost when identified by the Investment Fund
as a return of capital. Once the investment's cost is received, any further
distributions are recognized as realized gains.

D. INCOME RECOGNITION AND SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Dividend income is recorded on
the ex-dividend date. Realized gains and losses from Investment Fund
transactions are calculated on the identified cost basis. Investments are
recorded on the effective date of the subscription in the Investment Fund. All
changes in the value of the Investment Funds are included as unrealized
appreciation or depreciation in the Statement of Operations.

E. FUND EXPENSES

The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business other than those that the
Investment Manager assumes. The expenses of the Fund include, but are not
limited to, the following: all costs and expenses related to investment
transactions and positions for the Fund's account; legal fees; accounting and
auditing fees; custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset value;
costs of insurance; registration expenses; expenses of meetings of the Board and
Members; all costs with respect to communications to Members; and other types of
expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board.

F. INCOME TAXES

The Fund intends to operate and has elected to be treated as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision for the payment of
federal, state or local income taxes has been provided. Each Member is
individually required to report on its own tax return its distributive share of
the Fund's taxable income or loss.

The Investment Manager evaluates tax positions taken or expected to be taken in
the course of preparing the Fund's financial statements to determine whether the
tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable
tax authority. Tax positions with respect to tax at the Fund level not deemed to
meet the "more-likely-than-not" threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or
expense in the current year. The Investment Manager is not aware of any tax
positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of
unrecognized tax benefits or expense will significantly change in the next
twelve months. The Investment Manager's conclusions regarding tax positions will
be subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors
including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of tax laws, regulations and
interpretations thereof.

The Fund's federal tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remains subject
to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Fund recognizes interest and
penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in
the Statement of Operations. During the six months ended September 30, 2010, the
Fund did not incur any interest or penalties.

G. CASH

Cash represents deposits held in an interest bearing account at PNC Bank, N.A.
("PNC"). Amounts in excess of the insurance limit of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") are subject to counter party credit risk should
PNC be unable to fulfill its obligations.

The Fund has entered into an investment management agreement (the "Investment
Management Agreement") with the Investment Manager, effective August 25, 2010.
In consideration of the advisory services provided by the Investment Manager to
the Fund, the Fund pays the Investment Manager a management fee of 1.25% per
year (the "Management Fee"), payable monthly at the rate of 1/12 of 1.25% of the
month- end capital account balance of each Member, before giving effect to
repurchases, Repurchase Fees (if any, as defined below) or the Performance
Allocation (as defined below), but after giving effect to the Fund's other
expenses. The Management Fee is an expense paid out of the Fund's assets. The
Management Fee is paid monthly in arrears within 20 days after the end of each
month. For the period August 25, 2010 through September 30, 2010, the Management
Fee paid to JPMIM totaled $225,291, of which $34,218 was waived.

The Investment Manager, on behalf of the Fund, has entered into an investment
sub-advisory agreement, dated August 25, 2010, with JPMPI. For its services as
sub-advisor, the Investment Manager pays JPMPI a monthly sub-advisory fee of
1.10% of the month end capital balance of each Member of the Fund.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The Sub-Advisor is the special member of the Fund (the "Special Member"). The
Special Member is entitled to all incentive-based performance allocations, if
any, from Members' accounts.

Prior to August 25, 2010, the Fund's investment manager was J.P. Morgan
Alternative Asset Management, Inc. (the "Prior Investment Manager"), a
corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware and an affiliate of
JPMorgan Chase. The Prior Investment Manager provided advisory and other
services. In consideration for such management services, the Fund paid the
Investment Manager a monthly management fee equal to 0.1042% (approximately
1.25% on an annualized basis) and an additional administrative services fee of
0.0125% per month (0.15% on an annualized basis) of end of month Members'
Capital. On August 18, 2010, the Members approved various changes to the
management of the Fund, including authorizing JPMIM to serve as the Investment
Manager and J.P. Morgan Private Investments Inc. ("JPMPI") to serve as the
Sub-Advisor. For the period April 1, 2010 through August 24, 2010, the
Management Fee and Manager Administrative Fee paid to the Prior Investment
Manager totaled $799,282 and $95,882 respectively, none of which was waived.

Pursuant to an Administration Agreement dated August 25, 2010, JPMorgan Funds
Management, Inc. ("JPMFM" or the "Administrator"), an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of JPMorgan, provides certain administration services to the Fund. In
consideration of these services, the Administrator receives a fee (the
"Administration Fee") monthly at the annual rate of 0.15% of the Fund's average
daily net assets. For the period August 25, 2010 through September 30, 2010, the
Administration Fee paid to JPMFM totaled $27,027, none of which was waived.

Effective August 25, 2010, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. ("BNY
Mellon") serves as the Fund's Sub-administrator (the "Sub -administrator"). For
its services as Sub-administrator, BNY Mellon receives a portion of the fees
payable to the Administrator. Prior to August 25, 2010, the Fund had an
administration agreement with BNY Mellon, whereby BNY Mellon provided fund
accounting, investor services and transfer agency functions for the Fund. As
compensation for services set forth herein that were rendered by BNY Mellon
during the term of this Agreement, the Fund paid BNY Mellon an annual fee
ranging from 0.035% to 0.075% of the Fund's average net assets, with a minimum
monthly fee of $5,250 for administration and accounting, an annual fee of 0.015%
of the Fund's average net assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $3,334 for
regulatory administration services, and an annual fee for Member services of
$150 per Member, with a minimum monthly fee of $1,000. For the period April 1,
2010 through August 24, 2010, administration fees paid to BNY Mellon totaled
$175,006, none of which were waived. The amount paid directly to BNY Mellon by
the Fund for these services is included in Administration fees on the Statement
of Operations.

On July 1, 2010, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. sold the outstanding
stock of PNC Global Investment Servicing Inc. to The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation. At the closing of the sale, PNC Global Investment Servicing (U.S.)
Inc. changed its name to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.

3. MANAGEMENT FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

PFPC Trust Company ("PFPC Trust"), which will be renamed BNY Mellon Investment
Servicing Trust Company effective July 1, 2011, serves as custodian of the
Fund's assets and provides custodial services to the Fund. As compensation for
services, the Fund pays PFPC Trust an annual fee of 0.005% of the Fund's average
gross assets, with a minimum monthly fee of $795.

The Investment Manager or an affiliate of the Investment Manager have
contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse the Fund to the extent that
total annual operating expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses,
interest, brokerage commissions, other transaction-related expenses and any
extraordinary expenses as well as any Performance Allocation) exceed 1.92% on an
annualized basis of the Fund's net assets as of the end of each month.

Prior to August 25, 2010, the Fund and the Prior Investment Manager had
contractually agreed to waive fees, and if necessary, reimburse expenses in
respect of the Fund for each fiscal year that the agreement was in place so that
the total operating expenses of the Fund (excluding interest, brokerage
commissions, other transaction-related expenses and any extraordinary expenses
of the Fund as well as any Performance Allocation) did not exceed 2.30% on an
annualized basis of the Fund's net assets as of the end of each month.

Certain officers of the Fund are affiliated with the Advisor and the
Administrator. Such officers, with the exception of the Chief Compliance
Officer, receive no compensation from the Fund for serving in their respective
roles.

Effective August 25, 2010, the Fund adopted a Director Deferred Compensation
Plan (the "Plan") which allows the Independent Directors to defer the receipt of
all or a portion of compensation related to performance of their duties as a
Trustee. The deferred fees are invested in various J.P. Morgan Funds until
distribution in accordance with the Plan.

4. LINE OF CREDIT

From time to time, the Fund may borrow cash from a major institution under a
credit agreement up to a maximum of 10 % of the Fund's total assets with a cap
of $8 million. Interest is payable on any outstanding balance at LIBOR plus
Margin (1.90%). During the six months ended September 30, 2010, the Fund had 31
days during the period in which it utilized the credit facility. During those 31
days, the average borrowings outstanding of approximately $2,382,258 at an
average interest rate of 2.19%. There was no loan payable outstanding on
September 30, 2010. Credit facility fees incurred for the six months ended
September 30, 2010 amounted to $28,094, which is included in the Statement of
Operations.

5. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

Aggregate purchases and sales of Investment Funds for the six months ended
September 30, 2010 amounted to $31,955,523 and $39,287,973, respectively.

Notes to Financial Statements September 30, 2010 (Unaudited) (continued)

5. SECURITY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

At September 30, 2010, the estimated cost of investments for federal income tax
purposes was substantially the same as the cost for financial reporting
purposes. Accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation on investments was
$19,160,256 and gross unrealized depreciation was $6,523,012, resulting in net
unrealized appreciation of $12,637,244.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION

Generally, initial and additional subscription for interests by eligible
investors may be accepted at such times as the Fund may determine. The Fund
reserves the right to reject any subscriptions for interests in the Fund. The
initial acceptance for subscriptions for Interests was August 1, 2004 (the
"Initial Closing Date"). After the Initial Closing Date, the Fund generally
accepts subscriptions for interests ("Interests") as of the first day of each
month.

The Fund from time to time may offer to repurchase Interests pursuant to written
tenders by Members. These repurchases will be made at such times, and in such
amounts, and on such terms as may be determined by the Board, in its sole
discretion. The Investment Manager and the Managing Member expect to typically
recommend to the Board that the Fund offer to repurchase Interests from Members
of up to 25% of the Fund's net assets quarterly, effective as of the last day of
March, June, September, and December. A 1.5% repurchase fee (the "Repurchase
Fee") payable to the Fund will be charged for repurchases of Members' Interests
at any time prior to the day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of a
Member's purchase of its Interests. For the six months ended September 30, 2010,
the Fund did not charge any Repurchase Fees to Members.

At the end of each Allocation Period of the Fund, any net capital appreciation
or net capital depreciation of the Fund (both realized and unrealized), as the
case may be, is allocated to the capital accounts of all of the Members
(including the Special Member and the Managing Member) in proportion to their
respective opening capital account balances for such Allocation Period. The
initial "Allocation Period" began on the Initial Closing Date, with each
subsequent Allocation Period beginning immediately after the close of the
preceding Allocation Period. Each Allocation Period closes on the first to occur
of (1) the last day of each month, (2) the date immediately prior to the
effective date of (a) the admission of a new Member or (b) an increase in a
Member's capital contribution, (3) the effective date of any repurchase of
Interests, or (4) the date when the Fund dissolves.

At the end of each calendar year, each Member's return on investment for the
year is determined and a portion of the net capital appreciation allocated to
each Member's capital account during the year (the "Performance Allocation"),
net of the Member's allocable share of the Management Fee and the Manager
Administrative Services Fee, equal to 10% of the portion of such net capital
appreciation that exceeds the Preferred Return (as defined below) will be
reallocated to the capital account of the Special Member. The "Preferred Return"
is equal to the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield (as defined below) for each
month during the relevant calendar year (or any shorter period of calculation).
The "3-month U.S. Treasury Bill yield" for any month shall equal one-twelfth of
the annual yield for the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill for the first business day
of the then current calendar quarter as set forth in the U.S. Federal Reserve
Statistical Release H.15(519) under the caption "Treasury constant maturities",
or if such measurement is not available, such other source as the Managing
Member may determine appropriate in its discretion.

6. CONTRIBUTIONS, REDEMPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION (CONTINUED)

No Performance Allocation is made, however, with respect to a Member's capital
account until any cumulative net capital depreciation previously allocated to
such Member's capital account plus any Management Fees and Manager
Administrative Service Fees charged to such capital account (the "Loss
Carryforward") have been recovered. Any Loss Carryforward of a Member is reduced
proportionately to reflect the repurchase of any portion of that Member's
Interest. Upon a repurchase of an Interest (other than at the end of a calendar
year) from a Member, a Performance Allocation will be determined and allocated
to the Special Member, and in the case of any repurchase of a partial Interest,
on a "first in - first out" basis (i.e., the portion of the Interest being
repurchased and the amount with respect to which the Performance Allocation is
calculated) will be deemed to have been taken from the first capital
contribution of such Member (as such contribution has been adjusted for net
capital appreciation or depreciation, Management Fees, Manager Administrative
Services Fees and other expenses) until it is decreased to zero and from each
subsequent capital contribution until such contribution (as adjusted) is
decreased to zero.

As of December 31, 2009, $117,764 was reallocated to the capital account of the
Special Member. As of March 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010 additional amounts
of $620 and $2,968, respectively, were reallocated to the capital account of the
Special Member resulting from Members tendering Interests for repurchase as of
such dates. Based upon profits for the period January 1, 2010 to September 30,
2010, the additional Performance Allocation that would be reallocated to the
Special Member is $86,027. This amount is subject to change as Performance
Allocations occur at the end of each calendar year.

7. RISK EXPOSURE

In the normal course of business, the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to,
short-selling activities, writing option contracts, contracts for differences,
and interest rate, credit default and total return equity swaps contracts. The
Fund's risk of loss in these Investment Funds is limited to the value of the
Fund's investments in the Investment Funds.

In pursuing its investment objectives, the Fund invests in Investment Funds that
are not registered under the 1940 Act. These Investment Funds may utilize
diverse investment strategies, which are not generally managed against
traditional investment indices. The Investment Funds selected by the Fund will
invest in and actively trade securities and other financial instruments using a
variety of strategies and investment techniques that may involve significant
risks. Such risks arise from the volatility of the equity, fixed income,
commodity and currency markets, leverage both on and off balance sheet
associated with borrowings, short sales and derivative instruments, the
potential illiquidity of certain instruments including emerging markets, private
transactions, derivatives, and counterparty and broker defaults. Various risks
are also associated with an investment in the Fund, including risks relating to
the multi-manager structure of the Fund, risks relating to compensation
arrangements and risks related to limited liquidity of the Interests. The
Investment Funds provide for periodic redemptions ranging from monthly to
annually, and may be subject to various lock-up provisions and early withdrawal
fees.

Notes to Financial Statements September 30, 2010 (Unaudited) (continued)

7. RISK EXPOSURE (CONTINUED)

The investments of the Investment Funds are subject to normal market
fluctuations and other risks inherent in investing in securities and there can
be no assurance that any appreciation in value will occur. The value of
investments can fall as well as rise and investors may not realize the amount
that they invest.

Although the Investment Manager will seek to select Investment Funds that offer
the opportunity to have their shares or units redeemed within a reasonable
timeframe, there can be no assurance that the liquidity of the investments of
such Investment Funds will always be sufficient to meet redemption requests as,
and when, made.

The Investment Manager may invest the Fund's assets in Investment Funds that
invest in illiquid securities and do not permit frequent withdrawals. Illiquid
securities owned by Investment Funds are riskier than liquid securities because
the Investment Funds may not be able to dispose of the illiquid securities if
their investment performance deteriorates, or may be able to dispose of the
illiquid securities only at a greatly reduced price. Similarly, the illiquidity
of the Investment Funds may cause Members to incur losses because of an
inability to withdraw their investments from the Fund during or following
periods of negative performance.

The Investment Funds may invest in the securities of foreign companies that
involve special risks and considerations not typically associated with investing
in U.S. companies. These risks include devaluation of currencies, less reliable
information about issuers, different securities transaction clearance and
settlement practices, and future adverse political and economic developments.
Moreover, securities of many foreign companies and their markets may be less
liquid and their prices more volatile than those securities of comparable U.S.
companies.

8. INDEMNIFICATIONS

In the normal course of business, the Fund enters into contracts that contain a
variety of representations that provide general indemnifications. The Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve
future claims that may be made against the Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, the Fund expects the risk of loss to be remote.

9. CONCENTRATIONS

One or more affiliate of the Fund's Investment Manager have investment
discretion with respect to their client's holdings in the Fund, which
collectively represent a significant portion of the Fund's assets. Significant
Member transactions, if any, may impact the Fund's performance.

Board Approval of New Investment Management Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement
(unaudited)

At multiple meetings of the Board of Directors ("Board") in May and June 2010,
the Board reviewed and considered the proposal to replace the current Board with
the same directors who supervise and oversee the funds in the J.P.Morgan Funds
Complex, and the proposed New Investment Management Agreement and Sub-Advisory
Agreement to determine whether they should be approved with respect to the Fund
(collectively, the "Internal Reorganization"). Pursuant to the proposed New
Investment Management Agreement, J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.
("JPMIM") would replace J.P. Morgan Alternative Asset Management Inc. ("JPMAAM")
to provide or procure investment management services on behalf of the Fund, and
JPMIM would retain J.P. Morgan Private Investment Inc. ("JPMPI") to provide
sub-advisory services to the Fund. Following their review and consideration, the
Board determined that the proposed New Investment Management Agreement and the
Sub-Advisory Agreement will enable Members of the Fund to obtain high quality
services at a cost that is appropriate, reasonable and in their best interests.
The Board, including the Independent Directors, approved the New Investment
Management Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement for the Fund and the
appointment of JPMIM as the Fund's new investment manager and JPMPI as the
Fund's sub-adviser.

In reaching its decision, the Board requested information from, and was
furnished information by, JPMAAM, JPMIM and JPMPI, as each deemed reasonably
necessary for the Board to evaluate the New Investment Management Agreement and
the Sub-Advisory Agreement for the Fund. The Board evaluated a number of factors
and considerations listed below that it believed, in light of its own business
judgment, to be relevant to its determination.

1. The Board considered the reputation, financial strength and resources of
JPMIM, one of the world's leading independent global investment management
firms, the strength of JPMIM's resources and investment capabilities and the
client-focused Member services offered by JPMIM.

2. The Board noted that the Fund would continue to be managed by a JPMorgan
Asset Management affiliate.

3. The Board noted that entering into the Sub-Advisory Agreement with JPMPI will
give the Fund access, at least comparable to the Fund's current access under the
investment management agreement with JPMAAM ("Current Investment Management
Agreement"), to portfolio managers and investment personnel who have specialized
hedge fund expertise in performing research and due diligence on hedge fund
advisers, the ability to monitor the performance of hedge fund advisers and
identify new investment opportunities, and in portfolio management of hedge fund
assets.

4. The Board noted that the management fee payable to JPMIM and the performance
allocation payable to JPMPI will be the same as are currently in effect for the
Fund. The Board also noted that JPMIM would not receive the 0.15% per year
administrative services fee currently being paid to JPMAAM because all
administrative services would be provided a new administrator, JPMorgan Funds
Management Inc. ("JPMFM"), and the current administrator PNC Global Investment
Services (U.S.) Inc., ("PNC"). JPMFM, an affiliate of JPMIM and JPMPI, will be
entitled to receive a similar

                 J.P. MORGAN ACCESS MULTI-STRATEGY FUND, L.L.C.

Board Approval of New Investment Management Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement
(unaudited) (continued)

0.15% per year fee for its administrative services. The Board considered the
allocation of services and fees between JPMFM and PNC, to the extent PNC would
be providing sub-administration services after the Internal Reorganization, and
concluded that JPMFM would not receive inappropriate benefits from the new
arrangements.

5. The Board noted the undertaking by JPMAAM or its affiliates to assume all of
the costs and expenses of preparing, printing, and mailing a proxy statement and
related solicitation expenses, and certain other expenses directly attributable
to the Internal Reorganization. In determining the obligation to waive advisory
fees and/or reimburse expenses, the following is not taken into account: (i)
interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) extraordinary or non-routine items, and (iv)
expenses that the Fund has incurred but did not actually pay because of an
offset arrangement.

During the Board's extensive review process, the Board, including the
Independent Directors, considered, among other things, the following factors:
the terms and conditions of the proposed New Investment Management Agreement,
including the differences from the Current Investment Management Agreement; and
the nature, scope and quality of services that JPMIM and JPMPI are expected to
provide to the Fund, including compliance services. The Board evaluated all
information available to them. The Board also based its decision on the
following considerations, among others, although they did not identify any that
was all important or controlling of its discussions, and each Director
attributed different weights to the various factors.

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES. The Board reviewed and considered the
nature and extent of the investment advisory services to be provided by JPMIM
and JPMPI under the New Investment Management Agreement and Sub-Advisory
Agreement, including portfolio management and investment research. The Board was
advised that there was no expected diminution in the nature, quality and extent
of advisory services provided to the Fund. The Board considered the experience
of the J.P. Morgan Funds Complex with JPMIM, as the primary investment adviser
of those funds, and JPMPI, which has provided investment advisory services with
respect to certain of those funds. The Board received information about JPMIM's
and JPMPI's significant experience with respect to alternative investment
strategies and diligence of hedge fund investments, and the substantial
resources, including personnel, that each could provide with respect to the
Fund. The Board was informed that personnel of JPMAAM would remain available
informally to provide any requested support during the transition.

The Board reviewed and considered the qualifications of, and met with, the
personnel proposed to serve as portfolio managers. The Board discussed the
transition with the President of the J.P. Morgan Funds Complex, and met with
certain board members of the J.P. Morgan Funds Complex to review, among other
things, information from them about their experience in having JPMIM and JPMPI
provide investment advisory services with respect to the J.P. Morgan Funds
Complex. The Board reviewed information about JPMIM's approach to risk
management and related processes. The Board also reviewed and considered the
qualifications of the senior administrative managers and other key personnel of
JPMIM, JPMPI, and JPMFM, which are proposed to provide administrative services
to the Fund.

Board Approval of New Investment Management Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement
(unaudited) (continued)

PERFORMANCE, FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND. The Board noted that JPMIM and JPMPI
had not yet begun providing services to the Fund and, therefore, concluded that
the Fund's past performance was not a factor they needed to address with respect
to the approval of the New Investment Management Agreement and Sub-Advisory
Agreement. The Board considered the capabilities of JPMIM and JPMPI with respect
to managing similar funds, and noted that it had previously considered
comparative and competitive fund fee information. The Board noted the complexity
of comparing fees that include a performance-based component. The Board also
considered that management fees would not increase under the New Investment
Management Agreement, that the performance allocation would not increase and
that the administrative services fee payable under the Current Investment
Management Agreement would remain the same but be payable to JPMFM. Furthermore,
the Board asked for and JPMIM agreed to provide a one-year contractual
undertaking that will limit the total expense ratio of the Fund to 1.92%. This
expense limitation will be in effect for the period beginning August 25, 2010 to
August 24, 2011. This expense limitation will terminate on August 25, 2011
unless renewed by JPMIM and JPMPI. The Board was informed that the fee
arrangements were not expected to have a material effect on the profitability of
JPMIM or JPMPI.

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER/TAX CONSEQUENCES. The Board considered that after the
Effective Date, it is anticipated that JPMIM and/or JPMPI will make changes to
the Fund's investments, which could result in greater portfolio turnover than if
the Current Investment Manager had continued to manage the Fund's investments.
Any such increase in portfolio turnover could have an adverse tax consequence
for Members. The Board received information that portfolio management parameters
would be maintained with a view to reducing the risk of disruption during the
transition to the new portfolio managers.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board considered the benefits that the Members of the
Fund may be afforded as a result of anticipated economies of scale in that the
Fund would be distributed as part of J.P. Morgan's Global Access platform, with
an intended result of greater Fund assets, although such a result cannot be
assured. The Board acknowledged certain breakpoints in the fees applicable to
certain of the fund administration arrangements, and that certain expenses such
as directors' fees will be shared with the J.P. Morgan Funds Complex, which do
not relate directly to an investment advisory agreement but are savings that can
be attributed to the Internal Reorganization overall. The Board also considered,
as noted above, the one-year expense limitation agreement. Finally, the Board
asked JPMIM to consider the merits of a management fee arrangement that provides
for reduced fees at higher Fund asset levels (commonly known as breakpoints),
and considered JPMIM's response that JPMIM did not believe breakpoints were
common or appropriate in this market and that fee levels could be reassessed as
Fund assets grew.

OTHER BENEFITS OF THE RELATIONSHIP. The Board considered other benefits to
JPMIM, JPMPI and their affiliates that may be derived from their relationship
with the Fund and other funds advised by JPMIM, such as potential benefits to
the relationships between the JPMorgan Private Bank and its clients who seek
alternative investment opportunities through the "Global Access" suite of
products in which the Fund would be included.

Board Approval of New Investment Management Agreement and Sub-Advisory Agreement
(unaudited) (continued)

RESOURCES OF JPMIM AND JPMPI. The Board considered whether JPMIM and JPMPI are
financially sound and have the resources necessary to perform their obligations
under the New Investment Management Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement,
respectively, noting assurances that each has the financial resources necessary
to fulfill its obligations under the New Investment Management Agreement and the
benefits to the Fund of such a relationship. The Board reviewed information
about the currently proposed federal financial reform legislation and its
potential effects on the Fund. JPMAAM and JPMIM both indicated to the Board that
they did not currently expect a material adverse effect on the Fund's management
from the legislation. The Board also acknowledged that such effects could not be
fully anticipated as the legislation was not yet in final form, and any
implementing rules of the SEC or other regulators would not be issued for some
time after enactment of the legislation.

GENERAL CONCLUSION. After considering and weighing all of the above factors, the
Board, including the Independent Directors, unanimously concluded that it would
be in the best interests of the Fund and its Members to approve the New
Investment Management Agreement and the Sub-Advisory Agreement. In reaching this
conclusion, the Board did not give particular weight to any single factor
referenced above. The Board considered these factors over the course of multiple
meetings, some of which were in executive session with only the Independent
Directors and their counsel present.

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser provide investment management services to
other clients, including other multi-manager funds and discretionary managed
accounts, that follow investment programs substantially similar to that of the
Fund. As a result, when a limited investment opportunity would be appropriate
for the Fund and also for one or more of its other clients, the Investment
Manager and Sub-Adviser will be required to choose among the Fund and such other
clients in allocating such opportunity, or to allocate less of such opportunity
to the Fund than the Investment Manager or Sub-Adviser would ideally allocate if
it did not provide investment management services to other clients. In addition,
the Investment Manager and/or Sub-Adviser may determine that an investment
opportunity is appropriate for a particular client, or for itself or an
affiliate, but not for the Fund. Situations may arise in which other client
accounts managed by the Investment Manager and/or Sub-Adviser or its affiliates
have made investments that would have been suitable for investment by the Fund
but, for various reasons, were not pursued by, or available to, the Fund. The
Investment Manager and Sub-Adviser attempt to allocate limited investment
opportunities among the Fund and their other client accounts in a manner they
believe to be reasonable and equitable.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER COMPENSATION

The Adviser's portfolio managers participate in a competitive compensation
program that is designed to attract and retain outstanding people and closely
link the performance of investment professionals to client investment
objectives. The total compensation program includes a base salary fixed from
year to year and a variable performance bonus consisting of cash incentives and
restricted stock and may include mandatory notional investments (as described
below) in selected mutual funds advised by the Adviser or its affiliates. These
elements reflect individual performance and the performance of the Adviser's
business as a whole.

<PAGE>

Each portfolio manager's performance is formally evaluated annually based on a
variety of factors including the aggregate size and blended performance of the
portfolios such portfolio manager manages. Individual contribution relative to
client goals carries the highest impact. Portfolio manager compensation is
primarily driven by meeting or exceeding clients' risk and return objectives,
relative performance to competitors or competitive indices and compliance with
firm policies and regulatory requirements. In evaluating each portfolio
manager's performance with respect to the mutual funds he or she manages, the
Funds' pre-tax performance is compared to the appropriate market peer group and
to each Fund's benchmark index listed in the Fund's prospectuses over one, three
and five year periods (or such shorter time as the portfolio manager has managed
the Fund). Investment performance is generally more heavily weighted to the
long-term.

Awards of restricted stock are granted as part of an employee's annual
performance bonus and comprise from 0% to 40% of a portfolio manager's total
bonus. As the level of incentive compensation increases, the percentage of
compensation awarded in restricted stock also increases. Up to 50% of the
restricted stock portion of a portfolio manager's bonus may instead be subject
to mandatory notional investment in selected mutual funds advised by the Adviser
or its affiliates. When these awards vest over time, the portfolio manager
receives cash equal to the market value of the notional investment in the
selected mutual funds.

SECURITIES OWNERSHIP OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TEAM

As of September 30, 2010, none of the persons involved in the management of the
Fund's portfolio beneficially owns any interest in the Fund.

Not applicable.

ITEM 10. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.

When evaluating a person as a potential nominee to serve as an Independent
Director, the Governance Committee of the Fund's Board of Directors may
consider, among other factors, (i) whether or not the person is "independent"
and whether the person is otherwise qualified under applicable laws and
regulations to serve as a Director; (ii) whether or not the person is willing to
serve, and willing and able to commit the time necessary for the performance of
the duties of an Independent Director; (iii) the contribution that the person
can make to the Board and the J.P. Morgan Funds, with consideration being given
to the person's business experience, education and such other factors as the
Committee may consider relevant; (iv) the character and integrity of the person;
(v) the desirable personality traits, including independence, leadership and the
ability to work with the other members of the Board; and (vi) to the extent
consistent with the Investment Company Act of 1940, such recommendations from
management as are deemed appropriate. The process of identifying nominees
involves the consideration of candidates recommended by one or more of the
following: current Independent Directors, officers, Members and other sources
that the Governance Committee deems appropriate. The Governance

<PAGE>

Committee will review nominees recommended to the Board by Members and will
evaluate such nominees in the same manner as it evaluates nominees identified by
the Governance Committee. Nominee recommendations may be submitted to the
