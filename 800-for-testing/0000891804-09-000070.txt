Chairman's
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS


|  Robert P. Bremner  |  Chairman of the Board


Dear Shareholders,

I'd like to use my initial letter to you to accomplish several things. First, I
want to report that after fourteen years of service on your Fund's Board,
including the last twelve as chairman, Tim Schwertfeger retired from the Board
in June. The Board has elected me to replace him as the chairman, the first time
this role has been filled by someone who is not an employee of Nuveen
Investments. Electing an independent chairman marks a significant milestone in
the management of your Fund, and it aligns us with what is now considered a
"best practice" in the fund industry. Further, it demonstrates the independence
with which your Board has always acted on your behalf.

Following Tim will not be easy. During my eleven previous years on the Nuveen
Fund Board, I found that Tim always set a very high standard by combining
insightful industry and market knowledge and sound, clear judgment. While the
Board will miss his wise counsel, I am certain we will retain the primary
commitment Tim shared with all of us - an unceasing dedication to creating and
retaining value for Nuveen Fund shareholders. This focus on value over time is a
touchstone that I and all the other Board members will continue to use when
making decisions on your behalf.

Second, I also want to report that we are very fortunate to welcome two new
Board members to our team. John Amboian, the current chairman and CEO of Nuveen
Investments, has replaced Tim as Nuveen's representative on the Board. John's
presence will allow the independent Board members to benefit not only from his
leadership role at Nuveen but also his broad understanding of the fund industry
and Nuveen's role within it. We also added Terry Toth as an independent
director. A former CEO of the Northern Trust Company's asset management group,
Terry will bring extensive experience in the fund industry to our deliberations.

Third, on behalf of the entire Board, I would like you to know that we are
closely monitoring the unprecedented market developments and their distressing
impact on the Funds. We believe that these Funds continue to be actively and
constructively managed for the long term and at the same time we are very aware
that these are trying times for our investors. We appreciate the patience you
have shown with the Board and with Nuveen Investments as they manage your
investment through this extremely difficult period.

Fourth, again on behalf of the entire Board, I would like to acknowledge the
effort the whole Nuveen organization is making to resolve the auction rate
preferred share situation in a satisfactory manner. As you know, we are actively
pursuing a number of possible solutions, all with the goal of providing
liquidity for preferred shareholders while preserving the potential benefits of
leverage for common shareholders. We appreciate the patience you have shown as
we've worked through the many difficulties involved.

Finally, I urge you to take the time to review the Portfolio Managers' Comments,
the Common Share Dividend and Share Price Information, and the Performance
Overview sections of this report. All of us are grateful that you have chosen
Nuveen Investments as a partner as you pursue your financial goals, and, on
behalf of myself and the other members of your Fund's Board, let me say we look
forward to continuing to earn your trust in the months and years ahead.

Sincerely,

/s/ Robert P. Bremner

Robert P. Bremner
Chairman of the Board

Portfolio Managers' COMMENTS

Nuveen Investments Municipal Closed-End Funds   |   NPP, NMA, NMO
                                                    NAD, NXZ, NZF

Portfolio managers Tom Spalding and Paul Brennan discuss U.S. economic and
municipal market conditions, key investment strategies, and the twelve-month
performance of these six national Funds. A thirty-two-year veteran of Nuveen,
Tom has managed NXZ since its inception in 2001 and NPP, NMA, NMO, and NAD since
2003. With nineteen years of industry experience, including eleven years at
Nuveen, Paul assumed portfolio management responsibility for NZF in 2006.


WHAT FACTORS AFFECTED THE U.S. ECONOMY AND MUNICIPAL MARKET DURING THE
TWELVE-MONTH REPORTING PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2008?

During this period, stress in the financial and credit markets led to increased
price volatility for many securities, reduced liquidity and a general flight to
quality. The Federal Reserve (Fed) began in September 2007 a series of interest
rate cuts that lowered the fed funds rate by 325 basis points--from 5.25% to
2.00%--over an eight-month period ending April 2008. In October 2008, the Fed
announced two additional reductions of 50 basis points each, bringing the fed
funds rate down to 1.00%, its lowest level since 2003. (On December 16, after
the end of this twelve-month period, the Fed reduced the fed funds rate target
to 0.25% or less.)

The Fed's rate-cutting actions also were a response to concerns about the pace
of U.S. economic growth, as measured by the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).
After declining at an annual rate of 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2007, GDP
improved to a positive 0.9% in the first quarter of 2008 and posted growth of
2.8% in the second quarter of 2008 (all GDP numbers annualized). During the
third quarter of 2008, however, GDP contracted at an annual rate of 0.5%, the
biggest decrease since 2001, mainly as the result of the first decline in
consumer spending since 1991 and an 18% drop in residential investment. The
Consumer Price Index (CPI), driven largely by increased energy, food and
transportation prices, registered a 3.7% year-over-year gain as of October 2008,
while the core CPI (which excludes food and energy) rose 2.2% over this same
period, above the Fed's unofficial target of 2.0% or lower. In the labor
markets, October 2008 marked the tenth consecutive month of job losses. The
national unemployment rate for October 2008 was 6.5%, its highest point in more
than fourteen years, up from 4.8% in October 2007.

In the municipal bond market, performance was significantly impacted by concerns
about the credit markets, downgrades of municipal bond insurers, failed auctions
of preferred shares and institutional investors' need to unwind various
leveraging strategies. These events created surges of selling pressure,
especially in late September and early October 2008. While some investors
curtailed purchases, non-traditional buyers of

municipal bonds such as hedge funds, traditional buyers such as tax-exempt money
market funds, and institutions were forced to sell holdings of longer-maturity
bonds into a market already experiencing reduced liquidity.

Combined with the Fed rate cuts, this selling produced a sharp steepening of the
municipal yield curve, as longer-term interest rates rose and short-term rates
declined over this period. In this environment, bonds with shorter maturities
generally outperformed longer maturity bonds, and higher quality bonds tended to
outperform lower quality credits.

Another item of note in the municipal market was the U.S. Supreme Court's May
2008 ruling that individual states could continue to offer their residents
special tax treatment on municipal bonds issued within their borders. The high
court's decision preserved tax rules in forty-two states, allowing them to
continue to exempt from taxation the income their residents earn on in-state
municipal bonds while taxing the income earned on municipal bonds issued in
other states.

Over the twelve months ended October 31, 2008, municipal bond issuance
nationwide totaled $450.3 billion, a drop of 8% from the previous twelve months.
In 2008, insured bonds comprised less than 20% of new supply, compared with the
recent historical figure of approximately 50%. While market conditions during
this period impacted the demand for municipal bonds, we continued to see demand
from investors attracted by higher interest rates and yields relative to taxable
bonds.


WHAT KEY STRATEGIES WERE USED TO MANAGE THESE FUNDS DURING THIS REPORTING
PERIOD?

During this twelve-month period, with the municipal market characterized by
volatility and a relatively steep yield curve, we sought to capitalize on a
turbulent environment by continuing to focus on relative value and investing for
the long term, preserving and enhancing liquidity, and managing duration(1)
risk.

As events in the general financial markets unfolded, we found attractive
opportunities in various sectors of the municipal market, using a fundamental
approach to identify undervalued sectors and individual credits with the
potential to perform well over the long term. Among the bonds we added during
this period were health care and housing issues that we believed were
attractively priced and had good credit fundamentals. Some of the Funds also
added tobacco bonds to bring their allocations in line with the market.

In addition, some portfolio activity was driven by our efforts to boost
liquidity or cash reserves. Especially during the commotion of September and
October, we believed that it was prudent to take defensive measures that would
reduce the Funds' exposure to market risk. These measures included pre-emptively
selling some holdings and raising the Funds' cash reserves. Throughout the
period, we selectively sold holdings with shorter durations, including
pre-refunded(2) bonds. We also took advantage of strong bids to sell bonds that
were attractive to the retail market. Given the market environment, retail
demand was often strongest for higher credit quality bonds. At all times, we


(1)  Duration is a measure of a bond's price sensitivity as interest rates
     change, with longer duration bonds displaying more sensitivity to these
     changes than bonds with shorter durations.

(2)  Pre-refundings, also known as advance refundings or refinancings, occur
     when an issuer sells new bonds and uses the proceeds to fund principal and
     interest payments of older existing bonds. This process often results in
     lower borrowing costs for bond issuers.

were careful to balance our efforts to enhance liquidity through sales to the
retail market with our focus on maintaining the credit quality of our portfolios
in an uncertain market. Some of our new purchases were also funded by
reinvesting the proceeds from called or matured bonds.

As a key dimension of risk management, we employed a disciplined approach to
duration positioning as an important component of our overall strategy. As part
of this approach, we used inverse floating rate securities(3), in all six of
these Funds. Inverse floaters typically provide the dual benefit of bringing the
Funds' durations closer to our strategic target and enhancing their
income-generation capabilities. NZF also used certain derivative instruments in
an effort to lengthen its duration and help manage common share net asset value
(NAV) volatility while trying to minimize any negative impact on its income
stream or common share dividends over the short term. As of October 31, 2008, we
continued to use inverse floaters in all of these Funds and the derivatives
remained in place in NZF.

(3)  An inverse floating rate security is a financial instrument designed to pay
     long-term tax-exempt interest at a rate that varies inversely with a
     short-term tax-exempt interest rate index. For the Nuveen Funds, the index
     typically used is the Securities Industry and Financial Markets (SIFM)
     Municipal Swap Index (previously referred to as the Bond Market Association
     Index or BMA). Inverse floaters, including those inverse floating rate
     securities in which the Funds invested during this reporting period, are
     further defined within the Notes to Financial Statements and Glossary of
     Terms Used in this Report sections of this shareholder report.

(4)  The Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds Average is calculated
     using the returns of all closed-end funds in this category for each period
     as follows: 1 year, 54 funds; 5 years, 52 funds; and 10 years, 38 funds.
     Fund and Lipper returns assume reinvestment of dividends.

(5)  The Barclays Capital (formerly Lehman Brothers) Municipal Bond Index is an
     unleveraged, unmanaged national index comprising a broad range of
     investment-grade municipal bonds. Results for the Barclays Capital index do
     not reflect any expenses.

(6)  The Standard & Poor's (S&P) National Municipal Bond Index is an
     unleveraged, market value-weighted index designed to measure the
     performance of the investment-grade U.S. municipal bond market.


                                       6

<PAGE>

For the twelve months ended October 31, 2008, the total returns on common share
NAV for all six of the Funds in this report exceeded the average return for the
Lipper General Leveraged Municipal Debt Funds Average. The Funds underperformed
the Barclays Capital Municipal Bond Index and the Standard & Poor's (S&P)
National Municipal Bond Index.

Key management factors that influenced the Funds' returns included duration
positioning, the use of derivatives, credit exposure and sector allocations. In
addition, a major factor affecting each Fund's performance over this period was
the use of leverage. The impact of leverage is discussed in more detail on page
eight.

Given the changes in the interest rate environment during this period, bonds in
the Barclays Capital Municipal Bond Index with maturities of ten years or less
outperformed the market as a whole, with bonds maturing in one to six years
benefiting the most. Because they were less sensitive to interest rate changes,
these shorter bonds generally outperformed credits with longer maturities, with
the biggest losses posted by bonds with the longest maturities (twenty-two years
and longer). In general, the greater the Fund's exposure to the underperforming
longer part of the yield curve, the greater the negative impact on the Fund's
return. Overall, among these six Funds, NAD was the most heavily weighted in the
longer part of the curve, while NMO had the smallest exposure to this part of
the curve.

As mentioned earlier, NZF used derivative positions throughout this period to
synthetically extend duration and move it closer to our strategic duration
target. Despite the fact that longer duration municipal bonds generally
underperformed those with shorter durations, the use of these derivatives had a
positive impact on NZF's total return performance. This positive impact was
attributable to the fact that the derivative positions provided exposure to
taxable markets during a period when the taxable securities performed relatively
well when compared with their non-taxable counterparts.

However, the inverse floaters used by all six of these Funds generally had a
negative impact on performance. This resulted from the fact that the inverse
floaters effectively increased the Funds' exposure to longer maturity bonds at a
time when shorter maturities were in favor in the market.

Credit exposure, including exposure to bonds backed by municipal bond insurers,
also was a factor in performance during this period. Because risk-averse
investors generally sought higher quality investments as disruptions in the
financial markets deepened, bonds with higher credit quality ratings typically
performed very well. However, insured bonds with underlying credits that were
rated BBB or non-rated, originally purchased because of the higher yields they
offered, experienced a disproportionately negative impact (compared with bonds
with underlying credits rated AA or A ) if the insurer backing the bond was
downgraded from AAA. As many investors avoided high-yield securities, bonds
rated BBB or below and non-rated bonds generally posted poor returns. As of
October 31, 2008, allocations of bonds rated BBB or lower and


                                       7

<PAGE>

non-rated bonds accounted for approximately 9% of NMO's portfolio, 13% of NAD,
14% of NPP and NZF, 16% of NMA and 19% of NXZ. This lower-rated credit exposure,
which was generally higher than that of the Barclays Capital Municipal Bond
Index, was a negative influence on Funds' performances for this period.
Conversely, the Funds' weightings in bonds rated AAA were generally positive for
performance.

Sectors of the market that generally contributed positively to the Funds'
performances included general obligation bonds, resource recovery, water and
sewer, and utilities. Pre-refunded bonds, which are usually backed by U.S.
Treasury securities, were one of the top performing segments of the market, due
primarily to their shorter effective maturities, higher credit quality, and
perceived safety. Holdings of pre-refunded bonds ranged from 18% to 40% among
these Funds, with NMO having the heaviest weighting of pre-refunded issues and
NAD the smallest.

In general, bonds that carried any credit risk, regardless of sector, continued
to post weak performance. Revenue bonds as a whole, and the industrial
development sector in particular, underperformed the general municipal market.
Next to the industrial development sector, zero coupon bonds were among the
worst performing categories. The health care and housing sectors also performed
very poorly, as did lower-rated bonds backed by the 1998 master tobacco
settlement agreement.


IMPACT OF THE FUNDS' CAPITAL STRUCTURES AND LEVERAGE STRATEGIES ON PERFORMANCE

In addition to the factors mentioned above, one of the primary factors
negatively impacting the annual returns of these Funds relative to those of the
unleveraged indexes was the Funds' use of financial leverage. While leverage
offers opportunities to generate additional income and total returns for common
shareholders, the benefits provided by leveraging are influenced by the price
movements of the bonds in each Fund's portfolio. During this period, as yields
on longer-term bonds rose and their prices correspondingly fell, declining
valuations had a negative effect on performance that was magnified by the use of
leverage. In addition, at various points during the twelve-month period, the
Funds' borrowing costs were relatively high, negatively impacting their total
returns. In the turbulent market environment of the past twelve months, the
impact of any valuation change in the Fund's holdings-whether positive or
negative-was magnified by the use of leverage.


RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT

Beginning in October, the nation's financial institutions and financial
markets--including the municipal bond market--experienced significant turmoil.
Reductions in demand decreased valuations of municipal bonds across all credit
ratings, especially those with lower credit ratings, and this generally reduced
the Funds' net asset values. The municipal market is one in which dealer firms
make markets in bonds on a principal basis using their proprietary capital, and
during the recent market turmoil these firms'capital was severely constrained.
As a result, some firms were unwilling to commit their capital to purchase and
to serve as a dealer for municipal bonds. This reduction in dealer


                                       8

<PAGE>

involvement in the market was accompanied by significant net selling pressure by
investors, particularly with respect to lower-rated municipal bonds, as
institutional investors generally removed money from the municipal bond market,
at least in part because of their need to reduce the leveraging of their
municipal investments. This de-leveraging was in part driven by the overall
reduction in the amount of financing available for such leverage, the increased
costs of such leverage financing, and the need to reduce leverage levels that
had recently increased due to the decline in municipal bond prices.

Municipal bond prices were further negatively impacted by concerns that the need
for further de-leveraging and a supply overhang as a large amount of new issues
were postponed would cause selling pressure to persist for a period of time. In
addition to falling prices, these market conditions resulted in greater price
volatility of municipal bonds; wider credit spreads (i.e., lower quality bonds
fell in price more than higher quality bonds); significantly reduced liquidity
(i.e., the ability to sell bonds at a price close to their carrying value),
particularly for lower quality bonds; and a lack of price transparency (i.e.,
the ability to accurately determine the price at which a bond would likely
trade). Reduced liquidity was most pronounced in mid-October, and although
liquidity improved considerably over ensuing weeks, it may reoccur if financial
turmoil persists or worsens.


RECENT DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING BOND INSURANCE COMPANIES

As mentioned earlier, another factor that had an impact on the performance of
these Funds was their position in bonds backed by municipal bond insurers that
experienced downgrades in their credit ratings. During the period covered by
this report, ACA, AMBAC, FGIC, MBIA, RAAI and SYNCORA (formerly XLCA)
experienced one or more rating reductions by at least one or more rating
agencies. Subsequent to the reporting period, AMBAC, MBIA and SYNCORA
experienced further rating reductions while AGC and FSA received their first
rating reductions by at least one rating agency. At the time this report was
prepared, at least one rating agency has placed each of these insurers except
AGC on "negative outlook" or "negative credit watch," which may presage one or
more rating reductions for such insurer or insurers in the future. As concern
increased about the balance sheets of these insurers, prices on bonds insured by
these companies - especially those bonds with weaker underlying credits -
declined, detracting from the Funds' performance. By the end of this period,
most insured bonds were being valued according to their fundamentals as if they
were uninsured. On the whole, the holdings of all of our Funds continued to be
well diversified not only between insured and uninsured bonds, but also within
the insured bond category. It is important to note that municipal bonds
historically have had a very low rate of default.


RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SECURITIES MARKETS

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the auction rate preferred shares issued by these Funds
than


                                       9

there were offers to buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to clear" and
that many or all auction rate preferred shareholders who wanted to sell their
shares in these auctions were unable to do so. This decline in liquidity in
auction rate preferred shares did not lower the credit quality of these shares,
and auction rate preferred shareholders unable to sell their shares received
distributions at the "maximum rate'' applicable to failed auctions as calculated
in accordance with the pre-established terms of the auction rate preferred
shares.

On June 11, 2008, Nuveen announced the Fund Board's approval of plans to use
tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as floating rate securities, to refinance
a portion of the municipal Funds' outstanding auction rate preferred shares, for
which auctions have been failing for several months. This plan included an
initial phase of approximately $1 billion in forty-one Funds. During the
twelve-month reporting period, NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD and NZF redeemed $39,350,000,
$16,350,000, $18,325,000, $28,200,000 and $41,225,000 of their outstanding
auction rate preferred shares, respectively, at liquidation value, using the
proceeds from the issuance of TOBs.

On August 7, 2008, NXZ issued par redemption notices for all outstanding shares
of its auction rate preferred securities totaling $222 million. These
redemptions were achieved through the issuance of $196 million of variable rate
demand preferred shares (VRDP) and the proceeds from the creation of TOBs. VRDP
is a new instrument designed to replace the auction rate preferred securities
used as leverage in many Nuveen closed-end Funds. VRDP is offered only to
qualified institutional buyers, as defined pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act of 1933.

Common Share
Dividend and Share Price
                 INFORMATION


During the twelve-month reporting period ended October 31, 2008, there was one
dividend increase in NPP, NMA, NMO, NAD and NZF, while the dividend of NXZ
remained stable throughout the period.

Due to capital gains generated by normal portfolio activity, common shareholders
of the following Funds received capital gains or net ordinary income
distributions at the end of December 2007 as follows:

                                    Short-Term Capital Gains
          Long-Term Capital Gains     and/or Ordinary Income
                      (per share)                (per share)

NMA                       $0.0238                         --
NAD                            --                    $0.0033

All of the Funds in this report seek to pay stable dividends at rates that
reflect each Fund's past results and projected future performance. During
certain periods, each Fund may pay dividends at a rate that may be more or less
than the amount of net investment income actually earned by the Fund during the
period. If a Fund has cumulatively earned more than it has paid in dividends, it
holds the excess in reserve as undistributed net investment income (UNII) as
part of the Fund's NAV. Conversely, if a Fund has cumulatively paid dividends in
excess of its earnings, the excess constitutes negative UNII that is likewise
reflected in the Fund's NAV. Each Fund will, over time, pay all of its net
investment income as dividends to shareholders. As of October 31, 2008, NPP, NMA
and NAD had positive UNII balances for both tax and financial statement purposes
while NMO, NXZ and NZF had positive UNII balances for tax purposes and negative
UNII balances for financial statement purposes.

The Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees approved an open-market share repurchase
program on July 30, 2008, under which each Fund may repurchase up to 10% of its
common shares. As of October 31, 2008, the Funds had not repurchased any of
their outstanding common shares.

As of October 31, 2008, the Funds' common share prices were trading at discounts
to their common share NAVs as shown in the accompanying chart:

(1)  The percentages shown in the foregoing chart may reflect the ratings on
     certain bonds insured by ACA, AGC, AMBAC, FGIC, FSA, MBIA, RAAI and SYNCORA
     as of October 31, 2008. Please see the Portfolio Managers' Commentary for
     an expanded discussion of the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings
     of certain bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings of
     the underlying insurers both during the period and after period end.

(2)  Taxable-Equivalent Yield represents the yield that must be earned on a
     fully taxable investment in order to equal the yield of the Fund on an
     after-tax basis. It is based on a federal income tax rate of 28%. When
     comparing this Fund to investments that generate qualified dividend income,
     the Taxable-Equivalent Yield is lower.

NUVEEN DIVIDEND ADVANTAGE MUNICIPAL FUND 2

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the portfolios of investments, of Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc.,
Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund 2, and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3 (the "Funds")
as of October 31, 2008, and the related statements of operations and cash flows
(Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 only) for the year then ended, the
statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then
ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period
then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Funds' management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were
not engaged to perform an audit of the Funds' internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Funds' internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of
securities owned as of October 31, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian
and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from
brokers were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial positions of
Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc., Nuveen Municipal Advantage Fund,
Inc., Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund, Inc., Nuveen Dividend Advantage
Municipal Fund, Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2, and Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund 3 at October 31, 2008, the results of their operations
and cash flows (Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 2 only) for the year
then ended, changes in their net assets for each of the two years in the period
then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in the
period then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

                                                           /s/ Ernst & Young LLP

               (1)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are
                    based on net assets applicable to Common shares unless
                    otherwise noted.

               (2)  Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of
                    independent registered public accounting firm): Dates (month
                    and year) and prices of the earliest optional call or
                    redemption. There may be other call provisions at varying
                    prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities
                    may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

                    Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
                    Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
                    below investment grade.

                    The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on
                    certain bonds insured by ACA, AGC, AMBAC, FGIC, FSA, MBIA,
                    RAAI and SYNCORA as of October 31, 2008. Please see the
                    Portfolio Managers' Commentary for an expanded discussion of
                    the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
                    bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings
                    of the underlying insurers both during the period and after
                    period end.

               (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
                    Government or U.S. Government agency securities which ensure
                    the timely payment of principal and interest. Such
                    investments are normally considered to be equivalent to AAA
                    rated securities.

               (5)  Auction Rate Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a
                    percentage of Total Investments is 35.9%.

                    redemption. There may be other call provisions at varying
                    prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities

                    Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
                    below investment grade.

                    The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on
                    certain bonds insured by ACA, AGC, AMBAC, FGIC, FSA, MBIA

                    Managers' Commentary for an expanded discussion of the
                    affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
                    bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings
                    of the underlying insurers both during the period and after

                    the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
                    bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings

</TABLE>
               (1)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are
                    based on net assets applicable to Common shares unless
                    otherwise noted.

               (2)  Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of
                    independent registered public accounting firm): Dates (month
                    and year) and prices of the earliest optional call or
                    redemption. There may be other call provisions at varying
                    prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities
                    may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

               (3)  Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered
                    public accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard &
                    Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's") or Moody's Investor
                    Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
                    Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
                    below investment grade.

                    The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on
                    certain bonds insured by ACA, AGC, AMBAC, FGIC, FSA, MBIA,
                    RAAI and SYNCORA as of October 31, 2008. Please see the
                    Portfolio Managers' Commentary for an expanded discussion of
                    the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
                    bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings
                    of the underlying insurers both during the period and after
                    period end.

               (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
                    Government or U.S. Government agency securities which ensure
                    the timely payment of principal and interest. Such
                    investments are normally considered to be equivalent to AAA
                    rated securities.

               (5)  Non-income producing security, in the case of a bond,
                    generally denotes that the issuer has defaulted on the
                    payment of principal or interest or has filed for
                    bankruptcy.

               (6)  Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has
                    variable rate and demand features which qualify it as a
                    short-term investment. The rate disclosed is that in effect
                    at the end of the reporting period. This rate changes
                    periodically based on market conditions or a specified
                    market index.

               (7)  Auction Rate Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value as a
                    percentage of Total Investments is 35.0%.

               N/R  Not rated.

              (IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

              (UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected
                    as a financing transaction pursuant to the provisions of
                    SFAS No. 140.

                                 See accompanying notes to financial statements.

               (1)  All percentages shown in the Portfolio of Investments are
                    based on net assets applicable to Common shares unless
                    otherwise noted.

               (2)  Optional Call Provisions (not covered by the report of
                    independent registered public accounting firm): Dates (month
                    and year) and prices of the earliest optional call or
                    redemption. There may be other call provisions at varying
                    prices at later dates. Certain mortgage-backed securities
                    may be subject to periodic principal paydowns.

               (3)  Ratings (not covered by the report of independent registered
                    public accounting firm): Using the higher of Standard &
                    Poor's Group ("Standard & Poor's") or Moody's Investor
                    Service, Inc. ("Moody's") rating. Ratings below BBB by
                    Standard & Poor's or Baa by Moody's are considered to be
                    below investment grade.

                    The Portfolio of Investments may reflect the ratings on
                    certain bonds insured by ACA, AGC, AMBAC, FGIC, FSA, MBIA,
                    RAAI and SYNCORA as of October 31, 2008. Please see the
                    Portfolio Managers' Commentary for an expanded discussion of
                    the affect on the Fund of changes to the ratings of certain
                    bonds in the portfolio resulting from changes to the ratings
                    of the underlying insurers both during the period and after
                    period end.

               (4)  Backed by an escrow or trust containing sufficient U.S.
                    Government or U.S. Government agency securities which ensure
                    the timely payment of principal and interest. Such
                    investments are normally considered to be equivalent to AAA
                    rated securities.

               (5)  Portion of investment has been pledged as collateral for
                    Recourse Trusts.

               (6)  Investment has a maturity of more than one year, but has
                    variable rate and demand features which qualify it as a
                    short-term investment. The rate disclosed is that in effect
                    at the end of the reporting period. This rate changes
                    periodically based on market conditions or a specified
                    market index.

               (7)  Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares, at Liquidation Value
                    as a percentage of Total Investments is 34.6%.

               N/R  Not rated.

              (IF)  Inverse floating rate investment.

              (UB)  Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust reflected
                    as a financing transaction pursuant to the provisions of
                    SFAS No. 140.

1. GENERAL INFORMATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The funds covered in this report and their corresponding Common share stock
exchange symbols are Nuveen Performance Plus Municipal Fund, Inc. (NPP), Nuveen
Municipal Advantage Fund, Inc. (NMA), Nuveen Municipal Market Opportunity Fund,
Inc. (NMO), Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund (NAD), Nuveen Dividend
Advantage Municipal Fund 2 (NXZ) and Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3
(NZF) (collectively, the "Funds"). Performance Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage
(NMA), Market Opportunity (NMO) and Dividend Advantage (NAD) are traded on the
New York Stock Exchange while Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) and Dividend Advantage
3 (NZF) are traded on the American Stock Exchange. The Funds are registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as closed-end, diversified
management investment companies.

Each Fund seeks to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax
by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of municipal obligations
issued by state and local government authorities or certain U.S. territories.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Funds in the preparation of their financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Investment Valuation

The prices of municipal bonds in each Fund's investment portfolio are provided
by a pricing service approved by the Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. When
market price quotes are not readily available (which is usually the case for
municipal securities), the pricing service may establish fair value based on
yields or prices of municipal bonds of comparable quality, type of issue,
coupon, maturity and rating, indications of value from securities dealers,
evaluations of anticipated cash flows or collateral and general market
conditions. Prices of forward swap contracts are also provided by an independent
pricing service approved by each Fund's Board of Directors/Trustees. Futures
contracts are valued using the closing settlement price, or, in the absence of
such a price, at the mean of the bid and asked prices. If the pricing service is
unable to supply a price for an investment or derivative instrument, each Fund
may use market quotes provided by major broker/dealers in such investments. If
it is determined that the market price for an investment or derivative
instrument is unavailable or inappropriate, the Board of Directors/Trustees of
the Funds, or its designee, may establish fair value in accordance with
procedures established in good faith by the Board of Directors/Trustees.
Temporary investments in securities that have variable rate and demand features
qualifying them as short-term investments are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates market value.

Investment Transactions

Investment transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and
losses from transactions are determined on the specific identification method.
Investments purchased on a when-issued/delayed delivery basis may have extended
settlement periods. Any investments so purchased are subject to market
fluctuation during this period. The Funds have instructed the custodian to
segregate assets with a current value at least equal to the amount of the
when-issued/delayed delivery purchase commitments. At October 31, 2008, there
were no such outstanding purchase commitments in any of the Funds.

Investment Income

Interest income, which includes the amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts for financial reporting purposes, is recorded on an accrual basis.
Interest income also includes paydown gains and losses, if any. Dividend income,
if any, is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

Income Taxes

Each Fund is a separate taxpayer for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund
intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net
capital gains to shareholders and to otherwise comply with the requirements of
Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment
companies. Therefore, no federal income tax provision is required. Furthermore,
each Fund intends to satisfy conditions which will enable interest from
municipal securities, which is exempt from


                                       95

Notes to
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)



regular federal income tax, to retain such tax-exempt status when distributed to
shareholders of the Funds. Net realized capital gains and ordinary income
distributions paid by the Funds are subject to federal taxation.

Effective April 30, 2008, the Funds adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN
48). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be
recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN
48 requires the affirmative evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in the course of preparing the Funds' tax returns to determine whether it
is "more-likely-than-not" (i.e., a greater than 50-percent likelihood) of being
sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the
more-likely-than-not threshold may result in a tax expense in the current year.

Implementation of FIN 48 required management of the Funds to analyze all open
tax years, as defined by the statute of limitations, for all major
jurisdictions, which includes federal and certain states. Open tax years are
those that are open for examination by taxing authorities (i.e., generally the
last four tax year ends and the interim tax period since then). The Funds have
no examinations in progress.

For all open tax years and all major taxing jurisdictions through the end of the
reporting period, management of the Funds has reviewed all tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in the preparation of the Funds' tax returns and
concluded the adoption of FIN 48 resulted in no impact to the Funds' net assets
or results of operations as of and during the fiscal year ended October 31,
2008.

The Funds are also not aware of any tax positions for which it is reasonably
possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly
change in the next twelve months.

Dividends and Distributions to Common Shareholders

Dividends from tax-exempt net investment income are declared monthly. Net
realized capital gains and/or market discount from investment transactions, if
any, are distributed to shareholders at least annually. Furthermore, capital
gains are distributed only to the extent they exceed available capital loss
carryforwards.

Distributions to Common shareholders of tax-exempt net investment income, net
realized capital gains and/or market discount, if any, are recorded on the
ex-dividend date. The amount and timing of distributions are determined in
accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Auction Rate Preferred Shares

The following Funds have issued and outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares,
$25,000 stated value per share, as a means of effecting financial leverage. Each
Fund's Auction Rate Preferred shares are issued in more than one series. The
dividend rate paid by the Funds on each Series is determined every seven days,
pursuant to a dutch auction process overseen by the auction agent, and is
payable at the end of each rate period. As of October 31, 2008, the number of
Auction Rate Preferred shares outstanding, by Series and in total, for each Fund
is as follows:

Beginning in February 2008, more shares for sale were submitted in the regularly
scheduled auctions for the Auction Rate Preferred shares issued by the Funds
than there were offers to buy. This meant that these auctions "failed to
clear," and that many Auction Rate Preferred shareholders who wanted to sell
their shares in these auctions were unable to do so. Auction Rate Preferred
shareholders unable to sell their shares received distributions at the "maximum
rate" applicable to failed auctions as calculated in accordance with the
pre-established terms of the Auction Rate Preferred shares.

These developments generally do not affect the management or investment policies
of the Funds. However, one implication of these auction failures for Common
shareholders is that the Funds' cost of leverage will be higher, at least
temporarily, than it otherwise would have been had the auctions continued to be
successful. As a result, the Funds' future Common share earnings may be lower
than they otherwise would have been.

On June 11, 2008, Nuveen Investments, Inc. ("Nuveen") announced the Fund Board's
approval of plans to use tender option bonds (TOBs), also known as "floaters" or
floating rate obligations, to refinance a portion of the municipal funds'
outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares, whose auctions have been failing for
several months. The plan included an initial phase of approximately $1 billion
in forty-one funds. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008 Performance
Plus (NPP), Municipal Advantage (NMA), Market Opportunity (NMO), Dividend
Advantage (NAD) and Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF) redeemed $39,350,000,
$16,350,000, $18,325,000, $28,200,000 and $41,225,000 of their outstanding
Auction Rate Preferred shares, respectively, at liquidation value, using the
proceeds from the issuance of TOBs.

Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares

On August 7, 2008, Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) issued 1,960 Series 1 Variable
Rate Demand Preferred (VRDP) shares, $100,000 liquidation value per share,
through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act of 1933. Proceeds of this offering along with the
proceeds from the Fund's creation of TOBs, discussed above, were used to redeem
all of the Fund's outstanding Auction Rate Preferred shares totaling
$222,000,000. The VRDP shares have a maturity date of August 1, 2038. Dividends
on the VRDP shares are set through a weekly remarketing process at a rate
established by a remarketing agent, which is intended to result in the value of
the VRDP shares approximately equaling their liquidation value. VRDP shares
include a liquidity feature that allows VRDP shareholders who are tendering
shares for remarketing to have their shares purchased by a liquidity provider,
Deutsche Bank AG (acting through its New York branch), in the event that the
remarketing agent is not able to sell the tendered VRDP shares to other
qualified institutional buyers.

Subject to certain conditions, VRDP shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part,
at any time at the option of the Fund. The Fund may also redeem certain of the
VRDP shares if the Fund fails to maintain certain asset coverage requirements
and such failures are not cured by the applicable cure date. The redemption
price per share is equal to the sum of the liquidation value per share plus any
accumulated but unpaid dividends.

The terms of the VRDP shares provide that, if any VRDP shares tendered to the
liquidity provider cannot be successfully remarketed, the dividend rate for all
VRDP shares will be set at the Maximum Rate determined under a formula set forth
in the Fund's organizational documents. The Maximum Rate is generally equal to a
stated percentage spread in excess of the seven-day London Inter-Bank Offered
Rate (LIBOR). If remarketings for these shares continue to be unsuccessful, the
Maximum Rate is designed to escalate according to a specified schedule in order
to enhance the remarketing agent's ability to successfully remarket the VRDP
shares. This would increase the Fund's cost of leverage over time and reduce the
Fund's Common share net earnings. There are various potential factors that could
result in unsuccessful remarketings. These include periods of market stress, an
actual or potential downgrade of the liquidity provider's credit ratings as well
as changes in market perceptions regarding the financial strength of the Fund's
liquidity provider.

Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) had $196,000,000 VRDP shares outstanding for the
period August 7, 2008 through October 31, 2008 with an annualized interest rate
of 3.56%.

For financial reporting purposes only, VRDP shares, at the liquidation value,
are recorded as a liability on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities and the
dividends paid on the VRDP shares are included as a component of "Interest
expense" on the Statement of Operations.

Inverse Floating Rate Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in inverse floating rate securities. An
inverse floating rate security is created by depositing a municipal bond,
typically with a fixed interest rate, into a special purpose trust created by a
broker-dealer. In turn, this trust (a) issues floating rate certificates, in
face amounts equal to some fraction of the deposited bond's par amount or market
value, that typically pay short-term tax-exempt interest rates to third parties,
and (b) issues to a long-term investor (such as one of the Funds) an inverse
floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater") that
represents all remaining or residual interest in the trust. The income received
by the inverse floater holder varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to
the floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the inverse
floater holder bears substantially all of the underlying bond's downside
investment risk and also benefits disproportionately from any potential
appreciation of the underlying bond's value. The price of an inverse floating
rate security will be more volatile than that of the underlying bond because the
interest rate is dependent on not


                                       97

                      Notes to
                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)



only the fixed coupon rate of the underlying bond but also on the short-term
interest paid on the floating rate certificates, and because the inverse
floating rate security essentially bears the risk of loss of the greater face
value of the underlying bond.

A Fund may purchase an inverse floating rate security in a secondary market
transaction without first owning the underlying bond (referred to as an
"externally-deposited inverse floater"), or instead by first selling a
fixed-rate bond to a broker-dealer for deposit into the special purpose trust
and receiving in turn the residual interest in the trust (referred to as a
"self-deposited inverse floater"). The inverse floater held by a Fund gives the
Fund the right (a) to cause the holders of the floating rate certificates to
tender their notes at par, and (b) to have the broker transfer the fixed-rate
bond held by the trust to the Fund, thereby collapsing the trust. An investment
in an externally-deposited inverse floater is identified in the Portfolio of
Investments as an "Inverse floating rate investment". An investment in a
self-deposited inverse floater is accounted for as a financing transaction in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (SFAS No.
140) "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishment of Liabilities". In such instances, a fixed-rate bond deposited
into a special purpose trust is identified in the Portfolio of Investments as an
"Underlying bond of an inverse floating rate trust", with the Fund accounting
for the short-term floating rate certificates issued by the trust as "Floating
rate obligations" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. In addition, the
Fund reflects in Investment Income the entire earnings of the underlying bond
and the related interest paid to the holders of the short-term floating rate
certificates is included as a component of "Interest expense" on the Statement
of Operations.

Each Fund may also enter into shortfall and forbearance agreements (sometimes
referred to as a "recourse trust" or "credit recovery swap") (such agreements
referred to herein as "Recourse Trusts") with a broker-dealer by which a Fund
agrees to reimburse the broker-dealer, in certain circumstances, for the
difference between the liquidation value of the fixed-rate bond held by the
trust and the liquidation value of the floating rate certificates issued by the
trust plus any shortfalls in interest cash flows. Under these agreements, a
Fund's potential exposure to losses related to or on inverse floaters may
increase beyond the value of a Fund's inverse floater investments as a Fund may
potentially be liable to fulfill all amounts owed to holders of the floating
rate certificates. At period end, any such shortfall is included as "Unrealized
depreciation on Recourse Trusts" on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008, each Fund invested in externally
deposited inverse floaters and/or self-deposited inverse floaters.

At October 31, 2008, each Fund's maximum exposure to externally-deposited
Recourse Trusts, if any, is as follows:

Forward Swap Transactions

Each Fund is authorized to invest in forward interest rate swap transactions.
Each Fund's use of forward interest rate swap transactions is intended to help
the Fund manage its overall interest rate sensitivity, either shorter or longer,
generally to more closely align the Fund's interest rate sensitivity with that
of the broader municipal market. Forward interest rate swap transactions


                                       98

<PAGE>

involve each Fund's agreement with a counterparty to pay, in the future, a fixed
or variable rate payment in exchange for the counterparty paying the Fund a
variable or fixed rate payment, the accruals for which would begin at a
specified date in the future (the "effective date"). The amount of the payment
obligation is based on the notional amount of the forward swap contract and the
termination date of the swap (which is akin to a bond's maturity). The value of
the Fund's swap commitment would increase or decrease based primarily on the
extent to which long-term interest rates for bonds having a maturity of the
swap's termination date increases or decreases. The Funds may terminate a swap
contract prior to the effective date, at which point a realized gain or loss is
recognized. When a forward swap is terminated, it ordinarily does not involve
the delivery of securities or other underlying assets or principal, but rather
is settled in cash on a net basis. Each Fund intends, but is not obligated, to
terminate its forward swaps before the effective date. Accordingly, the risk of
loss with respect to the swap counterparty on such transactions is limited to
the credit risk associated with a counterparty failing to honor its commitment
to pay any realized gain to the Fund upon termination. To reduce such credit
risk, all counterparties are required to pledge collateral daily (based on the
daily valuation of each swap) on behalf of each Fund with a value approximately
equal to the amount of any unrealized gain above a pre-determined threshold.
Reciprocally, when any of the Funds have an unrealized loss on a swap contract,
the Funds have instructed the custodian to pledge assets of the Funds as
collateral with a value approximately equal to the amount of the unrealized loss
above a pre-determined threshold. Collateral pledges are monitored and
subsequently adjusted if and when the swap valuations fluctuate, either up or
down, by at least the predetermined threshold amount. Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF)
was the only Fund to invest in forward interest swap transactions during the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2008.

Futures Contracts

Each Fund is authorized to invest in futures contracts. Upon entering into a
futures contract, a Fund is required to deposit with the broker an amount of
cash or liquid securities equal to a specified percentage of the contract
amount. This is known as the "initial margin." Subsequent payments ("variation
margin") are made or received by a Fund each day, depending on the daily
fluctuation of the value of the contract.

During the period the futures contract is open, changes in the value of the
contract are recognized as an unrealized gain or loss by "marking-to-market" on
a daily basis to reflect the changes in market value of the contract. When the
contract is closed or expired, a Fund records a realized gain or loss equal to
the difference between the value of the contract on the closing date and value
of the contract when originally entered into. Cash held by the broker to cover
initial margin requirements on open futures contracts, if any, is recognized on
the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Additionally, the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities reflects a receivable or payable for the variation margin, when
applicable. Dividend Advantage 3 (NZF) was the only Fund to invest in futures
contracts during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008.

Risks of investments in futures contracts include the possible adverse movement
of the securities or indices underlying the contracts, the possibility that
there may not be a liquid secondary market for the contracts and/or that a
change in the value of the contract may not correlate with a change in the value
of the underlying securities or indices.

Zero Coupon Securities

Each Fund is authorized to invest in zero coupon securities. A zero coupon
security does not pay a regular interest coupon to its holders during the life
of the security. Tax-exempt income to the holder of the security comes from
accretion of the difference between the original purchase price of the security
at issuance and the par value of the security at maturity and is effectively
paid at maturity. Such securities are included in the Portfolios of Investments
with a 0.000% coupon rate in their description. The market prices of zero coupon
securities generally are more volatile than the market prices of securities that
pay interest periodically.

Offering Costs

Costs incurred by Dividend Advantage 2 (NXZ) in connection with its offering of
the VRDP shares ($2,270,000) were recorded as a deferred charge which will be
amortized over the 30-year life of the shares and is included as a component of
"Interest expense"on the Statement of Operations.

Custodian Fee Credit

Each Fund has an arrangement with the custodian bank whereby certain custodian
fees and expenses are reduced by net credits earned on each Fund's cash on
deposit with the bank. Such deposit arrangements are an alternative to overnight
investments. Credits for cash balances may be offset by charges for any days on
which a Fund overdraws its account at the custodian bank.

Indemnifications

Under the Funds' organizational documents, their Officers and Director/Trustees
are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of
their duties to the Funds. In addition, in the normal course of business, the
Funds enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications to other
parties. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this
would involve future claims that may be made against the Funds that have not yet
occurred. However, the Funds have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to
these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.

                      FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)



Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and
decreases in net assets applicable to Common shares from operations during the
reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

2. FUND SHARES

Common Shares

On July 30, 2008, the Funds' Board of Directors/Trustees approved an open-market
share repurchase program under which each Fund may repurchase an aggregate of up
to approximately 10% of its outstanding Common shares. The Funds did not
repurchase any of their Common shares during the fiscal year ended October 31,
2008.

4. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

The following information is presented on an income tax basis. Differences
between amounts for financial statement and federal income tax purposes are
primarily due to timing differences in recognizing taxable market discount,
timing differences in recognizing certain gains and losses on investment
transactions and the treatment of investments in inverse floating rate
transactions subject to SFAS No. 140. To the extent that differences arise that
are permanent in nature, such amounts are reclassified within the capital
accounts on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities presented in the annual
report, based on their federal tax basis treatment; temporary differences do not
require reclassification. Temporary and permanent differences do not impact the
net asset values of the Funds.

At October 31, 2008, the cost of investments was as follows:

5. MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

Each Fund's management fee is separated into two components - a complex-level
component, based on the aggregate amount of all fund assets managed by Nuveen
Asset Management (the "Adviser"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Nuveen, and a
specific fund-level component, based only on the amount of assets within each
individual Fund. This pricing structure enables Nuveen fund shareholders to
benefit from growth in the assets within each individual fund as well as from
growth in the amount of complex-wide assets managed by the Adviser.

The annual fund-level fee, payable monthly, for each Fund is based upon the
average daily net assets (including net assets attributable to Auction Rate
Preferred shares or VRDP shares) of each Fund as follows:

                                                          PERFORMANCE PLUS (NPP)
AVERAGE DAILY NET ASSETS (INCLUDING                    MUNICIPAL ADVANTAGE (NMA)
NET ASSETS ATTRIBUTABLE TO                              MARKET OPPORTUNITY (NMO)
AUCTION RATE PREFERRED SHARES OR VRDP SHARES)                FUND-LEVEL FEE RATE

(1)  The complex-level component of the management fee for the funds is
     calculated based upon the aggregate daily net assets of all Nuveen funds,
     with such daily net assets to include assets attributable to preferred
     stock (Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares) issued by or
     borrowings by such funds) but to exclude assets attributable to investments
     in other Nuveen funds.

The management fee compensates the Adviser for overall investment advisory and
administrative services and general office facilities. The Funds pay no
compensation directly to those of its Directors/Trustees who are affiliated with
the Adviser or to its Officers, all of whom receive remuneration for their
services to the Funds from the Adviser or its affiliates. The Board of
Directors/Trustees has adopted a deferred compensation plan for independent
Directors/Trustees that enables Directors/Trustees to elect to defer receipt of
all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from
certain Nuveen advised funds. Under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as
though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of select Nuveen advised
funds.

For the first ten years of Dividend Advantage's (NAD) operations, the Adviser
has agreed to reimburse the Fund, as a percentage of average daily net assets
(including net assets attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP
shares), for fees and expenses in the amounts and for the time periods set forth
below:

6. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157 (SFASNo. 157)

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements." This
standard establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a
framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about
fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 applies to fair value measurements already
required or permitted by existing standards. SFAS No. 157 is effective for
financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The changes to current generally
accepted accounting principles from the application of this standard relate to
the definition of fair value, the methods used to measure fair value, and the
expanded disclosures about fair value measurements. As of October 31, 2008,
management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will impact the
financial statement amounts; however, additional disclosures may be required
about the inputs used to develop the measurements and the effect of certain of
the measurements included within the Statement of Operations for the period.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 161 (SFASNo. 161)

In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, "Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This standard is intended to enhance
financial statement disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and enable investors to understand: a) how and why a fund uses
derivative instruments, b) how derivative instruments and related hedge items
are accounted for, and c) how derivative instruments and related hedge items
affect a fund's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. SFAS
No. 161 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and
interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. As of October 31, 2008,
management does not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 161 will impact the
financial statement amounts; however, additional footnote disclosures may be
required about the use of derivative instruments and hedging items.

*    Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
     market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
     reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
     per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
     period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
     month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
     reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
     over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
     price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
     used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

     Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
     changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
     asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
     if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
     on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
     reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for the
     last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
     market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
     from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**   After custodian fee credit, expense reimbursement and legal fee refund,
     where applicable.

+    The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++   Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
     Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
     attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares, where
     applicable.

(a)  Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
     shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
     floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully described
     in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating
     Rate Securities, where applicable.

*    Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
     market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
     reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
     per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
     period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
     month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
     reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
     over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
     price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
     used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

     Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
     changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
     asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
     if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
     on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
     reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for the
     last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
     market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
     from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**   After custodian fee credit, expense reimbursement and legal fee refund,
     where applicable.

+    The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++   Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
     Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
     attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares, where
     applicable.

(a)  Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
     shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
     floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully described
     in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating
     Rate Securities, where applicable.

*    Total Return Based on Market Value is the combination of changes in the
     market price per share and the effect of reinvested dividend income and
     reinvested capital gains distributions, if any, at the average price paid
     per share at the time of reinvestment. The last dividend declared in the
     period, which is typically paid on the first business day of the following
     month, is assumed to be reinvested at the ending market price. The actual
     reinvestment for the last dividend declared in the period may take place
     over several days, and in some instances may not be based on the market
     price, so the actual reinvestment price may be different from the price
     used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

     Total Return Based on Common Share Net Asset Value is the combination of
     changes in Common share net asset value, reinvested dividend income at net
     asset value and reinvested capital gains distributions at net asset value,
     if any. The last dividend declared in the period, which is typically paid
     on the first business day of the following month, is assumed to be
     reinvested at the ending net asset value. The actual reinvest price for the
     last dividend declared in the period may often be based on the Fund's
     market price (and not its net asset value), and therefore may be different
     from the price used in the calculation. Total returns are not annualized.

**   After custodian fee credit, expense reimbursement and legal fee refund,
     where applicable.

+    The amounts shown are based on Common share equivalents.

++   Ratios do not reflect the effect of dividend payments to Auction Rate
     Preferred shareholders; income ratios reflect income earned on assets
     attributable to Auction Rate Preferred shares or VRDP shares, where
     applicable.

(a)  Interest expense arises from payments to Variable Rate Demand Preferred
     shareholders and the application of SFAS No. 140 to certain inverse
     floating rate transactions entered into by the Fund as more fully described
     in Footnote 1 - Variable Rate Demand Preferred Shares and Inverse Floating
     Rate Securities, where applicable.

Annual Investment
Management Agreement
        APPROVAL PROCESS


The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), provides, in
substance, that each investment advisory agreement between a fund and its
investment adviser will continue in effect from year to year only if its
continuance is approved at least annually by the fund's board members, including
by a vote of a majority of the board members who are not parties to the advisory
agreement or "interested persons" of any parties (the "Independent Board
Members"), cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of considering
such approval. In connection with such approvals, the fund's board members must
request and evaluate, and the investment adviser is required to furnish, such
information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the advisory
agreement. Accordingly, at a meeting held on May 28-29, 2008 (the "May
Meeting"), the Boards of Trustees or Directors (as the case may be)(each, a
"Board" and each Trustee or Director, a "Board Member") of the Funds, including
a majority of the Independent Board Members, considered and approved the
continuation of the advisory agreement (each, an "Advisory Agreement") between
each Fund and Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM") for an additional one-year period.
In preparation for their considerations at the May Meeting, the Board also held
a separate meeting on April 23, 2008 (the "April Meeting"). Accordingly, the
factors considered and determinations made regarding the renewals by the
Independent Board Members include those made at the April Meeting.

In addition, in evaluating the Advisory Agreements, as described in further
detail below, the Independent Board Members reviewed a broad range of
information relating to the Funds and NAM, including absolute performance, fee
and expense information for the Funds as well as comparative performance, fee
and expense information for a comparable peer group of funds, the performance
information of recognized benchmarks (as applicable), the profitability of
Nuveen for its advisory activities (which includes its wholly owned
subsidiaries), and other information regarding the organization, personnel, and
services provided by NAM. The Independent Board Members also met quarterly as
well as at other times as the need arose during the year and took into account
the information provided at such meetings and the knowledge gained therefrom.
Prior to approving the renewal of the Advisory Agreements, the Independent Board
Members reviewed the foregoing information with their independent legal counsel
and with management, reviewed materials from independent legal counsel
describing applicable law and their duties in reviewing advisory contracts, and
met with independent legal counsel in private sessions without management
present. The Independent Board Members considered the legal advice provided by
independent legal counsel and relied upon their knowledge of NAM, its services
and the Funds resulting from their meetings and other interactions throughout
the year and their own business judgment in determining the factors to be
considered in evaluating the Advisory Agreements. Each Board Member may have
accorded different weight to the various factors in reaching his or her
conclusions with respect to a Fund's Advisory Agreement. The Independent Board
Members did not identify any single factor as all-important or controlling. The
Independent Board Members' considerations were instead based on a comprehensive
consideration of all the information presented. The principal factors considered
by the Board and its conclusions are described below.

A.   NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

In considering renewal of the Advisory Agreements, the Independent Board Members
considered the nature, extent and quality of NAM's services, including advisory
services and administrative services. The Independent Board Members reviewed
materials outlining, among other things, NAM's organization and business; the
types of services that NAM or its affiliates provide and are expected to provide
to the Funds; the performance record of the applicable Fund (as described in
further detail below); and any initiatives Nuveen had taken for the applicable
fund product line. With respect to personnel, the Independent Board Members
evaluated the background, experience and track record of NAM's


                                      118

<PAGE>


investment personnel. In this regard, the Independent Board Members considered
the additional investment in personnel to support Nuveen fund advisory
activities, including in operations, product management and marketing as well as
related fund support functions, including sales, executive, finance, human
resources and information technology. The Independent Board Members also
reviewed information regarding portfolio manager compensation arrangements to
evaluate NAM's ability to attract and retain high quality investment personnel.

In evaluating the services of NAM, the Independent Board Members also considered
NAM's ability to supervise the Funds' other service providers and given the
importance of compliance, NAM's compliance program. Among other things, the
Independent Board Members considered the report of the chief compliance officer
regarding the Funds' compliance policies and procedures.

In addition to advisory services, the Independent Board Members considered the
quality of administrative services provided by NAM and its affiliates including
product management, fund administration, oversight of service providers,
shareholder services, administration of Board relations, regulatory and
portfolio compliance and legal support.

In addition to the foregoing services, the Independent Board Members also noted
the additional services that NAM or its affiliates provide to closed-end funds,
including, in particular, its secondary market support activities and the costs
of such activities. The Independent Board Members recognized Nuveen's continued
commitment to supporting the secondary market for the common shares of its
closed-end funds through a variety of programs designed to raise investor and
analyst awareness and understanding of closed-end funds. These efforts include
maintaining an investor relations program to timely provide information and
education to financial advisers and investors; providing advertising and
marketing for the closed-end funds; maintaining its closed-end fund website; and
providing educational seminars. With respect to closed-end funds that utilize
leverage through the issuance of auction rate preferred securities ("ARPS"), the
Board has recognized the unprecedented market conditions in the auction rate
market industry with the failure of the auction process. The Independent Board
Members noted Nuveen's efforts and the resources and personnel employed to
analyze the situation, explore potential alternatives and develop and implement
solutions that serve the interests of the affected funds and all of their
respective shareholders. The Independent Board Members further noted Nuveen's
commitment and efforts to keep investors and financial advisers informed as to
its progress in addressing the ARPS situation through, among other things,
conference calls, press releases, and information posted on its website as well
as its refinancing activities. The Independent Board Members also noted Nuveen's
continued support for holders of preferred shares of its closed-end funds by,
among other things, seeking distribution for preferred shares with new market
participants, managing relations with remarketing agents and the broker
community, maintaining the leverage and risk management of leverage and
maintaining systems necessary to test compliance with rating agency criteria.

Based on their review, the Independent Board Members found that, overall, the
nature, extent and quality of services provided (and expected to be provided) to
the respective Funds under the Advisory Agreements were satisfactory.

B.   THE INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE OF THE FUNDS AND NAM

The Board considered the investment performance of each Fund, including the
Fund's historic performance as well as its performance compared to funds with
similar investment objectives (the "Performance Peer Group") based on data
provided by an independent third party (as described below). The Independent
Board Members also reviewed portfolio level performance (which does not reflect
fund level fees, expenses and leverage), as described in further detail below.

In evaluating the performance information, the Board considered whether the Fund
has operated within its investment objectives and parameters and the impact that
the investment mandates may have had on performance. In addition, in comparing a
Fund's performance with that of its Performance Peer Group, the Independent
Board Members took into account that the closest Performance Peer Group in
certain


                                      119

<PAGE>

ANNUAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
APPROVAL PROCESS (continued)


instances may not adequately reflect the respective fund's investment objectives
and strategies thereby hindering a meaningful comparison of the fund's
performance with that of the Performance Peer Group.

The Independent Board Members reviewed performance information including, among
other things, total return information compared with the Fund's Performance Peer
Group and recognized benchmarks for the one-, three-, and five-year periods (as
applicable) ending December 31, 2007 and with the Performance Peer Group for the
quarter and same yearly periods ending March 31, 2008 (as applicable). The
Independent Board Members also reviewed the Fund's portfolio level performance
(which does not reflect fund level fees and expenses (and leverage for
closed-end funds)) compared to recognized benchmarks for the one-, three-, and
five-year periods ending December 31, 2007 (as applicable). The analysis was
used to assess the efficacy of investment decisions against appropriate measures
of risk and total return, within specific market segments. This information
supplemented the Fund performance information provided to the Board at each of
its quarterly meetings. Based on their review, the Independent Board Members
determined that each Fund's investment performance over time had been
satisfactory.

C.   FEES, EXPENSES AND PROFITABILITY

     1.   FEES AND EXPENSES

     The Board evaluated the management fees and expenses of each Fund
     reviewing, among other things, such Fund's gross management fees (which
     take into account breakpoints), net management fees (which take into
     account fee waivers or reimbursements) and total expense ratios (before and
     after expense reimbursements and/or waivers) in absolute terms as well as
     compared to the gross management fees, net management fees (after waivers
     and/or reimbursements) and total expense ratios (before and after waivers)
     of a comparable universe of unaffiliated funds based on data provided by an
     independent data provider (the "Peer Universe") and/or a more focused
     subset of funds therein (the "Peer Group"). The Independent Board Members
     further reviewed data regarding the construction of Peer Groups as well as
     the methods of measurement for the fee and expense analysis and the
     performance analysis. In reviewing the comparisons of fee and expense
     information, the Independent Board Members took into account that in
     certain instances various factors such as the size of the Fund relative to
     peers, the size and particular composition of the Peer Group, the
     investment objectives of the peers, expense anomalies, and the timing of
     information used may impact the comparative data, thereby limiting the
     ability to make a meaningful comparison. The Independent Board Members also
     considered, among other things, the differences in the use of leverage and
     the differences in the use of insurance, if any. In reviewing the fee
     schedule for a Fund, the Independent Board Members also considered the
     fund-level and complex-wide breakpoint schedules (described in further
     detail below) and any fee waivers and reimbursements provided by Nuveen
     (applicable, in particular, for certain closed-end funds launched since
     1999). Based on their review of the fee and expense information provided,
     the Independent Board Members determined that each Fund's management fees
     and net total expense ratio were reasonable in light of the nature, extent
     and quality of services provided to the Fund.

     2.   COMPARISONS WITH THE FEES OF OTHER CLIENTS

     The Independent Board Members further reviewed information regarding the
     nature of services and fee rates offered by NAM to other clients. Such
     other clients include NAM's municipal separately managed accounts. In
     evaluating the comparisons of fees, the Independent Board Members noted
     that the fee rates charged to the Funds and other clients vary, among other
     things, because of the different services involved and the additional
     regulatory and compliance requirements associated with registered
     investment companies, such as the Funds. Accordingly, the Independent Board
     Members considered the differences in the product types, including, but not
     limited to, the services provided, the structure and operations, product
     distribution and costs thereof, portfolio investment policies, investor
     profiles, account sizes and regulatory requirements. The Independent Board
     Members noted, in particular, that


                                      120

<PAGE>



     the range of services provided to the Funds (as discussed above) is much
     more extensive than that provided to separately managed accounts. Given the
     inherent differences in the products, particularly the extensive services
     provided to the Funds, the Independent Board Members believe such facts
     justify the different levels of fees.

     3.   PROFITABILITY OF NUVEEN

     In conjunction with its review of fees, the Independent Board Members also
     considered the profitability of Nuveen for its advisory activities (which
     incorporated Nuveen's wholly-owned affiliated sub-advisers) and its
     financial condition. The Independent Board Members reviewed the revenues
     and expenses of Nuveen's advisory activities for the last two years and the
     allocation methodology used in preparing the profitability data. The
     Independent Board Members noted this information supplemented the
     profitability information requested and received during the year to help
     keep them apprised of developments affecting profitability (such as changes
     in fee waivers and expense reimbursement commitments). In this regard, the
     Independent Board Members noted that they had also appointed an Independent
     Board Member as a point person to review and keep them apprised of changes
     to the profitability analysis and/or methodologies during the year. The
     Independent Board Members considered Nuveen's profitability compared with
     other fund sponsors prepared by two independent third party service
     providers as well as comparisons of the revenues, expenses and profit
     margins of various unaffiliated management firms with similar amounts of
     assets under management prepared by Nuveen.

     In reviewing profitability, the Independent Board Members recognized the
     subjective nature of determining profitability which may be affected by
     numerous factors including the allocation of expenses. Further, the
     Independent Board Members recognized the difficulties in making comparisons
     as the profitability of other advisers generally is not publicly available
     and the profitability information that is available for certain advisers or
     management firms may not be representative of the industry and may be
     affected by, among other things, the adviser's particular business mix,
     capital costs, types of funds managed and expense allocations.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Independent Board Members reviewed Nuveen's
methodology and assumptions for allocating expenses across product lines to
determine profitability. In reviewing profitability, the Independent Board
Members recognized Nuveen's investment in its fund business.

Based on its review, the Independent Board Members concluded that Nuveen's level
of profitability for its advisory activities was reasonable in light of the
services provided.

                  In evaluating the reasonableness of the compensation, the
Independent Board Members also considered other amounts paid to NAM by the Funds
as well as any indirect benefits (such as soft dollar arrangements, if any) NAM
and its affiliates receive, or are expected to receive, that are directly
attributable to the management of the Funds, if any. See Section E below for
additional information on indirect benefits NAM may receive as a result of its
relationship with the Funds. Based on their review of the overall fee
arrangements of each Fund, the Independent Board Members determined that the
advisory fees and expenses of the respective Fund were reasonable.

D.   ECONOMIES OF SCALE AND WHETHER FEE LEVELS REFLECT THESE ECONOMIES OF SCALE

With respect to economies of scale, the Independent Board Members recognized the
potential benefits resulting from the costs of a fund being spread over a larger
asset base. The Independent Board Members therefore considered whether the Funds
have appropriately benefited from any economies of scale and whether there is
potential realization of any further economies of scale. In considering
economies of scale, the Independent Board Members have recognized that economies
of scale are difficult to measure and predict with precision, particularly on a
fund-by-fund basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one method to help ensure the
shareholders share in these benefits is to include breakpoints in the advisory
fee schedule. Accordingly, the Independent Board Members reviewed and considered
the fund-level breakpoints in the


                                      121

<PAGE>

ANNUAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
APPROVAL PROCESS (continued)


advisory fee schedules that reduce advisory fees. In this regard, given that the
Funds are closed-end funds, the Independent Board Members recognized that
although the Funds may from time to time make additional share offerings, the
growth in their assets will occur primarily through appreciation of each Fund's
investment portfolio.

In addition to fund-level advisory fee breakpoints, the Board also considered
the Funds' complex-wide fee arrangement. Pursuant to the complex-wide fee
arrangement, the fees of the funds in the Nuveen complex, including the Funds,
are reduced as the assets in the fund complex reach certain levels. In
evaluating the complex-wide fee arrangement, the Independent Board Members
recognized that the complex-wide fee schedule was recently revised in 2007 to
provide for additional fee savings to shareholders and considered the amended
schedule. The Independent Board Members further considered that the complex-wide
fee arrangement seeks to provide the benefits of economies of scale to fund
shareholders when total fund complex assets increase, even if assets of a
particular fund are unchanged or have decreased. The approach reflects the
notion that some of Nuveen's costs are attributable to services provided to all
its funds in the complex and therefore all funds benefit if these costs are
spread over a larger asset base. Based on their review, the Independent Board
Members concluded that the breakpoint schedule and complex-wide fee arrangement
were acceptable and desirable in providing benefits from economies of scale to
shareholders.

E.   INDIRECT BENEFITS

In evaluating fees, the Independent Board Members received and considered
information regarding potential "fall out" or ancillary benefits NAM or its
affiliates may receive as a result of its relationship with each Fund. In this
regard, the Independent Board Members considered revenues received by affiliates
of NAM for serving as agent at Nuveen's preferred trading desk and for serving
as a co-manager in the initial public offering of new closed-end exchange traded
funds.

In addition to the above, the Independent Board Members considered whether NAM
received any benefits from soft dollar arrangements whereby a portion of the
commissions paid by a Fund for brokerage may be used to acquire research that
may be useful to NAM in managing the assets of the Funds and other clients. The
Independent Board Members noted that NAM does not currently have any soft dollar
arrangements; however, to the extent certain bona fide agency transactions that
occur on markets that traditionally trade on a principal basis and riskless
principal transactions are considered as generating "commissions," NAM intends
to comply with the applicable safe harbor provisions.

Based on their review, the Independent Board Members concluded that any indirect
benefits received by NAM as a result of its relationship with the Funds were
reasonable and within acceptable parameters.

F.   OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

The Independent Board Members did not identify any single factor discussed
previously as all-important or controlling. The Board Members, including the
Independent Board Members, unanimously concluded that the terms of the Advisory
Agreements are fair and reasonable, that NAM's fees are reasonable in light of
the services provided to each Fund and that the Advisory Agreements be renewed.

Reinvest Automatically
 EASILY and CONVENIENTLY


NUVEEN MAKES REINVESTING EASY. A PHONE CALL IS ALL IT TAKES TO SET UP YOUR
REINVESTMENT ACCOUNT.

NUVEEN CLOSED-END FUNDS DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

Your Nuveen Closed-End Fund allows you to conveniently reinvest dividends and/or
capital gains distributions in additional Fund shares.

By choosing to reinvest, you'll be able to invest money regularly and
automatically, and watch your investment grow through the power of tax-free
compounding. Just like dividends or distributions in cash, there may be times
when income or capital gains taxes may be payable on dividends or distributions
that are reinvested.

It is important to note that an automatic reinvestment plan does not ensure a
profit, nor does it protect you against loss in a declining market.

EASY AND CONVENIENT

To make recordkeeping easy and convenient, each month you'll receive a statement
showing your total dividends and distributions, the date of investment, the
shares acquired and the price per share, and the total number of shares you own.

HOW SHARES ARE PURCHASED

The shares you acquire by reinvesting will either be purchased on the open
market or newly issued by the Fund. If the shares are trading at or above net
asset value at the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at the
greater of the net asset value or 95% of the then-current market price. If the
shares are trading at less than net asset value, shares for your account will be
purchased on the open market. If the Plan Agent begins purchasing Fund shares on
the open market while shares are trading below net asset value, but the Fund's
shares subsequently trade at or above their net asset value before the Plan
Agent is able to complete its purchases, the Plan Agent may cease open-market
purchases and may invest the uninvested portion of the distribution in
newly-issued Fund shares at a price equal to the greater of the shares' net
asset value or 95% of the shares' market value on the last business day
immediately prior to the purchase date. Dividends and distributions received to
purchase shares in the open market will normally be invested shortly after the
dividend payment date. No interest will be paid on dividends and distributions
awaiting reinvestment. Because the market price of the shares may increase
before purchases are completed, the average purchase price per share may exceed
the market price at the time of valuation, resulting in the acquisition of fewer
shares than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in shares issued by
the Fund. A pro rata portion of any applicable brokerage commissions on open
market purchases will be paid by Plan participants. These commissions usually
will be lower than those charged on individual transactions.


                                      123

<PAGE>

FLEXIBLE

You may change your distribution option or withdraw from the Plan at any time,
should your needs or situation change. Should you withdraw, you can receive a
certificate for all whole shares credited to your reinvestment account and cash
payment for fractional shares, or cash payment for all reinvestment account
shares, less brokerage commissions and a $2.50 service fee.

You can reinvest whether your shares are registered in your name, or in the name
of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee. Ask your investment advisor if his
or her firm will participate on your behalf. Participants whose shares are
registered in the name of one firm may not be able to transfer the shares to
another firm and continue to participate in the Plan.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan at any time. Although
the Fund reserves the right to amend the Plan to include a service charge
payable by the participants, there is no direct service charge to participants
in the Plan at this time.

Glossary of
TERMS USED in this REPORT

[]   AUCTION RATE BOND: An auction rate bond is a security whose interest
     payments are adjusted periodically through an auction process, which
     process typically also serves as a means for buying and selling the bond.
     Auctions that fail to attract enough buyers for all the shares offered for
     sale are deemed to have "failed", with current holders receiving a
     formula-based interest rate until the next scheduled auction.

[]   AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN: This is a commonly used method to express an
     investment's performance over a particular, usually multi-year time period.
     It expresses the return that would have been necessary each year to equal
     the investment's actual cumulative performance (including change in NAV or
     market price and reinvested dividends and capital gains distributions, if
     any) over the time period being considered.

[]   AVERAGE EFFECTIVE MATURITY: The average of the number of years to maturity
     of the bonds in a Fund's portfolio, computed by weighting each bond's time
     to maturity (the date the security comes due) by the market value of the
     security. This figure does not account for the likelihood of prepayments or
     the exercise of call provisions unless an escrow account has been
     established to redeem the bond before maturity. The market value weighting
     for an investment in an inverse floating rate security is the value of the
     portfolio's residual interest in the inverse floating rate trust, and does
     not include the value of the floating rate securities issued by the trust.

[]   INVERSE FLOATERS: Inverse floating rate securities are created by
     depositing a municipal bond, typically with a fixed interest rate, into a
     special purpose trust created by a broker-dealer. This trust, in turn, (a)
     issues floating rate certificates typically paying short-term tax-exempt
     interest rates to third parties in amounts equal to some fraction of the
     deposited bond's par amount or market value, and (b) issues an inverse
     floating rate certificate (sometimes referred to as an "inverse floater")
     to an investor (such as a Fund) interested in gaining investment exposure
     to a long-term municipal bond. The income received by the holder of the
     inverse floater varies inversely with the short-term rate paid to the
     floating rate certificates' holders, and in most circumstances the holder
     of the inverse floater bears substantially all of the underlying bond's
     downside investment risk. The holder of the inverse floater typically also
     benefits disproportionately from any potential appreciation of the
     underlying bond's value. Hence, an inverse floater essentially represents
     an investment in the underlying bond on a leveraged basis.

[]   LEVERAGE-ADJUSTED DURATION: Duration is a measure of the expected period
     over which a bond's principal and interest will be paid, and consequently
     is a measure of the sensitivity of a bond's or bond Fund's value to changes
     when market interest rates change. Generally, the longer a bond's or Fund's
     duration, the more the price of the bond or Fund will change as interest
     rates change. Leverage-adjusted duration takes into account the leveraging
     process for a Fund and therefore is longer than the duration of the Fund's
     portfolio of bonds.

[]   MARKET YIELD (ALSO KNOWN AS DIVIDEND YIELD OR CURRENT YIELD): An
     investment's current annualized dividend divided by its current market
     price.

[]   NET ASSET VALUE (NAV): A Fund's NAV per common share is calculated by
     subtracting the liabilities of the Fund (including any Preferred shares
     issued in order to leverage the Fund) from its total assets and then
     dividing the remainder by the number of common shares outstanding. Fund
     NAVs are calculated at the end of each business day.

[]   TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT YIELD: The yield necessary from a fully taxable
     investment to equal, on an after-tax basis, the yield of a municipal bond
     investment.

[]   ZERO COUPON BOND: A zero coupon bond does not pay a regular interest coupon
     to its holders during the life of the bond. Tax-exempt income to the holder
     of the bond comes from accretion of the difference between the original
     purchase price of the bond at issuance and the par value of the bond at
     maturity and is effectively paid at maturity. The market prices of zero
     coupon bonds generally are more volatile than the market prices of bonds
     that pay interest periodically.

ITEM 2. CODE OF ETHICS.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the registrant has adopted a

from the Code during the period covered by this report. The registrant has

code, click on the Shareholder Resources drop down menu box, click on Fund
Governance and then click on Code of Conduct.)

ITEM 3. AUDIT COMMITTEE FINANCIAL EXPERT.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees determined that the registrant
has at least one "audit committee financial expert" (as defined in Item 3 of
Form N-CSR) serving on its Audit Committee. The registrant's audit committee
financial expert is Jack B. Evans, who is "independent" for purposes of Item 3
of Form N-CSR.

Mr. Evans was formerly President and Chief Operating Officer of SCI Financial
Group, Inc., a full service registered broker-dealer and registered investment
adviser ("SCI"). As part of his role as President and Chief Operating Officer,
Mr. Evans actively supervised the Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO") and
actively supervised the CFO's preparation of financial statements and other
filings with various regulatory authorities. In such capacity, Mr. Evans was
actively involved in the preparation of SCI's financial statements and the
resolution of issues raised in connection therewith. Mr. Evans has also served
on the audit committee of various reporting companies. At such companies, Mr.
Evans was involved in the oversight of audits, audit plans, and the preparation
of financial statements. Mr. Evans also formerly chaired the audit committee of
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.

ITEM 4. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES.

                   Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3

The following tables show the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP, the Fund's
auditor, billed to the Fund during the Fund's last two full fiscal years. For
engagements with Ernst & Young LLP the Audit Committee approved in advance all
audit services and non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP provided to the
Fund, except for those non-audit services that were subject to the pre-approval
exception under Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X (the "pre-approval exception"). The
pre-approval exception for services provided directly to the Fund waives the
pre-approval requirement for services other than audit, review or attest
services if: (A) the aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes
no more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its
accountant during the fiscal year in which the services are provided; (B) the
Fund did not recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the
engagement; and (C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's
attention, and the Committee (or its delegate) approves the services before the
audit is completed.

The Audit Committee has delegated certain pre-approval responsibilities to its
Chairman (or, in his absence, any other member of the Audit Committee).

The following tables show the amount of fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP to
Nuveen Asset Management ("NAM" or the "Adviser"), and any entity controlling,

engagements directly related to the Fund's operations and financial reporting,
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years.

The tables also show the percentage of fees subject to the pre-approval

recognize the services as non-audit services at the time of the engagement; and
(C) the services are promptly brought to the Audit Committee's attention, and

The following table shows the amount of fees that Ernst & Young LLP billed
during the Fund's last two full fiscal years for non-audit services. The Audit
Committee is required to pre-approve non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP
provides to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Services Provider, if the
engagement related directly to the Fund's operations and financial reporting
(except for those subject to the de minimis exception described above). The
Audit Committee requested and received information from Ernst & Young LLP about
any non-audit services that Ernst & Young LLP rendered during the Fund's last
fiscal year to the Adviser and any Affiliated Fund Service Provider. The
Committee considered this information in evaluating Ernst & Young LLP's
independence.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures. Generally, the Audit
Committee must approve (i) all non-audit services to be performed for the Fund
by the Fund's independent accountants and (ii) all audit and non-audit services
to be performed by the Fund's independent accountants for the Affiliated Fund
Service Providers with respect to operations and financial reporting of the
Fund. Regarding tax and research projects conducted by the independent
accountants for the Fund and Affiliated Fund Service Providers (with respect to
operations and financial reports of the Fund) such engagements will be (i)
pre-approved by the Audit Committee if they are expected to be for amounts
greater than $10,000; (ii) reported to the Audit Committee chairman for his
verbal approval prior to engagement if they are expected to be for amounts under
$10,000 but greater than $5,000; and (iii) reported to the Audit Committee at
the next Audit Committee meeting if they are expected to be for an amount under
$5,000.

ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

The registrant's Board of Directors or Trustees has a separately designated
Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(58)(A)). The
members of the audit committee are Robert P. Bremner, Jack B. Evans, Terence J.
Toth, William J. Schneider and David J. Kundert.

ITEM 6. SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS.

See Portfolio of Investments in Item 1.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

The registrant invests its assets primarily in municipal bonds and cash
management securities. On rare occasions the registrant may acquire, directly or
through a special purpose vehicle, equity securities of a municipal bond issuer
whose bonds the registrant already owns when such bonds have deteriorated or are
expected shortly to deteriorate significantly in credit quality. The purpose of
acquiring equity securities generally will be to acquire control of the
municipal bond issuer and to seek to prevent the credit deterioration or
facilitate the liquidation or other workout of the distressed issuer's credit
problem. In the course of exercising control of a distressed municipal issuer,
NAM may pursue the registrant's interests in a variety of ways, which may entail
negotiating and executing consents, agreements and other arrangements, and
otherwise influencing the management of the issuer. NAM does not consider such
activities proxy voting for purposes of Rule 206(4)-6 under the 1940 Act, but
nevertheless provides reports to the registrant's Board of Trustees on its
control activities on a quarterly basis.

In the rare event that a municipal issuer were to issue a proxy or that the
registrant were to receive a proxy issued by a cash management security, NAM
would either engage an independent third party to determine how the proxy should
be voted or vote the proxy with the consent, or based on the instructions, of
the registrant's Board of Trustees or its representative. A member of NAM's
legal department would oversee the administration of the voting, and ensure that
records were maintained in accordance with Rule 206(4)-6, reports were filed
with the SEC on Form N-PX, and the results provided to the registrant's Board of
Trustees and made available to shareholders as required by applicable rules.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER

The following individual has primary responsibility for the day-to-day
implementation of the registrant's investment strategies:

NAME                       FUND
PAUL BRENNAN               Nuveen Dividend Advantage Municipal Fund 3.

Other Accounts Managed. In addition to managing the registrant, the portfolio
manager is also primarily responsible for the day-to-day portfolio management of
the following accounts:

                                                       NUMBER OF
PORTFOLIO MANAGER   TYPE OF ACCOUNT MANAGED            ACCOUNTS   ASSETS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Paul Brennan        Registered Investment Company      15         $12.21 billion
                    Other Pooled Investment Vehicles   0          $0
                    Other Accounts                     1          $.859 million

*    Assets are as of October 31, 2008. None of the assets in these accounts are
     subject to an advisory fee based on performance.

Compensation. Each portfolio manager's compensation consists of three basic
elements--base salary, cash bonus and long-term incentive compensation. The
compensation strategy is to annually compare overall compensation, including
these three elements, to the market in order to create a compensation structure
that is competitive and consistent with similar financial services companies. As
discussed below, several factors are considered in determining each portfolio
manager's total compensation. In any year these factors may include, among
others, the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended by the
portfolio manager's investment team, the investment performance of the accounts
managed by the portfolio manager, and the overall performance of Nuveen
Investments, Inc. (the parent company of NAM). Although investment performance
is a factor in determining the portfolio manager's compensation, it is not
necessarily a decisive factor. The portfolio manager's performance is evaluated
in part by comparing manager's performance against a specified investment
benchmark. This fund-specific benchmark is a customized subset (limited to bonds
in each Fund's specific state and with certain maturity parameters) of the
S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index, an index comprised of bonds held by
managed municipal bond fund customers of Standard & Poor's Securities Pricing,
Inc. that are priced daily and whose fund holdings aggregate at least $2
million. As of October 31, 2008, the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond index was
comprised of 52,959 securities with an aggregate current market value of $1,009
billion.

Base salary. Each portfolio manager is paid a base salary that is set at a level
determined by NAM in accordance with its overall compensation strategy discussed
above. NAM is not under any current contractual obligation to increase a
portfolio manager's base salary.

Cash bonus. Each portfolio manager is also eligible to receive an annual cash
bonus. The level of this bonus is based upon evaluations and determinations made
by each portfolio manager's supervisors, along with reviews submitted by his
peers. These reviews and evaluations often take into account a number of
factors, including the effectiveness of the investment strategies recommended to
the NAM's investment team, the performance of the accounts for which he serves
as portfolio manager relative to any benchmarks established for those accounts,
his effectiveness in communicating investment performance to stockholders and
their representatives, and his contribution to the NAM's investment process and
to the execution of investment strategies. The cash bonus component is also
impacted by the overall performance of Nuveen Investments, Inc. in achieving its
business objectives.

Long-term incentive compensation. In connection with the acquisition of Nuveen
Investments, Inc., by a group of investors lead by Madison Dearborn Partners in
November 2007, certain employees, including portfolio managers, received profit
interests in Nuveen's parent. These profit interests entitle the holders to
participate in the appreciation in the value of Nuveen beyond the issue date and
vest over five to seven years, or earlier in the case of a liquidity event.

Material Conflicts of Interest. Each portfolio manager's simultaneous management
of the registrant and the other accounts noted above may present actual or
apparent conflicts of interest with respect to the allocation and aggregation of
securities orders placed on behalf of the Registrant and the other account. NAM,
however, believes that such potential conflicts are mitigated by the fact that
the NAM has adopted several policies that address potential conflicts of
interest, including best execution and trade allocation policies that are
designed to ensure (1) that portfolio management is seeking the best price for
portfolio securities under the circumstances, (2) fair and equitable allocation
of investment opportunities among accounts over time and (3) compliance with
applicable regulatory requirements. All accounts are to be treated in a
non-preferential manner, such that allocations are not based upon account
performance, fee structure or preference of the portfolio manager, although the
allocation procedures may provide allocation preferences to funds with special
characteristics (such as favoring state funds versus national funds for
allocations of in-state bonds). In addition, NAM has adopted a Code of Conduct
that sets forth policies regarding conflicts of interest.

Beneficial Ownership of Securities. As of October 31, 2008, the portfolio
manager beneficially owned the following dollar range of equity securities
issued by the Registrant and other Nuveen Funds managed by NAM's municipal
investment team.

          accounting principles;

     (c)  evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls

          registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

     5. The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed to the
registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of
directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):

     (a)  all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
          operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
          reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
          record, process, summarize, and report financial information; and

     (b)  any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
          employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
          control over financial reporting.
