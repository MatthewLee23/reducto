       FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II (FCT)
                                  ANNUAL REPORT
                                  MAY 31, 2006

Dear Shareholders:

We are pleased to present this annual report of the First Trust/Four Corners
Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") (NYSE Symbol: FCT). The Fund
performed strongly during the one-year period covered by this report, benefiting
from a positive market environment as well as diligent portfolio management.
Well constructed sector allocations also contributed to the positive performance
of the Fund. Most importantly, the Fund experienced low net asset value
volatility because there were no defaults among the Fund's portfolio securities
and very few distressed sales over the one-year period ended May 31, 2006.

The Fund, composed primarily of senior secured floating-rate corporate loans
("Senior Loans"), seeks to provide a high level of current income. As a
secondary objective, the Fund will attempt to preserve capital. For the twelve
months ended May 31, 2006, the market continued to favor Senior Loans. A growing
U.S. economy, rising short term interest rates, and strong investor demand for
the Senior Loan asset class contributed to an attractive credit environment,
which also benefited the Fund.

Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners") is a leading asset
management firm that specializes in the sub-investment grade and structured
finance markets. I encourage you to read the portfolio commentary found on the
following pages, which includes more details about the Fund's performance and
the management strategy.

We value our relationship with our shareholders and thank you for your continued
confidence.

Sincerely,


/s/ James A. Bowen

                              PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW

The First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II ("FCT" or the
"Fund") generated a total return of 6.03%, including market price change and
distributions, for the year ended May 31, 2006 ("Fiscal 2006"). The Fund's net
asset value ("NAV") total return was 8.16% over the period. During Fiscal 2006,
the Fund paid distributions totaling $1.3022 per share compared to $0.905 in the
prior year. Based on its May dividend, FCT paid a yield of 8.0% calculated on
the Fund's share price and 7.4% based on the Fund's NAV as of May 31, 2006.

ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT

Fiscal 2006 continued to be a positive environment for senior secured
floating-rate loan ("Senior Loan") investing. In our opinion, the Fund benefited
from three key trends that were favorable to Senior Loan investing. These trends
include an attractive credit environment primarily due to a growing U.S.
economy, rising short term interest rates, and strong investor demand for the
Senior Loan asset class due to its appealing risk-adjusted returns relative to
other investment opportunities.

Gross Domestic Product ("GDP") year after year growth as of March 31, 2006
continued to expand, averaging 3.7%. Strong corporate earnings growth during
Fiscal 2006 was reflected in the GDP growth and in the credit statistics of the
companies in which the Fund invested. Healthy earnings make these companies more
able to service their debt. As a result, default rates and credit statistics for
Senior Loans remained very favorable relative to historical averages.

The robust economy led the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 16
consecutive times to the current level of 5.0% as of May 31, 2006, including 8
times (in the aggregate amount of 2.0%) during Fiscal 2006, in order to quell
inflation fears. Aside from the impact that interest rates have on the credit
statistics of companies that the Fund finances, Senior Loan managers are not
concerned with interest rate risk. Rather, in rising rate environments like we
have seen during the last year, Senior Loan income typically rises (with a
several month lag) along with Federal Reserve rate increases. One caveat is that
during the beginning of Fiscal 2006, credit spread narrowing partly offset the
benefits from rising rates. Notwithstanding the modest decline in credit
spreads, the Fund still increased its dividend 8 times during Fiscal 2006 and
demonstrated low NAV volatility.

                       PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Signs of a slowdown in GDP growth domestically and internationally have emerged
which have, among other indicators, led some economists to predict a hiatus in
Fed tightening during the upcoming fiscal year. While we acknowledge these
signals and the significant rise in interest rates since 2003, we believe that
the fundamental strength of the economy may result in further interest rate
increases. As Brian Wesbury, First Trust's Chief Economist, has commented, "The
Fed has not yet reached neutral. Call it the seventh inning. Rates should, and
most likely will, continue to rise while the economy continues to grow
strongly."

Inflows into the asset class during Fiscal 2006 were exceptional and occurred in
tandem with the strong growth in new Senior Loan issuance reported during the
year. New Senior Loan issuance rose from $248 billion in calendar year 2004 to
$291 billion in calendar year 2005. Similarly, Senior Loan market liquidity as
measured by trading volume grew nearly 20% year over year. Again, the demand for
Senior Loans remained strong as investors perceived reduced levels of risk as a
result of an improved economic environment and low levels of defaults and credit
losses. The total return benefit of a floating rate asset class also supported
Senior Loans. For calendar year 2005, Senior Loans generated a total return of
6.4% (S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index), which compares favorably to 10-year
Treasury returns of 2.3%, high yield bond returns of 2.3% (CSFB High Yield
Index), and equity returns of 4.9% (S&P 500 Index) for the same period.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND PORTFOLIO COMPOSITION

The primary objective of the Fund is to seek a high level of current income. As
a secondary objective, the Fund will attempt to preserve capital. The investment
strategy employed in managing the Fund was designed to achieve the Fund's
objectives through risk minimization during the entire economic and credit
cycles. In contrast, many managers of Senior Loan-based closed-end funds invest
up to 20% or more of their portfolios in high yield bonds in order to boost
yields in the short run. FCT is a "pure play" strategy that is generally
prohibited from investing in high yield bonds, and focuses instead on Senior
Loans. In some market environments, the Fund's pure play strategy will result in
lower current dividends/yields than some other Senior Loan-based closed-end
funds. However, we believe that our long-term thinking can result in lower NAV
volatility while maintaining competitive dividends/yield and higher long-term
total NAV returns.

Our strategy focuses on thorough fundamental credit analysis, broad issuer and
industry diversification, and a proactive sell discipline in order to minimize
risk. The Fund's portfolio is generally more heavily weighted towards industry
groups that we expect to exhibit lower earnings volatility, and which we expect
to provide high recoveries to senior lenders in circumstances where earnings
volatility does occur. We also tend to minimize exposure to those industries
that are exposed to "crosscurrents" such as changing market demand, unmanageable
costs including commodities and labor/healthcare/benefit expense, undue revenue
pressures, or other technical factors. For example, the Fund has always had very
little exposure to the airline and automotive industries, which have performed
poorly based on weak industry fundamentals as evidenced by ratings downgrades
and defaults.

The Fund is broadly diversified with over 200 positions across 40 industries. At
May 31, 2006, the five largest individual borrower exposures in total
represented 8.7% of the Fund's portfolio. The Fund also has the flexibility to
invest up to 10% of the portfolio in special situation debt investments, which
are typically investments in companies that are either in default at the time of
purchase or are experiencing financial difficulties. We view our ability to
achieve modest gains from this sub-set of Senior Loans as opportunistic rather
than obligatory, and given the growth and improvement in the economy during the
year, we saw few value opportunities in this segment of the economy. On May 31,
2006, the portfolio included two special situation investments, representing
2.8% of the Fund's portfolio.

As mentioned in prior reports, the Fund is leveraged using both adjustable-rate
Auction Market Preferred Shares and a revolving credit facility. The terms and
conditions of the leverage provide the Fund with the ability to borrow on a
floating-rate basis. Since the income generated by the Fund's Senior Loan
investment portfolio is also floating-rate, the Fund is less exposed to interest
rate mismatch risk than a closed-end fund with a fixed-rate investment
portfolio, and investors will generally benefit from portfolio leverage
regardless of short-term interest rates. At May 31, 2006, the portfolio leverage
accounted for 36.6% of the Fund's total managed assets.

PERFORMANCE REVIEW

FCT generated a market price total return of 6.0%, including distributions, for
Fiscal 2006. The Fund's NAV total return was 8.1% over the same period. This
return exceeded the benchmark (Standard & Poor's/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index)
return of 6.4%. The Fund's performance includes the beneficial impact of
leverage, and the negative impact of fees, expenses and uninvested cash
balances, which are not part of the benchmark return. The Fund's total
distributions were $1.3022 per common share in Fiscal 2006. FCT paid a yield of
8.0% calculated on the Fund's $17.61 share price and 7.4% based on the Fund's
$19.00 NAV as of May 31, 2006. Additionally, the Fund's NAV was relatively
stable during the year, ranging from a high of $19.20 to a low of $18.86, a
range of approximately 1.8%.


                                                                          Page 3

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       PORTFOLIO COMMENTARY - (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Fund's strong performance during the year was influenced by a number of
factors. We had net gains on the portfolio (realized plus unrealized), and also
benefited from favorable sector allocations. In addition to the above-mentioned
underweighting of the poor performing airline and automotive industries, we were
overweight in the building and development and business equipment and services
industries, both of which performed well during the year. Perhaps most
importantly, we had no defaults and very few distressed sales during the year,
which helped keep NAV volatility low.

Despite the Fund's strong NAV performance/total return and high yield during
Fiscal 2006, the Fund's market price performance was disappointing. During the
year, the market price of the Fund closed as high as $17.98 (August 4, 2005) and
as low as $16.55 (December 2, 2005). The Fund's closing price on May 31, 2006
was $17.61, a 1.6% decline from the Fund's closing price of $17.89 on May 31,
2005. The Fund closed the year at a 7.3% discount to its NAV.

Surprisingly, while we feel strongly that the market price performance of the
Fund during the year is not in concert with the prospects for the overall Senior
Loan asset class or the Fund, we do note that 14 of the 15 Senior Loan
closed-end funds traded at discounts to NAV on May 31, 2006, the average of the
narrower pure play group being 6.0%. FCT's market and NAV yield on May 31, 2006
(8.2% and 7.6%, respectively) compare favorably to the pure play peer group
average of 8.0% and 7.5%, respectively.

On February 6, 2006, UBS initiated coverage on FCT with a `Buy' rating. Raymond
James reiterated its `Highly Recommended' rating, the firm's highest rating, on
February 17, 2006. On June 1, 2006, AG Edwards issued its research report with a
`Buy' rating, the firm's highest rating. Other closed-end fund research analysts
publish research on the Fund, but only within their specific firms.

Additionally, since the May 31, 2006 period end, the market price for the Fund
has risen and subsequently returned to the price level of May 31, 2006. We
believe that this swing reflects the market's uncertainty with and
interpretation of Federal Reserve interest rate policy and does not reflect any
fundamental aspect of the Fund's strategy, holdings or outlook.

We remain committed to long-term performance and superior client support, and we
appreciate the opportunity to assist investors in meeting their investment
goals.

FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS - (CONTINUED)
MAY 31, 2006

  *   Senior Loans generally are subject to mandatory and/or optional
      prepayment. Prepayments of Senior Loans may occur because of mandatory
      prepayment conditions and because there may be significant economic
      incentives for a borrower to optionally prepay. As a result, the actual
      remaining maturity of Senior Loans may be substantially less than the
      stated maturities shown. Senior Loans generally have maturities that range
      from five to eight years; however, the Fund estimates that refinancing and
      prepayments result in an average maturity of the Senior Loans held in its
      portfolio to be approximately 18-30 months.
 **   Senior Loans in which the Fund invests generally pay interest at rates
      which are periodically predetermined by reference to a base lending rate
      plus a premium. These base lending rates are generally (i) the lending
      rate offered by one or more major European banks, such as the London
      Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), (ii) the prime rate offered by one or
      more major United States banks, or (iii) the certificate of deposit rate.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2006

                               1. FUND DESCRIPTION

First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund") is a
diversified, closed-end management investment company organized as a
Massachusetts business trust on March 25, 2004, and is registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"). The Fund trades under the ticker symbol FCT
on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE").

The Fund's primary investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income. As a secondary objective, the Fund will attempt to preserve capital. The
Fund will pursue these objectives through investment in a portfolio of senior
secured floating rate corporate loans ("Senior Loans"). There can be no
assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objectives. Investment in
Senior Loans involves credit risk and, during periods of generally declining
credit quality, it may be particularly difficult for the Fund to achieve its
secondary investment objective. The Fund may not be appropriate for all
investors.

                       2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies consistently
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION:

The net asset value ("NAV") of the Common Shares of the Fund is computed based
upon the value of the Fund's portfolio and other assets less any accrued
liabilities. The NAV is determined as of the close of regular trading on the
NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, on each day the NYSE is open for trading.
Domestic debt securities and foreign securities are priced using data reflecting
the earlier closing of the principal markets for those securities. The Fund
calculates NAV per Common Share by subtracting the Fund's liabilities (including
accrued expenses, dividends payable and any borrowings of the Fund) and the
liquidation value of any outstanding Preferred Shares from the Fund's Total
Assets (the value of securities and other investments the Fund holds plus cash
or other assets, including interest accrued but not yet received), and dividing
the result by the total number of Common Shares outstanding.

The Fund's investments are valued daily at market value or, in the absence of
market value with respect to any portfolio securities, at fair value according
to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees. A majority of the Fund's
assets are valued using market information supplied by third parties. In the
event that market quotations are not readily available, the pricing service does
not provide a valuation for a particular asset, or the valuations are deemed
unreliable, or if events occurring after the close of the principal markets for
particular securities (e.g., domestic debt and foreign securities), but before
the Fund values its assets, would materially affect NAV, First Trust Advisors
L.P. ("First Trust") may use a fair value method to value the Fund's securities
and investments. The use of fair value pricing by the Fund is governed by
valuation procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and in accordance
with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

The Senior Loans in which the Fund invests are not listed on any securities
exchange or board of trade. Senior Loans are typically bought and sold by
institutional investors in individually negotiated private transactions that
function in many respects like an over-the-counter secondary market, although
typically no formal market-makers exist. This market, while having grown
substantially in the past several years, generally has fewer trades and less
liquidity than the secondary market for other types of securities. Some Senior
Loans have few or no trades, or trade infrequently, and information regarding a
specific Senior Loan may not be widely available or may be incomplete.
Accordingly, determinations of the market value of Senior Loans may be based on
infrequent and dated information. Because there is less reliable, objective data
available, elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation of Senior
Loans than for other types of securities. Typically Senior Loans are valued
using information provided by an independent third party pricing service. If the
pricing service cannot or does not provide a valuation for a particular Senior
Loan or such valuation is deemed unreliable, First Trust may value such Senior
Loan at a fair value according to procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of
Trustees, and in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act.

Portfolio securities listed on any exchange other than the NASDAQ National
Market ("NASDAQ") are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of
which such value is being determined. If there has been no sale on such day, the
securities are valued at the mean of the most recent bid and asked prices on
such day. Securities traded on the NASDAQ are valued at the NASDAQ Official
Closing Price as


                                                                         Page 23

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2006

determined by NASDAQ. Portfolio securities traded on more than one securities
exchange are valued at the last sale price on the business day as of which such
value is being determined at the close of the exchange representing the
principal market for such securities. Portfolio securities traded in the
over-the-counter market, but excluding securities traded on the NASDAQ, are
valued at the closing bid prices. Short-term investments that mature in less
than 60 days are valued at amortized cost.

B. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS:

The Fund engages in repurchase agreement transactions. Under the terms of a
typical repurchase agreement, the Fund takes possession of an underlying debt
obligation subject to an obligation of the seller to repurchase, and the Fund to
resell, the obligation at an agreed-upon price and time, thereby determining the
yield during the Fund's holding period. This arrangement results in a fixed rate
of return that is not subject to market fluctuations during the Fund's holding
period. The value of the collateral is at all times at least equal to the total
amount of the repurchase obligation, including interest. In the event of
counterparty default, the Fund has the right to use the collateral to offset
losses incurred. There is potential loss to the Fund in the event the Fund is
delayed or prevented from exercising its rights to dispose of the collateral
securities, including the risk of a possible decline in the value of the
underlying securities during the period while the Fund seeks to assert its
rights. The Fund reviews the value of the collateral and the creditworthiness of
those banks and dealers with which the Fund enters into repurchase agreements to
evaluate potential risks.

C. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:

Securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from securities transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis.
Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Market premiums and discounts
are amortized over the expected life of each respective borrowing.

Securities purchased or sold on a when-issued or delayed-delivery basis may be
settled a month or more after the trade date; interest income on such securities
is not accrued until settlement date. The Fund instructs the Custodian to
segregate assets of the Fund with a current value at least equal to the amount
of its when-issued purchase commitments.

D. UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS:

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund had unfunded loan commitments of approximately $6,328,405
as of May 31, 2006. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the
borrower's discretion. Net unrealized depreciation of $20,500 from these
commitments is included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities.

E. RESTRICTED SECURITIES:

The Fund may invest a portion of its assets in restricted securities. Restricted
securities are securities that cannot be offered for public sale without first
being registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Fund
currently holds the restricted securities shown in the following table. The Fund
does not have the right to demand that such securities be registered. These
securities are valued using market quotations according to the valuation
procedures as stated in the Portfolio Valuation section (Note 2A) and are not
expressed as a discount to the carrying value of a comparable unrestricted
security. There are no unrestricted securities with the same maturity dates and
yields for these issuers.

F. DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS:

The Fund will distribute to holders of its Common Shares monthly dividends of
all or a portion of its net income after the payment of interest and dividends
in connection with the financing associated with leverage. If the Fund
recognizes a long-term capital gain, it will be required to allocate such gain
between the Common Shares and Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
issued by the Fund in proportion to the total dividends paid for the year.
Distributions will automatically be reinvested into additional Common Shares
pursuant to the Fund's Dividend Reinvestment Plan unless cash distributions are
elected by the shareholder.

Distributions from income and capital gains are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments of income and gains on various investment securities held
by the Fund, timing differences and differing characterization of distributions
made by the Fund. Permanent differences incurred during the year ended May 31,
2006, resulting in book and tax accounting differences have been reclassified at
year end to reflect an increase in undistributed net investment income by
$1,255,553 and an increase in accumulated net realized loss on investments sold
by $1,255,553. Net assets were not affected by this reclassification.

The tax character of distributions paid during the fiscal years ended May 31,
2006 and May 31, 2005 is as follows:

                                                       2006           2005
                                                    ------------   -------------
Distributions paid from:
Ordinary Income..................................   $ 36,953,889   $  24,738,405

As of May 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings on a tax basis are
as follows:

Undistributed Ordinary Income....................   $   3,191,642
Net Unrealized Appreciation......................   $     914,840

G. INCOME TAXES:

The Fund intends to continue to qualify as a regulated investment company by
complying with the requirements under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and by distributing substantially all of its net investment
income and net realized gains to shareholders. Accordingly, no provision has
been made for federal or state income taxes.

As of May 31, 2006, the Fund had a capital loss carryforward for federal income
tax purposes of $4,136,367, expiring on May 31, 2014.

H. EXPENSES:

The Fund will pay all expenses directly related to its operations.

I. COMMON SHARE ORGANIZATION AND OFFERING COSTS:

Organization costs consist of costs incurred to establish the Fund and enable it
to legally do business. These costs include filing fees, listing fees, legal
services pertaining to the organization of the business and audit fees relating
to the initial registration and auditing the initial statement of assets and
liabilities, among other fees. Offering costs consist of legal fees pertaining
to the Fund's shares offered for sale, registration fees, underwriting fees, and
printing of the initial prospectus, among other fees. First Trust and Four
Corners Capital Management, LLC ("Four Corners" or the "Sub-Advisor") have paid
all organization expenses and all offering costs of the Fund (other than sales
load) that exceed $0.04 per Common Share. The Fund's estimated share of Common
Share offering costs, $89,000, was recorded as a reduction of the proceeds from
the sale of Common Shares during the year ended May 31, 2005.


                                                                         Page 25

          3. INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEE AND OTHER AFFILIATED TRANSACTIONS

First Trust is a limited partnership with one limited partner, Grace Partners of
DuPage, L.P., and one general partner, The Charger Corporation. First Trust
serves as investment advisor to the Fund pursuant to an Investment Management
Agreement. First Trust is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the Fund's
investment portfolio, managing the Fund's business affairs and certain
administrative services necessary for the management of the Fund. For these
services, First Trust is entitled to a monthly fee calculated at an annual rate
of 0.75% of the Fund's Managed Assets, the average daily gross asset value of
the Fund (which includes assets attributable to the Fund's AMP Shares, and the
principal amount of borrowings) minus the sum of the Fund's accrued and unpaid
dividends on any outstanding AMP Shares and accrued liabilities.

Four Corners serves as the Fund's sub-advisor and manages the Fund's portfolio
subject to First Trust's supervision. Four Corners receives an annual portfolio
management fee of 0.38% of Managed Assets that is paid monthly by First Trust
from its investment advisory fee.

PFPC Inc. ("PFPC"), an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial
Services Group, Inc., serves as the Fund's Administrator and Transfer Agent in
accordance with certain fee arrangements. PFPC Trust Company, also an indirect,
majority-owned subsidiary of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc., serves as
the Fund's Custodian in accordance with certain fee arrangements.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank
AG ("Auction Agent"), serves as the Fund's AMP Share transfer agent, registrar,
dividend disbursing agent and redemption agent.

The Fund pays each Trustee who is not an officer or employee of First Trust or
any of their affiliates ("Disinterested Trustees") an annual retainer of
$10,000, which includes compensation for all board and committee meetings. Until
December 31, 2005, additional fees of $1,000 and $500 were paid to Disinterested
Trustees for special board meetings and non-regular committee meetings,
respectively. These additional fees were shared by the funds in the First Trust
fund complex that participated in that particular meeting and were not per fund
fees. Trustees are also reimbursed for travel and out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with all meetings. Effective January 1, 2006, the Disinterested
Trustees are no longer paid additional fees for special board meetings and
non-regular committee meetings.

                      4. PURCHASES AND SALES OF SECURITIES

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of investment securities, excluding
short-term investments, for the year ended May 31, 2006, aggregated amounts were
$615,215,951 and $625,350,931, respectively.

As of May 31, 2006, the aggregate gross unrealized appreciation for all
securities in which there was an excess of value over tax cost was $2,636,751
and the aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which
there was an excess of tax cost over value was $1,721,911.

                                5. COMMON SHARES

As of May 31, 2006, 25,272,768 of $0.01 par value Common Shares were issued. An
unlimited number of Common Shares have been authorized under the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                                  MAY 31, 2006

                       6. AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED SHARES

The Fund's Declaration of Trust authorizes the issuance of an unlimited number
of preferred shares of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, in one or
more classes or series, with rights as determined by the Board of Trustees
without the approval of Common Shareholders. As of May 31, 2006, the Fund has
2,000 Series A and 2,000 Series B Auction Market Preferred Shares ("AMP Shares")
outstanding at a liquidation value of $25,000 per share. The AMP Shares offering
costs of $299,751 and commissions of $1,000,000, paid directly to Lehman
Brothers, were charged to capital of Common Shares for the year ended May 31,
2005.

The Fund is required to meet certain asset coverage tests with respect to the
AMP Shares. If the Fund fails to maintain Eligible Assets having an aggregated
Discounted Value at least equal to the AMP Shares Basic Maintenance Amount as of
any Valuation Date and the failure is not cured on or before the related Asset
Coverage Cure Date, the Fund will be required in certain circumstances to redeem
certain AMP Shares.

An auction of the Series A AMP Shares is generally held every 7 days and an
auction of the Series B AMP Shares is generally held every 28 days. Existing
shareholders may submit an order to hold, bid or sell such shares at par value
on each auction date.

The annual dividend rate in effect as of May 31, 2006 was 4.80% and 4.98% for
the Series A 7 day and Series B 28 day auctions, respectively. The dividend
rate, as set by the auction process, is generally expected to vary with
short-term interest rates. The high and low annual dividend rates during the
year ended May 31, 2006, for the Series A 7 day auction were 4.82% and 3.02%,
respectively, and the average dividend rate was 3.92%. The high and low annual
dividend rates during the year ended May 31, 2006, for the Series B 28 day
auction were 4.95% and 3.09%, respectively, and the average dividend rate was
4.05%. These rates may vary in a manner not related directly to the income
received on the Fund's assets, which could have either a beneficial or
detrimental impact on net investment income and gains available to Common
Shareholders.

Under Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) promulgating Topic D-98, Classification
and Measurement of Redeemable Securities, which was issued on July 19, 2001,
preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets are to be
classified outside of permanent equity to the extent that the redemption is at a
fixed or determinable price and at the option of the holder or upon the
occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer.
Subject to guidance of the EITF, the Fund's AMP Shares are classified outside of
permanent equity (net assets attributable to Common Shares) in the accompanying
financial statements.

                          7. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

On August 2, 2004, the Fund entered into a 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility
("Credit Facility") with various lenders and Citicorp North America Inc., as
agent, to be used as leverage for the Fund. On August 1, 2005, this Credit
Facility was amended to extend its expiration date to July 31, 2006. The Credit
Facility provides for a secured line of credit for the Fund, where Fund assets
are pledged against advances made to the Fund. Under the requirements of the
1940 Act, the Fund, immediately after any such borrowings, must have an "asset
coverage" of at least 300% (33-1/3% of the Fund's total assets after
borrowings). The total commitment under the Credit Facility is $195,000,000. For
the year ended May 31, 2006, the average amount outstanding was $170,424,658.
The high and low annual interest rates during the year ended May 31, 2006, were
4.98% and 3.04%, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.05%.
The annual interest rate in effect at May 31, 2006 was 4.98%. The Fund also pays
additional borrowing costs, which include an administration fee of 0.02%, a
program fee of 0.20% and a liquidity fee of 0.14% per year. Such expenses are
included in "Interest and fees on outstanding loan payable" on the Statement of
Operations.

                              8. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

On May 22, 2006, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.1198 per share, which
represents a dividend from net investment income to Common Shareholders of
record June 5, 2006, payable June 15, 2006.

On June 20, 2006, the Fund declared a dividend of $0.1198 per share, which

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR
FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II:

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of First
Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "Fund"), including
the portfolio of investments, as of May 31, 2006, the related statements of
operations and cash flows for the year then ended, the statements of changes in
net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended and the financial
highlights for the periods presented. These financial statements and financial
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation
of securities owned as of May 31, 2006, by correspondence with the Fund's
custodian, brokers and selling or agent banks; where replies were not received
from selling or agent banks, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Fund as of May 31, 2006, the results of its operations and its cash flows, the
changes in its net assets, and the financial highlights for the respective
stated periods, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America.

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                            MAY 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

                           DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN

If your Common Shares are registered directly with the Fund or if you hold your
Common Shares with a brokerage firm that participates in the Fund's Dividend
Reinvestment Plan (the "Plan"), unless you elect, by written notice to the Fund,
to receive cash distributions, all dividends, including any capital gain
distributions, on your Common Shares will be automatically reinvested by PFPC
Inc. (the "Plan Agent"), in additional Common Shares under the Plan. If you
elect to receive cash distributions, you will receive all distributions in cash
paid by check mailed directly to you by PFPC Inc., as the dividend paying agent.

If you decide to participate in the Plan, the number of Common Shares you will
receive will be determined as follows:

      (1)   If Common Shares are trading at or above net asset value ("NAV") at
            the time of valuation, the Fund will issue new shares at a price
            equal to the greater of (i) NAV per Common Share on that date or
            (ii) 95% of the market price on that date.

      (2)   If Common Shares are trading below NAV at the time of valuation, the
            Plan Agent will receive the dividend or distribution in cash and
            will purchase Common Shares in the open market, on the NYSE or
            elsewhere, for the participants' accounts. It is possible that the
            market price for the Common Shares may increase before the Plan
            Agent has completed its purchases. Therefore, the average purchase
            price per share paid by the Plan Agent may exceed the market price
            at the time of valuation, resulting in the purchase of fewer shares
            than if the dividend or distribution had been paid in Common Shares
            issued by the Fund. The Plan Agent will use all dividends and
            distributions received in cash to purchase Common Shares in the open
            market within 30 days of the valuation date except where temporary
            curtailment or suspension of purchases is necessary to comply with
            federal securities laws. Interest will not be paid on any uninvested
            cash payments.

You may elect to opt-out of or withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving
written notice to the Plan Agent, or by telephone at (800) 331-1710, in
accordance with such reasonable requirements as the Plan Agent and Fund may
agree upon. If you withdraw or the Plan is terminated, you will receive a
certificate for each whole share in your account under the Plan, and you will
receive a cash payment for any fraction of a share in your account. If you wish,
the Plan Agent will sell your shares and send you the proceeds, minus brokerage
commissions.

The Plan Agent maintains all Common Shareholders' accounts in the Plan and gives
written confirmation of all transactions in the accounts, including information
you may need for tax records. Common Shares in your account will be held by the
Plan Agent in non-certificated form. The Plan Agent will forward to each
participant any proxy solicitation material and will vote any shares so held
only in accordance with proxies returned to the Fund. Any proxy you receive will
include all Common Shares you have received under the Plan.

There is no brokerage charge for reinvestment of your dividends or distributions
in Common Shares. However, all participants will pay a pro rata share of
brokerage commissions incurred by the Plan Agent when it makes open market
purchases.

Automatically reinvesting dividends and distributions does not mean that you do
not have to pay income taxes due upon receiving dividends and distributions.
Capital gains and income are realized although cash is not received by you.
Consult your financial advisor for more information.

If you hold your Common Shares with a brokerage firm that does not participate
in the Plan, you will not be able to participate in the Plan and any dividend
reinvestment may be effected on different terms than those described above.

The Fund reserves the right to amend or terminate the Plan if in the judgment of
the Board of Trustees the change is warranted. There is no direct service charge
to participants in the Plan; however, the Fund reserves the right to amend the
Plan to include a service charge payable by the participants. Additional
information about the Plan may be obtained by writing PFPC Inc., 301 Bellevue
Parkway, Wilmington, Delaware 19809.

                         NYSE CERTIFICATION INFORMATION

In accordance with Section 303A-12 of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
Listed Company Manual, the Fund's President has certified to the NYSE that, as
of November 2, 2005, he was not aware of any violation by the Fund of NYSE
corporate governance listing standards. In addition, the Fund's reports to the
SEC on forms N-CSR, N-CSRS and N-Q contain certifications by the Fund's
principal executive officer and principal financial officer that relate to the
Fund's public disclosure in such reports and are required by the Rule 30a-2
under the 1940 Act.

                               ADVISORY AGREEMENT

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS REGARDING CONTINUATION OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND
SUB-ADVISORY CONTRACTS

The Trustees unanimously approved the continuation of the Investment Management
Agreement (the "AGREEMENT") between First Trust Advisors L.P. ("FIRST TRUST")
and First Trust/Four Corners Senior Floating Rate Income Fund II (the "FUND") at
a meeting held on March 13, 2006. The Board of Trustees determined that the
Agreement is in the best interests of the Fund and that the compensation
arrangement set forth in the Agreement is fair and reasonable in light of the
nature, extent and quality of the services provided by First Trust and such
other matters as the Trustees considered to be relevant in the exercise of their
reasonable business judgment.

To reach this determination, the Trustees considered their duties under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 ACT") as well as under the
general principles of state law in reviewing and approving advisory contracts;
the requirements of the 1940 Act in such matters; the fiduciary duty of
investment advisers with respect to advisory agreements and compensation; the
standards used by courts in determining whether investment company boards have
fulfilled their duties; and the factors to be considered by the Trustees in
voting on such agreements. The Independent Trustees received advice from
independent legal counsel. The Trustees also applied their business judgment to
determine whether the arrangement between the Fund and First Trust was a
reasonable business arrangement from the Fund's perspective as well as from the
perspective of its shareholders. In reviewing such arrangement, the Board of
Trustees considered factors such as the nature, quality and extent of services
provided by First Trust under the Agreement and the fairness of the fee charged,
whether the fee level reflects any economies of scale, and any profitability
realized by First Trust under the Agreement.

The Trustees considered the nature, quality and extent of services provided by
First Trust, including the overall administration of the Fund and First Trust's
oversight of Four Corners Capital Management, LLC ("FOUR CORNERS"), the Fund's
sub-advisor. The Board considered the experience and skills of the personnel
primarily responsible for providing services to the Fund and noted the
compliance program that had been developed by First Trust. In light of these
considerations and their overall familiarity with First Trust, the Trustees
concluded that the nature, quality and extent of services provided by First
Trust to the Fund have been and are expected to remain satisfactory.

The Trustees reviewed data prepared by Lipper Inc. ("LIPPER"), an independent
source, showing the management fees and expense ratios of the Fund compared to
those of a peer group that included seven other closed-end loan participation
funds using preferred stock leverage or debt leverage. The Trustees also
considered the Fund's management fees and expense ratios as compared to a second
peer group of thirteen other closed-end loan participation funds currently using
preferred stock leverage or debt leverage, as selected by First Trust using data
compiled by Lipper. The Trustees noted that the Fund's management fees were
below the median of the Lipper peer group and above the median of the First
Trust-selected peer group, and the Fund's expense ratios were in the third
quintile of both peer groups. The Trustees also considered the advisory fees
paid to First Trust by similar funds, and noted that First Trust did not provide

          FIRST TRUST/FOUR CORNERS SENIOR FLOATING RATE INCOME FUND II
                            MAY 31, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

advisory services to clients other than closed-end funds with investment
objectives and policies similar to the Fund. The Trustees also considered the
Fund's performance for the one year and since-inception periods ended December
31, 2005 as compared to that of a relevant benchmark index and the other
closed-end funds in the peer group and performance universe selected by Lipper
and the peer group and performance universe selected by First Trust. The Board
noted that the Fund's performance was around or above the median of both peer
groups and performance universes for the one-year period and that the Fund
outperformed its benchmark for both periods considered. In addition, the
Trustees considered the market price and net asset value performance of the Fund
since inception, and compared the Fund's premium/discount to the average and
median premium/discount of each peer group, noting that the Fund's
premium/discount was indicative of the asset class. The Trustees concluded that
the Fund's performance was reasonable, particularly in light of the small number
of funds managed in a similar "pure play" style, without a high yield bond
component. On the basis of the information provided, the Trustees concluded that
the Fund's management fees were reasonable and appropriate in light of the
nature, quality and extent of services provided by First Trust.

The Trustees noted that First Trust has continued to invest in personnel and
infrastructure but had not identified any economies of scale realized by the
Fund and had indicated that, because the Fund is a closed-end fund that is not
issuing more shares other than pursuant to its dividend reinvestment plan, First
Trust believed that any discussion of economies of scale was not meaningful. The
Trustees concluded that the management fee reflects an appropriate level of
sharing of any economies of scale. The Trustees also considered the costs of the
services provided and profits realized by First Trust from its relationship with
the Fund for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005, as set forth in the
materials provided to the Board. The Trustees noted the inherent limitations in
the profitability analysis, and concluded that First Trust's profitability
appeared to be not unreasonable in light of the services provided to the Fund.
In addition, the Trustees considered and discussed any ancillary benefits
derived by First Trust from its relationship with the Fund and noted that First
Trust receives no brokerage or soft dollars from the Fund and therefore the
typical fall out benefits are not present. The Trustees concluded that any other
fall out benefits received by First Trust or its affiliates would appear to be
attenuated. Based on all of the factors considered, the Trustees concluded that
it was in the best interests of the Fund to approve the continuation of the
Agreement, including the fees to be charged for the services thereunder. No
single factor was determinative in the Board's analysis.

At the March 13, 2006 meeting, the Trustees also approved the continuation of
the Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement (the "SUB- ADVISORY AGREEMENT") among the
Fund, First Trust and Four Corners, after considering the factors discussed
above, as well as the following information. The Trustees considered the nature,
quality and extent of services provided by Four Corners under the Sub- Advisory
Agreement. They received a presentation from representatives of Four Corners.
They concluded that Four Corners had managed the Fund consistent with its
investment objectives and policies. The Trustees considered the sub-advisory fee
rate (which is paid by First Trust out of the management fee it receives from
the Fund) as compared to the sub-advisory fees of one other sub-advised loan
participation fund that uses preferred stock leverage, based on data provided by
Lipper, and noted that the Fund's sub-advisory fee rate was higher but within an
acceptable range of the other, larger fund. The Trustees also considered
information provided by Four Corners as to the fees it charges to other clients,
which generally were higher than those it receives under the Sub-Advisory
Agreement. The Trustees considered that Four Corners' investment services
expenses are primarily fixed, and that Four Corners had added personnel in the
past year to improve the quality and consistency of service and anticipated
continued investments in personnel and systems. Based on the information
provided, the Trustees concluded that the sub-advisory fees were reasonable. The
Trustees considered the sub-advisory fee rate and how it related to the overall
management fee structure of the Fund. The Trustees considered that the
sub-advisory fee rate was negotiated at arm's length between First Trust and
Four Corners, an unaffiliated third party, and that First Trust compensates Four
Corners from its management fee. The Trustees also considered data provided by
Four Corners as to the profitability of the Sub-Advisory Agreement to Four
Corners, noting that the method used to allocate expenses was not a typical
practice of Four Corners. The Trustees noted the inherent limitations in this
profitability analysis and concluded that the profitability analysis for First
Trust was more relevant, although the profitability of the Sub-Advisory
Agreement appeared to be not unreasonable in light of the services provided to
the Fund. The Trustees noted that Four Corners does not maintain any soft-dollar
arrangements and that Four Corners indicated that it does not receive any
material fall out benefits from its relationship to the Fund. Based on all of
the factors considered, the Trustees concluded that it was in the best interests
of the Fund to approve the continuation of the Sub-Advisory Agreement, including
the fees to be charged for the services thereunder. No single factor was
determinative in the Board's analysis.

         Registrant,  other than the services reported in paragraphs (a) through
         (c) of this Item were  $35,450 and  $77,927,  respectively.  These fees

     (e)(1) Disclose the audit committee's  pre-approval policies and procedures
         described in paragraph (c)(7) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.

         Pursuant  to  its  charter  and  its  Audit  and   Non-Audit   Services
Pre-Approval  Policy  adopted  December  12,  2005,  the  Audit  Committee  (the
"COMMITTEE")  is  responsible  for the  pre-approval  of all audit  services and
permitted  non-audit  services  (including  the fees and  terms  thereof)  to be
performed for the Registrant by its  independent  auditors.  The Chairman of the
Committee is authorized to give such pre-approvals on behalf of the Committee up
to $25,000 and report any such pre-approval to the full Committee.

         The  Committee  is  also   responsible  for  the  pre-approval  of  the
independent  auditor's  engagements for non-audit services with the Registrant's
adviser  (not  including  a  sub-adviser  whose  role  is  primarily   portfolio
management and is sub-contracted or overseen by another investment  adviser) and
any  entity  controlling,  controlled  by  or  under  common  control  with  the
investment  adviser that provides  ongoing  services to the  Registrant,  if the
engagement  relates  directly to the operations  and financial  reporting of the
Registrant,  subject  to  the  DE  MINIMIS  exceptions  for  non-audit  services
described  in Rule  2-01 of  Regulation  S-X.  If the  independent  auditor  has
provided  non-audit  services  to  the  Registrant's  adviser  (other  than  any
sub-adviser whose role is primarily  portfolio  management and is sub-contracted
with or  overseen by another  investment  adviser)  and any entity  controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the investment  adviser that provides
ongoing services to the Registrant that were

<PAGE>

not pre-approved  pursuant  to  the  DE MINIMIS  exception,  the Committee  will
consider  whether  the provision of such non-audit services is  compatible  with
the auditor's independence.

     (e)(2) The  percentage  of services  described  in each of  paragraphs  (b)
         through (d) for the Registrant and the Registrant's  investment adviser
         of this Item that were  approved  by the audit  committee  pursuant  to
         paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X are as follows:

                           (b) 0%

                           (c) 0%

                           (d) 0%

     (f) The  percentage  of  hours  expended  on  the  principal   accountant's
         engagement to audit the registrant's  financial statements for the most
         recent fiscal year that were  attributed  to work  performed by persons
         other than the principal  accountant's  full-time,  permanent employees
         was less than fifty percent.

     (g) The aggregate non-audit fees billed by the Registrant's  accountant for
         services  rendered to the Registrant,  and rendered to the Registrant's
         investment  adviser  (not  including  any  sub-adviser  whose  role  is
         primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by
         another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by,
         or under common control with the adviser that provides ongoing services
         to the  Registrant  for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2005 and May 31,
         2006 were  $12,500 and $36,167,  respectively  for the  Registrant  and
         $61,450  and  $90,602,  respectively  for the  Registrant's  investment
         adviser.

     (h) Not applicable. The audit committee pre-approved all non-audit services
         rendered  to  the  Registrant's   investment  adviser  and  any  entity
         controlling,  controlled  by or under  common  control with the adviser
         that provides ongoing services to the Registrant.



ITEM 5. AUDIT COMMITTEE OF LISTED REGISTRANTS.

the independent  trustees of the  Registrant.  For the fiscal period ending  May
31, 2006, the members of the audit  committee  are: Thomas  R.  Kadlec,  Niel B.
Nielson,  Richard E. Erickson and Robert F. Keith.

<PAGE>

                           FIRST TRUST ADVISORS, L.P.
                                FIRST TRUST FUNDS
                             PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

         First Trust Advisors, L.P. (the "ADVISER") serves as investment adviser
providing  discretionary  investment  advisory  services  for  several  open  or
closed-end  investment companies (the "FUNDS").  As part of these services,  the
Adviser  has full  responsibility  for  proxy  voting  and  related  duties.  In
fulfilling  these  duties,  the  Adviser and Funds have  adopted  the  following
policies and procedures:

1.            It is the  Adviser's  policy to seek to ensure  that  proxies  for
              securities held by a Fund are voted consistently and solely in the
              best economic interests of the respective Fund.

2.            The Adviser  shall be  responsible  for the  oversight of a Fund's
              proxy voting process and shall assign a senior member of its staff
              to be responsible for this oversight.

3.            The Adviser has engaged the services of Institutional  Shareholder
              Services,  Inc. ("ISS") to make  recommendations to the Adviser on
              the voting of proxies  related to securities  held by a Fund.  ISS
              provides voting  recommendations  based on established  guidelines
              and  practices.  The Adviser has  adopted  these ISS Proxy  Voting
              Guidelines.

4.            The Adviser  shall review the ISS  recommendations  and  generally
              will vote the  proxies in  accordance  with such  recommendations.
              Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Adviser  may  not  vote  in
              accordance with the ISS  recommendations  if the Adviser  believes
              that the specific ISS  recommendation is not in the best interests
              of the respective Fund.

5.            If the Adviser manages the assets or pension fund of a company and
              any of the Adviser's  clients hold any securities in that company,
              the  Adviser  will  vote  proxies   relating  to  such   company's
              securities in accordance with the ISS recommendations to avoid any
              conflict  of  interest.  In  addition,  if the  Adviser has actual
              knowledge  of any other  type of  material  conflict  of  interest
              between itself and the respective  Fund with respect to the voting
              of a  proxy,  the  Adviser  shall  vote  the  applicable  proxy in
              accordance with the ISS  recommendations to avoid such conflict of
              interest.

6.            If  a  Fund  requests  the  Adviser  to  follow   specific  voting
              guidelines or additional guidelines,  the Adviser shall review the
              request and follow such guidelines,  unless the Adviser determines
              that it is unable to follow  such  guidelines.  In such case,  the
              Adviser  shall  inform  the Fund that it is not able to follow the
              Fund's request.

7.            The Adviser  may have  clients in addition to the Funds which have
              provided the Adviser with discretionary  authority to vote proxies
              on their behalf.  In such cases, the Adviser shall follow the same
              policies and procedures.

================================================================================

1. OPERATIONAL ITEMS

ADJOURN MEETING

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to provide management with the authority to
adjourn an annual or special meeting absent compelling reasons to support the
proposal.

Vote FOR proposals that relate specifically to soliciting votes for a merger or
transaction if supporting that merger or transaction. Vote AGAINST proposals if
the wording is too vague or if the proposal includes "other business."

AMEND QUORUM REQUIREMENTS

Vote AGAINST proposals to reduce quorum requirements for shareholder meetings
below a majority of the shares outstanding unless there are compelling reasons
to support the proposal.

AMEND MINOR BYLAWS

Vote FOR bylaw or charter changes that are of a housekeeping nature (updates or
corrections).

CHANGE COMPANY NAME

Vote FOR proposals to change the corporate name.

CHANGE DATE, TIME, OR LOCATION OF ANNUAL MEETING

Vote FOR management proposals to change the date/time/location of the annual
meeting unless the proposed change is unreasonable.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals to change the date/time/location of the
annual meeting unless the current scheduling or location is unreasonable.

RATIFYING AUDITORS

Vote FOR proposals to ratify auditors, unless any of the following apply:

      o     An auditor has a financial interest in or association with the
            company, and is therefore not independent,

      o     There is reason to believe that the independent auditor has rendered
            an opinion which is neither accurate nor indicative of the company's
            financial position, or

      o     Fees for non-audit services ("Other" fees) are excessive.

Non-audit fees are excessive if:

Non-audit ("other") fees >audit fees + audit-related fees + tax
compliance/preparation fees

Tax compliance and preparation include the preparation of original and amended
tax returns, refund claims and tax payment planning. All other services in the
tax category, such as tax advice, planning or consulting should be added to
"Other" fees. If the breakout of tax fees cannot be determined, add all tax fees
to "Other" fees.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking companies to prohibit or limit
their auditors from engaging in non-audit services.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOOTNOTES:

1     "Affiliate" includes a subsidiary, sibling company, or parent company. ISS
      uses 50 percent control ownership by the parent company as the standard
      for applying its affiliate designation.

2     "Executives" (officers subject to Section 16 of the Securities and
      Exchange Act of 1934) include the chief executive, operating, financial,
      legal, technology, and accounting officers of a company (including the
      president, treasurer, secretary, controller, or any vice president in
      charge of a principal business unit, division or policy function).

3     ISS will look at the terms of the interim CEO's employment contract to
      determine if it contains severance pay, long-term health and pension
      benefits or other such standard provisions typically contained in
      contracts of permanent, non-temporary CEOs. ISS will also consider if a
      formal search process was underway for a full-time CEO at the time.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4     "Relative" follows the NYSE definition of "immediate family members" which
      covers: spouses, parents, children, siblings, in-laws, and anyone sharing
      the director's home.

5     If the company makes or receives annual payments exceeding the greater of
      $200,000 or five percent of the recipient's gross revenues. (The recipient
      is the party receiving the financial proceeds from the transaction).

6     Interlocks include: (a) executive officers serving as directors on each
      other's compensation or similar committees (or, in the absence of such a
      committee, on the board) or (b) executive officers sitting on each other's
      boards and at least one serves on the other's compensation or similar
      committees (or, in the absence of such a committee, on the board).

7     The operating involvement of the Founder with the company will be
      considered. Little to no operating involvement may cause ISS to deem the
      Founder as an independent outsider.

8     For purposes of ISS' director independence classification, "material" will
      be defined as a standard of relationship (financial, personal or
      otherwise) that a reasonable person might conclude could potentially
      influence one's objectivity in the boardroom in a manner that would have a
      meaningful impact on an individual's ability to satisfy requisite
      fiduciary standards on behalf of shareholders.

liability protection using Delaware law as the standard.

Vote AGAINST proposals to eliminate entirely directors' and officers' liability

Vote AGAINST indemnification proposals that would expand coverage beyond just
legal expenses to acts, such as negligence, that are more serious violations of
fiduciary obligation than mere carelessness.

Vote FOR only those proposals providing such expanded coverage in cases when a
director's or officer's legal defense was unsuccessful if both of the following
apply:

      o     The director was found to have acted in good faith and in a manner
            that he reasonably believed was in the best interests of the

      o     If only the director's legal expenses would be covered.

vacancies.

INDEPENDENT CHAIR (SEPARATE CHAIR/CEO)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requiring the position of chair be
filled by an independent director unless there are compelling reasons to
recommend against the proposal, such as a counterbalancing governance structure.
This should include all of the following:

      o     Designated lead director, elected by and from the independent board
            members with clearly delineated and comprehensive duties. (The role
            may alternatively reside with a presiding director, vice chairman,
            or rotating lead director; however the director must serve a minimum
            of one year in order to qualify as a lead director.) At a minimum
            these should include:

            -     Presides at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is
                  not present, including executive sessions of the independent
                  directors,

            -     Serves as liaison between the chairman and the independent
                  directors,

================================================================================

            -     Has the authority to call meetings of the independent
                  directors,

            -     If requested by major shareholders, ensures that he is
                  available for consultation and direct communication;

      o     Two-thirds independent board;

      o     All-independent key committees;

      o     Established governance guidelines;

      o     The company does not under-perform its peers.

MAJORITY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS/ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMITTEES

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that a majority or more of directors be
independent unless the board composition already meets the proposed threshold by
ISS's definition of independence.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals asking that board audit, compensation, and/or
nominating committees be composed exclusively of independent directors if they
currently do not meet that standard.

MAJORITY VOTE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS

Generally vote FOR reasonably crafted shareholders proposals calling for
directors to be elected with an affirmative majority of votes cast and/or the
elimination of the plurality standard for electing directors (including binding
resolutions requesting that the board amend the company's bylaws), provided the
proposal includes a carve-out for a plurality voting standard when there are
more director nominees than board seats (e.g. contested elections).

Consider voting AGAINST the shareholder proposal if the company has adopted
formal corporate governance principles that present a meaningful alternative to
the majority voting standard and provide an adequate response to both new
nominees as well as incumbent nominees who fail to receive a majority of votes
cast.

Policies should address the specific circumstances at each company. At a
minimum, a company's policy should articulate the following elements to
adequately address each director nominee who fails to receive an affirmative of
majority of votes cast in an election:

      o     Established guidelines disclosed annually in the proxy statement
            concerning the process to follow for nominees who receive majority
            withhold votes;

      o     The policy needs to outline a clear and reasonable timetable for all
            decision-making regarding the nominee's status;

      o     The policy needs to specify that the process of determining the
            nominee's status will be managed by independent directors and must
            exclude the nominee in question;

      o     An outline of a range of remedies that can be considered concerning
            the nominee needs to be in the policy (for example, acceptance of
            the resignation, maintaining the director but curing the underlying
            causes of the withheld votes, etc.);

      o     The final decision on the nominee's status should be promptly
            disclosed via an SEC filing. The policy needs to include the
            timeframe in which the decision will be disclosed and a full
            explanation of how the decision was reached.

In addition, the company should articulate to shareholders why this alternative
to a full majority threshold voting standard is the best structure at this time
for demonstrating accountability to shareholders. Also evaluate the company's
history of accountability to shareholders in its governance structure and in its
actions. In particular, a classified board structure or a history of ignoring
majority supported shareholder proposals will be considered at a company which
receives a shareholder proposal requesting the elimination of plurality voting
in favor of majority threshold for electing directors.

================================================================================

OFFICE OF THE BOARD

Generally vote FOR shareholders proposals requesting that the board establish an
Office of the Board of Directors in order to facilitate direct communications
between shareholders and non-management directors, unless the company has all of
the following:

      o     Established a communication structure that goes beyond the exchange
            requirements to facilitate the exchange of information between
            shareholders and members of the board;

      o     Effectively disclosed information with respect to this structure to
            its shareholders;

      o     Company has not ignored majority supported shareholder proposals or
            a majority WITHHOLD on a director nominee; and

      o     The company has an independent chairman or a lead/presiding
            director, according to ISS' definition. This individual must be made
            available for periodic consultation and direct communication with
            major shareholders.

OPEN ACCESS

Generally vote FOR reasonably crafted shareholder proposals providing
shareholders with the ability to nominate director candidates to be included on
management's proxy card, provided the proposal substantially mirrors the SEC's
proposed two-trigger formulation (see the proposed "Security Holder Director
Nominations" rule (HTTP://WWW.SEC.GOV/RULES/PROPOSED/34-48626.HTM) or ISS'
comment letter to the SEC dated 6/13/2003, available on ISS website under
Governance Center- ISS Position Papers).

STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS

Generally vote AGAINST shareholder proposals that mandate a minimum amount of
stock that directors must own in order to qualify as a director or to remain on
the board. While stock ownership on the part of directors is desired, the
company should determine the appropriate ownership requirement.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals asking that the company adopt a
holding or retention period for its executives (for holding stock after the
vesting or exercise of equity awards), taking into account any stock ownership
requirements or holding period/retention ratio already in place and the actual
ownership level of executives.

TERM LIMITS

Vote AGAINST shareholder or management proposals to limit the tenure of outside
directors through term limits. However, scrutinize boards where the average
tenure of all directors exceeds 15 years for independence from management and
for sufficient turnover to ensure that new perspectives are being added to the
board.

3. PROXY CONTESTS

VOTING FOR DIRECTOR NOMINEES IN CONTESTED ELECTIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on the election of directors in contested elections,
considering the following factors:

      o     Long-term financial performance of the target company relative to
            its industry;

      o     Management's track record;

      o     Background to the proxy contest;

      o     Qualifications of director nominees (both slates);

      o     Strategic plan of dissident slate and quality of critique against
            management;

      o     Likelihood that the proposed goals and objectives can be achieved
            (both slates);

      o     Stock ownership positions.

REIMBURSING PROXY SOLICITATION EXPENSES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to reimburse proxy solicitation expenses. When
voting in conjunction with support of a dissident slate, vote FOR the
reimbursement of all appropriate proxy solicitation expenses associated with the
election.

CONFIDENTIAL VOTING

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that corporations adopt confidential
voting, use independent vote tabulators, and use independent inspectors of
election, as long as the proposal includes a provision for proxy contests as
follows: In the case of a contested election, management should be permitted to
request that the dissident group honor its confidential voting policy. If the
dissidents agree, the policy remains in place. If the dissidents will not agree,
the confidential voting policy is waived.

Vote FOR management proposals to adopt confidential voting.

4. ANTITAKEOVER DEFENSES AND VOTING RELATED ISSUES

ADVANCE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS/NOMINATIONS

Votes on advance notice proposals are determined on a CASE-BY-CASE basis, giving
support to those proposals which allow shareholders to submit proposals as close
to the meeting date as reasonably possible and within the broadest window
possible.

AMEND BYLAWS WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals giving the board exclusive authority to amend the bylaws.

Vote FOR proposals giving the board the ability to amend the bylaws in addition
to shareholders.

POISON PILLS

Vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting that the company submit its poison
pill to a shareholder vote or redeem it UNLESS the company has: (1) A
shareholder approved poison pill in place; or (2) The company has adopted a
policy concerning the adoption of a pill in the future specifying that the board
will only adopt a shareholder rights plan if either:

      o     Shareholders have approved the adoption of the plan; or

      o     The board, in its exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities,
            determines that it is in the best interest of shareholders under the
            circumstances to adopt a pill without the delay in adoption that
            would result from seeking stockholder approval (i.e. the "fiduciary
            out" provision). A poison pill adopted under this fiduciary out will
            be put to a shareholder ratification vote within twelve months of
            adoption or expire. If the pill is not approved by a majority of the
            votes cast on this issue, the plan will immediately terminate.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals calling for poison pills to be put to a vote
within a time period of less than one year after adoption. If the company has no
non-shareholder approved poison pill in place and has adopted a policy with the
provisions outlined above, vote AGAINST the proposal. If these conditions are
not met, vote FOR the proposal, but with the caveat that a vote within twelve
months would be considered sufficient.

Vote CASE-by-CASE on management proposals on poison pill ratification, focusing
on the features of the shareholder rights plan. Rights plans should contain the
following attributes:

      o     No lower than a 20% trigger, flip-in or flip-over;

      o     A term of no more than three years;

      o     No dead-hand, slow-hand, no-hand or similar feature that limits the
            ability of a future board to redeem the pill;

      o     Shareholder redemption feature (qualifying offer clause); if the
            board refuses to redeem the pill 90 days after a qualifying offer is
            announced, ten percent of the shares may call a special meeting or
            seek a written consent to vote on rescinding the pill.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT

Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to take
action by written consent.

Vote FOR proposals to allow or make easier shareholder action by written
consent.

SHAREHOLDER ABILITY TO CALL SPECIAL MEETINGS

Vote AGAINST proposals to restrict or prohibit shareholder ability to call
special meetings.

Vote FOR proposals that remove restrictions on the right of shareholders to act
independently of management.

SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

Vote AGAINST proposals to require a supermajority shareholder vote.

Vote FOR proposals to lower supermajority vote requirements.

5. MERGERS AND CORPORATE RESTRUCTURINGS
   OVERALL APPROACH

For mergers and acquisitions, review and evaluate the merits and drawbacks of
the proposed transaction, balancing various and sometimes countervailing factors
including:

      o     VALUATION - Is the value to be received by the target shareholders
            (or paid by the acquirer) reasonable? While the fairness opinion may
            provide an initial starting point for assessing valuation
            reasonableness, emphasis is placed on the offer premium, market
            reaction and strategic rationale.

      o     MARKET REACTION - How has the market responded to the proposed deal?
            A negative market reaction should cause closer scrutiny of a deal.

      o     STRATEGIC RATIONALE - Does the deal make sense strategically? From
            where is the value derived? Cost and revenue synergies should not be
            overly aggressive or optimistic, but reasonably achievable.
            Management should also have a favorable track record of successful
            integration of historical acquisitions.

      o     NEGOTIATIONS AND PROCESS - Were the terms of the transaction
            negotiated at arm's-length? Was the process fair and equitable? A
            fair process helps to ensure the best price for shareholders.
            Significant negotiation "wins" can also signify the deal makers'
            competency. The comprehensiveness of the sales process (e.g., full
            auction, partial auction, no auction) can also affect shareholder
            value.

      o     CONFLICTS OF INTEREST - Are insiders benefiting from the transaction
            disproportionately and inappropriately as compared to non-insider
            shareholders? As the result of potential conflicts, the directors
            and officers of the company may be more likely to vote to approve a
            merger than if they did not hold these interests. Consider whether
            these interests may have influenced these directors and officers to
            support or recommend the merger. The CIC figure presented in the
            "ISS Transaction Summary" section of this report is an aggregate
            figure that can in certain cases be a misleading indicator of the
            true value transfer from shareholders to insiders. Where such figure
            appears to be excessive, analyze the underlying assumptions to
            determine whether a potential conflict exists.

      o     GOVERNANCE - Will the combined company have a better or worse
            governance profile than the current governance profiles of the
            respective parties to the transaction? If the governance profile is
            to change for the worse, the burden is on the company to prove that
            other issues (such as valuation) outweigh any deterioration in
            governance.

APPRAISAL RIGHTS

Vote FOR proposals to restore, or provide shareholders with, rights of
appraisal.

ASSET PURCHASES

      o     How the deal was negotiated;

      o     Conflicts of interest;

      o     Other alternatives for the business;

the packaged items. In instances when the joint effect of the conditioned items
is not in shareholders' best interests, vote AGAINST the proposals. If the
combined effect is positive, support such proposals.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals regarding conversion of securities. When
evaluating these proposals the investor should review the dilution to existing
shareholders, the conversion price relative to market value, financial issues,
control issues, termination penalties, and conflicts of interest.

onerous penalties or will be forced to file for bankruptcy if the transaction is
not approved.

      o     Changes to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the company.

      Absent compelling financial reasons to recommend the transaction, vote
      AGAINST the formation of a holding company if the transaction would
      include either of the following:

================================================================================

<PAGE>

================================================================================

      o     Increases in common or preferred stock in excess of the allowable
            maximum (see discussion under "Capital Structure");

following: offer price/premium, fairness opinion, how the deal was negotiated,
conflicts of interest, other alternatives/offers considered, and non-completion
risk.

transaction enhances shareholder value by taking into consideration:

      o     Whether the company has attained benefits from being publicly-traded
            (examination of trading volume, liquidity, and market research of
            the stock);

      o     Cash-out value;

      o     Whether the interests of continuing and cashed-out shareholders are
            balanced; and

      o     The market reaction to public announcement of transaction.

      o     Percentage ownership;

      o     Financial and strategic benefits;

      o     Governance structure;

      o     Conflicts of interest;

      o     Other alternatives;

      o     Noncompletion risk.

      o     Management's efforts to pursue other alternatives;

      o     Appraisal value of assets; and

      o     The compensation plan for executives managing the liquidation.

Vote FOR the liquidation if the company will file for bankruptcy if the proposal
is not approved.

Vote FOR the private placement if it is expected that the company will file for
bankruptcy if the transaction is not approved.

SPINOFFS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on spin-offs, considering:

      o     Tax and regulatory advantages;

      o     Planned use of the sale proceeds;

      o     Valuation of spinoff;

      o     Fairness opinion;

by hiring a financial advisor to explore strategic alternatives, selling the
company or liquidating the company and distributing the proceeds to
shareholders. These proposals should be evaluated based on the following
factors:

      o     Prolonged poor performance with no turnaround in sight;

      o     Signs of entrenched board and management;

      o     Strategic plan in place for improving value;

      o     Likelihood of receiving reasonable value in a sale or dissolution;

6. STATE OF INCORPORATION

CONTROL SHARE ACQUISITION PROVISIONS

Control share acquisition statutes function by denying shares their voting
rights when they contribute to ownership in excess of certain thresholds. Voting
rights for those shares exceeding ownership limits may only be restored by
approval of either a majority or supermajority of disinterested shares. Thus,
control share acquisition statutes effectively require a hostile bidder to put
its offer to a shareholder vote or risk voting disenfranchisement if the bidder
continues buying up a large block of shares.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share acquisition statutes unless doing
so would enable the completion of a takeover that would be detrimental to
shareholders.

Vote AGAINST proposals to amend the charter to include control share acquisition
provisions.

Vote FOR proposals to restore voting rights to the control shares.

CONTROL SHARE CASH-OUT PROVISIONS

Control share cash-out statutes give dissident shareholders the right to
"cash-out" of their position in a company at the expense of the shareholder who
has taken a control position. In other words, when an investor crosses a preset
threshold level, remaining shareholders are given the right to sell their shares
to the acquirer, who must buy them at the highest acquiring price.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of control share cash-out statutes.

DISGORGEMENT PROVISIONS

Disgorgement provisions require an acquirer or potential acquirer of more than a
certain percentage of a company's stock to disgorge, or pay back, to the company
any profits realized from the sale of that company's stock purchased 24 months
before achieving control status. All sales of company stock by the acquirer
occurring within a certain period of time (between 18 months and 24 months)
prior to the investor's gaining control status are subject to these
recapture-of-profits provisions.

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of state disgorgement provisions.

FAIR PRICE PROVISIONS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to adopt fair price provisions (provisions that
stipulate that an acquirer must pay the same price to acquire all shares as it
paid to acquire the control shares), evaluating factors such as the vote
required to approve the proposed acquisition, the vote required to repeal the
fair price provision, and the mechanism for determining the fair price.

Generally, vote AGAINST fair price provisions with shareholder vote requirements
greater than a majority of disinterested shares.

FREEZE-OUT PROVISIONS

Vote FOR proposals to opt out of state freeze-out provisions. Freeze-out
provisions force an investor who surpasses a certain ownership threshold in a
company to wait a specified period of time before gaining control of the
company.

GREENMAIL

Greenmail payments are targeted share repurchases by management of company stock
from individuals or groups seeking control of the company. Since only the
hostile party receives

================================================================================

<PAGE>

================================================================================

payment, usually at a substantial premium over the market value of its shares,
the practice discriminates against all other shareholders.

Vote FOR proposals to adopt anti-greenmail charter or bylaw amendments or
otherwise restrict a company's ability to make greenmail payments.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on anti-greenmail proposals when they are bundled with other
charter or bylaw amendments.

REINCORPORATION PROPOSALS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to change a company's state of incorporation,
taking into consideration both financial and corporate governance concerns,
including the reasons for reincorporating, a comparison of the governance
provisions, comparative economic benefits, and a comparison of the
jurisdictional laws.

Vote FOR re-incorporation when the economic factors outweigh any neutral or
negative governance changes.

STAKEHOLDER PROVISIONS

Vote AGAINST proposals that ask the board to consider non-shareholder
constituencies or other non-financial effects when evaluating a merger or
business combination.

STATE ANTITAKEOVER STATUTES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to opt in or out of state takeover statutes
(including control share acquisition statutes, control share cash-out statutes,
freezeout provisions, fair price provisions, stakeholder laws, poison pill
endorsements, severance pay and labor contract provisions, anti-greenmail
provisions, and disgorgement provisions).

7. CAPITAL STRUCTURE

ADJUSTMENTS TO PAR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK

Vote FOR management proposals to reduce the par value of common stock.

COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZATION

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of shares of common stock
authorized for issuance using a model developed by ISS.

Vote FOR proposals to approve increases beyond the allowable increase when a
company's shares are in danger of being delisted or if a company's ability to
continue to operate as a going concern is uncertain.

In addition, for capital requests less than or equal to 300 percent of the
current authorized shares that marginally fail the calculated allowable cap
(i.e., exceed the allowable cap by no more than 5 percent), on a CASE-BY-CASE
basis, vote FOR the increase based on the company's performance and whether the
company's ongoing use of shares has shown prudence. Factors should include, at a
minimum, the following:

      o     Rationale;

      o     Good performance with respect to peers and index on a five-year
            total shareholder return basis;

      o     Absence of non-shareholder approved poison pill;

      o     Reasonable equity compensation burn rate;

      o     No non-shareholder approved pay plans; and

      o     Absence of egregious equity compensation practices.

DUAL-CLASS STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals to create a new class of common stock with superior
voting rights.

Vote AGAINST proposals at companies with dual-class capital structures to
increase the number of authorized shares of the class of stock that has superior
voting rights.

Vote FOR proposals to create a new class of nonvoting or sub-voting common stock
if:

      o     It is intended for financing purposes with minimal or no dilution to
            current shareholders;

      o     It is not designed to preserve the voting power of an insider or
            significant shareholder.

ISSUE STOCK FOR USE WITH RIGHTS PLAN

Vote AGAINST proposals that increase authorized common stock for the explicit
purpose of implementing a non-shareholder approved shareholder rights plan
(poison pill).

PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on shareholder proposals that seek preemptive rights, taking
into consideration: the size of a company, the characteristics of its
shareholder base, and the liquidity of the stock.

PREFERRED STOCK

Vote AGAINST proposals authorizing the creation of new classes of preferred
stock with unspecified voting, conversion, dividend distribution, and other
rights ("blank check" preferred stock).

================================================================================

(C) 2005 Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. All Rights Reserved.         22

================================================================================

Vote FOR proposals to create "declawed" blank check preferred stock (stock that
cannot be used as a takeover defense).

Vote FOR proposals to authorize preferred stock in cases where the company
specifies the voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights of such stock and
the terms of the preferred stock appear reasonable.

Vote AGAINST proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred stock
authorized for issuance when no shares have been issued or reserved for a
specific purpose.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to increase the number of blank check preferred
shares after analyzing the number of preferred shares available for issue given
a company's industry and performance in terms of shareholder returns.

RECAPITALIZATION

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on recapitalizations (reclassifications of securities), taking
into account the following:

      o     More simplified capital structure;

      o     Enhanced liquidity;

      o     Fairness of conversion terms;

      o     Impact on voting power and dividends;

      o     Conflicts of interest; and

      o     Other alternatives considered.

REVERSE STOCK SPLITS

Vote FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split when the number
of authorized shares will be proportionately reduced.

Vote FOR management proposals to implement a reverse stock split to avoid
delisting.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to implement a reverse stock split that do not
proportionately reduce the number of shares authorized for issue based on the
allowable increased calculated using the Capital Structure model.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS

Vote FOR management proposals to institute open-market share repurchase plans in
which all shareholders may participate on equal terms.

STOCK DISTRIBUTIONS: SPLITS AND DIVIDENDS

Vote FOR management proposals to increase the common share authorization for a
stock split or share dividend, provided that the increase in authorized shares
would not result in an excessive number of shares available for issuance as
determined using a model developed by ISS.

TRACKING STOCK

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on the creation of tracking stock, weighing the strategic
value of the transaction against such factors as:

      o     Adverse governance changes;

      o     Excessive increases in authorized capital stock;

      o     Unfair method of distribution;

      o     Diminution of voting rights;

      o     Adverse conversion features;

      o     Negative impact on stock option plans; and

      o     Alternatives such as spin-off.

8. EXECUTIVE AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on equity-based compensation plans. Vote AGAINST the equity
plan if any of the following factors apply:

      o     The total cost of the company's equity plans is unreasonable;

      o     The plan expressly permits the repricing of stock options without
            prior shareholder approval;

      o     There is a disconnect between CEO pay and the company's performance;

      o     The company's three year burn rate exceeds the greater of 2% and the
            mean plus 1 standard deviation of its industry group; or

      o     The plan is a vehicle for poor pay practices.

Each of these factors is further described below:

COST OF EQUITY PLANS

Generally, vote AGAINST equity plans if the cost is unreasonable. For
non-employee director plans, vote FOR the plan if certain factors are met (see
Director Compensation section).

The cost of the equity plans is expressed as Shareholder Value Transfer (SVT),
which is measured using a binomial option pricing model that assesses the amount
of shareholders' equity flowing out of the company to employees and directors.
SVT is expressed as both a dollar amount and as a percentage of market value,
and includes the new shares proposed, shares available under existing plans, and
shares granted but unexercised. All award types are valued. For omnibus plans,
unless limitations are placed on the most expensive types of awards (for
example, full value awards), the assumption is made that all awards to be
granted will be the most expensive types. See discussion of specific types of
awards.

The Shareholder Value Transfer is reasonable if it falls below the
company-specific allowable cap. The allowable cap is determined as follows: The
top quartile performers in each industry group (using the Global Industry
Classification Standard GICS) are identified. Benchmark SVT levels for each
industry are established based on these top performers' historic SVT. Regression
analyses are run on each industry group to identify the variables most strongly
correlated to SVT. The benchmark industry SVT level is then adjusted upwards or
downwards for the specific company by plugging the company-specific performance
measures, size and cash compensation into the industry cap equations to arrive
at the company's allowable cap.

REPRICING PROVISIONS

Vote AGAINST plans that expressly permit the repricing of stock options without
prior shareholder approval, even if the cost of the plan is reasonable.

Vote AGAINST plans if the company has a history of repricing options without
shareholder approval, and the applicable listing standards would not preclude
them from doing so.

PAY-FOR PERFORMANCE DISCONNECT

Generally vote AGAINST plans in which:

      o     there is a disconnect between the CEO's pay and company performance
            (an increase in pay and a decrease in performance);

      o     the main source of the pay increase (over half) is equity-based, and

      o     the CEO is a participant of the equity proposal.

================================================================================

(C) 2005 Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. All Rights Reserved.         24

<PAGE>

================================================================================

Performance decreases are based on negative one- and three-year total
shareholder returns. CEO pay increases are based on the CEO's total direct
compensation (salary, cash bonus, present value of stock options, face value of
restricted stock, face value of long-term incentive plan payouts, and all other
compensation) increasing over the previous year.

WITHHOLD votes from the Compensation Committee members when the company has a
pay for performance disconnect.

On a CASE-BY-CASE basis, vote for equity plans and FOR compensation committee
members with a pay-for-performance disconnect if compensation committee members
can present strong and compelling evidence of improved committee performance.
This evidence must go beyond the usual compensation committee report disclosure.
This additional evidence necessary includes all of the following:

      o     The compensation committee has reviewed all components of the CEO's
            compensation, including the following:

                  -     Base salary, bonus, long-term incentives;

                  -     Accumulative realized and unrealized stock option and
                        restricted stock gains;

                  -     Dollar value of perquisites and other personal benefits
                        to the CEO and the total cost to the company;

                  -     Earnings and accumulated payment obligations under the
                        company's nonqualified deferred compensation program;

                  -     Actual projected payment obligations under the company's
                        supplemental executive retirement plan (SERPs).

A tally sheet setting forth all the above components was prepared and reviewed
affixing dollar amounts under the various payout scenarios. (A complete
breakdown of pay components also can be found in Disclosure of CEO Compensation
- - Tally Sheet.)

      o     A tally sheet with all the above components should be disclosed for
            the following termination scenarios:

                  -     Payment if termination occurs within 12 months: $_____;

                  -     Payment if "not for cause" termination occurs within 12
                        months: $_____;

                  -     Payment if "change of control" termination occurs within
                        12 months: $_____.

      o     The compensation committee is committed to providing additional
            information on the named executives' annual cash bonus program
            and/or long-term incentive cash plan for the current fiscal year.
            The compensation committee will provide full disclosure of the
            qualitative and quantitative performance criteria and hurdle rates
            used to determine the payouts of the cash program. From this
            disclosure, shareholders will know the minimum level of performance
            required for any cash bonus to be delivered, as well as the maximum
            cash bonus payable for superior performance.

The repetition of the compensation committee report does not meet ISS'
requirement of compelling and strong evidence of improved disclosure. The level
of transparency and disclosure is at the highest level where shareholders can
understand the mechanics of the annual cash bonus and/or long-term incentive
cash plan based on the additional disclosure.

      o     The compensation committee is committed to granting a substantial
            portion of performance-based equity awards to the named executive
            officers. A substantial portion of performance-based awards would be
            at least 50 percent of the shares awarded to each of the named
            executive officers. Performance-based equity awards are earned or
            paid out based on the achievement of company performance targets.
            The company will disclose the details of the performance criteria
            (e.g., return on equity) and the hurdle

            rates (e.g., 15 percent) associated with the performance targets.
            From this disclosure, shareholders will know the minimum level of
            performance required for any equity grants to be made. The
            performance-based equity awards do not refer to non-qualified stock
            options 1 or performance-accelerated grants. 2 Instead,
            performance-based equity awards are performance-contingent grants
            where the individual will not receive the equity grant by not
            meeting the target performance and vice versa.

The level of transparency and disclosure is at the highest level where
shareholders can understand the mechanics of the performance-based equity awards
based on the additional disclosure.

      o     The compensation committee has the sole authority to hire and fire
            outside compensation consultants. The role of the outside
            compensation consultant is to assist the compensation committee to
            analyze executive pay packages or contracts and understand the
            company's financial measures.

THREE-YEAR BURN RATE/BURN RATE COMMITMENT

Generally vote AGAINST plans if the company's most recent three-year burn rate
exceeds one standard deviation in excess of the industry mean (per the following
Burn Rate Table) and is over two percent of common shares outstanding. The
three-year burn rate policy does not apply to non-employee director plans unless
outside directors receive a significant portion of shares each year.

However, vote FOR equity plans if the company fails this burn rate test but the
company commits in a public filing to a three-year average burn rate equal to
its GICS group burn rate mean plus one standard deviation, assuming all other
conditions for voting FOR the plan have been met. If a company fails to fulfill
its burn rate commitment, vote to WITHHOLD from the compensation committee.

- ----------
1     Non-qualified stock options are not performance-based awards unless the
      grant or the vesting of the stock options is tied to the achievement of a
      pre-determined and disclosed performance measure. A rising stock market
      will generally increase share prices of all companies, despite of the
      company's underlying performance.

2     Performance-accelerated grants are awards that vest earlier based on the
      achievement of a specified measure. However, these grants will ultimately
      vest over time even without the attainment of the goal(s).

POOR PAY PRACTICES

Vote AGAINST equity plans if the plan is a vehicle for poor compensation
practices.

WITHOLD from compensation committee members if the company has poor compensation
practices.

Poor compensation practices include, but are not limited to, the following:

      o     Egregious employment contracts including excessive severance
            provisions;

      o     Excessive perks that dominate compensation;

      o     Huge bonus payouts without justifiable performance linkage;

      o     Performance metrics that are changed during the performance period;

      o     Egregious SERP (Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans) payouts;

      o     New CEO with overly generous hiring package;

================================================================================

      o     Internal pay disparity;

      o     Other excessive compensation payouts or poor pay practices at the
            company.

SPECIFIC TREATMENT OF CERTAIN AWARD TYPES IN EQUITY PLAN EVALUATIONS:

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT RIGHTS

Equity plans that have Dividend Equivalent Rights (DERs) associated with them
will have a higher calculated award value than those without DERs under the
binomial model, based on the value of these dividend streams. The higher value
will be applied to new shares, shares available under existing plans, and shares
awarded but not exercised per the plan specifications. DERS transfer more
shareholder equity to employees and non-employee directors and this cost should
be captured.

LIBERAL SHARE RECYCLING PROVISIONS

Under net share counting provisions, shares tendered by an option holder to pay
for the exercise of an option, shares withheld for taxes or shares repurchased
by the company on the open market can be recycled back into the equity plan for
awarding again. All awards with such provisions should be valued as full-value
awards. Stock-settled stock appreciation rights (SSARs) will also be considered
as full-value awards if a company counts only the net shares issued to employees
towards their plan reserve.

TRANSFERABLE STOCK OPTION AWARDS

For transferable stock option award types within a new equity plan, calculate
the cost of the awards by setting their forfeiture rate to zero when comparing
to the allowable cap. In addition, in order to vote FOR plans with such awards,
the structure and mechanics of the ongoing transferable stock option program
must be disclosed to shareholders; and amendments to existing plans that allow
for introduction of transferability of stock options should make clear that only
options granted post-amendment shall be transferable.

OTHER COMPENSATION PROPOSALS AND POLICIES

401(K) EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Vote FOR proposals to implement a 401(k) savings plan for employees.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on compensation plans for non-employee directors, based on the
cost of the plans against the company's allowable cap.

On occasion, director stock plans that set aside a relatively small number of
shares when combined with employee or executive stock compensation plans exceed
the allowable cap. Vote for the plan if ALL of the following qualitative factors
in the board's compensation are met and disclosed in the proxy statement:

      o     Director stock ownership guidelines with a minimum of three times
            the annual cash retainer.

      o     Vesting schedule or mandatory holding/deferral period:

            -     A minimum vesting of three years for stock options or
                  restricted stock; or

            -     Deferred stock payable at the end of a three-year deferral
                  period.

      o     Mix between cash and equity:

            -     A balanced mix of cash and equity, for example 40% cash/60%
                  equity or 50% cash/50% equity; or

================================================================================

(C) 2005 Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. All Rights Reserved.         28

<PAGE>

================================================================================

            -     If the mix is heavier on the equity component, the vesting
                  schedule or deferral period should be more stringent, with the
                  lesser of five years or the term of directorship.

      o     No retirement/benefits and perquisites provided to non-employee
            directors; and

      o     Detailed disclosure provided on cash and equity compensation
            delivered to each non- employee director for the most recent fiscal
            year in a table. The column headers for the table may include the
            following: name of each non-employee director, annual retainer,
            board meeting fees, committee retainer, committee-meeting fees, and
            equity grants.

DIRECTOR RETIREMENT PLANS

Vote AGAINST retirement plans for non-employee directors.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to eliminate retirement plans for non-employee
directors.

DISCLOSURE OF CEO COMPENSATION-TALLY SHEET

Encourage companies to provide better and more transparent disclosure related to
CEO pay. Consider withhold votes in the future from the compensation committee
and voting against equity plans if compensation disclosure is not improved and a
tally sheet is not provided.

In addition to the current SEC requirements, the following table sets forth the
current minimum standard on CEO pay disclosure according to ISS's guidelines:

existing ESOPs, unless the number of shares allocated to the ESOP is excessive
(more than five percent of outstanding shares).

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS-- QUALIFIED PLANS

stock purchase plans where all of the following apply:

      o     Purchase price is at least 85 percent of fair market value;

      o     Offering period is 27 months or less; and

      o     The number of shares allocated to the plan is ten percent or less of

Vote AGAINST qualified employee stock purchase plans where any of the following
apply:

      o     Purchase price is less than 85 percent of fair market value; or

      o     Offering period is greater than 27 months; or

            of the outstanding shares.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS-- NON-QUALIFIED PLANS

Vote CASE-by-CASE on nonqualified employee stock purchase plans. Vote FOR
nonqualified employee stock purchase plans with all the following features:

      o     Broad-based participation (i.e., all employees of the company with
            the exclusion of individuals with 5 percent or more of beneficial
            ownership of the company);

      o     Limits on employee contribution, which may be a fixed dollar amount
            or expressed as a percent of base salary;

      o     Company matching contribution up to 25 percent of employee's
            contribution, which is effectively a discount of 20 percent from
            market value;

      o     No discount on the stock price on the date of purchase since there
            is a company matching contribution.

Vote AGAINST nonqualified employee stock purchase plans when any of the plan
features do not meet the above criteria. If the company matching contribution
exceeds 25 percent of employee's contribution, evaluate the cost of the plan
against its allowable cap.

INCENTIVE BONUS PLANS AND TAX DEDUCTIBILITY PROPOSALS (OBRA-RELATED COMPENSATION
PROPOSALS)

Vote FOR proposals that simply amend shareholder-approved compensation plans to
include administrative features or place a cap on the annual grants any one
participant may receive to comply with the provisions of Section 162(m).

Vote FOR proposals to add performance goals to existing compensation plans to
comply with the provisions of Section 162(m) unless they are clearly
inappropriate.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on amendments to existing plans to increase shares reserved
and to qualify for favorable tax treatment under the provisions of Section
162(m) as long as the plan does not exceed the allowable cap and the plan does
not violate any of the supplemental policies.

Generally vote FOR cash or cash and stock bonus plans that are submitted to
shareholders for the purpose of exempting compensation from taxes under the
provisions of Section 162(m) if no increase in shares is requested.

options taking into consideration:

      o     Historic trading patterns;

      o     Treatment of surrendered options;

      o     Option vesting;

      o     Term of the option;

      o     Exercise price;

================================================================================

If the surrendered options are added back to the equity plans for re-issuance,
then also take into consideration the company's three-year average burn rate.

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to put option repricings to a shareholder vote.

STOCK PLANS IN LIEU OF CASH

Vote CASE-by-CASE on plans which provide participants with the option of taking
all or a portion of their cash compensation in the form of stock.

Vote FOR non-employee director only equity plans which provide a
dollar-for-dollar cash for stock exchange.

Vote CASE-by-CASE on plans which do not provide a dollar-for-dollar cash for
stock exchange. In cases where the exchange is not dollar-for-dollar, the
request for new or additional shares for such equity program will be considered
using the binomial option pricing model. In an effort to capture the total cost
of total compensation, ISS will not make any adjustments to carve out the
in-lieu-of cash compensation.

TRANSFER PROGRAMS OF STOCK OPTIONS

One-time Transfers: WITHHOLD votes from compensation committee members if they
fail to submit one-time transfers for to shareholders for approval.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on one-time transfers. Vote FOR if:

      o     Executive officers and non-employee directors are excluded from
            participating;

            a discount to their fair value using option pricing models such as
            Black-Scholes or a Binomial Option Valuation or other appropriate
            financial models;

      o     There is a two-year minimum holding period for sale proceeds (cash
            or stock) for all participants.

Additionally, management should provide a clear explanation of why options are
being transferred and whether the events leading up to the decline in stock
price were beyond management's control. A review of the company's historic stock
price volatility should indicate if the options are likely to be back
"in-the-money" over the near term.

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS ON COMPENSATION

DISCLOSURE/SETTING LEVELS OR TYPES OF COMPENSATION FOR EXECUTIVES AND DIRECTORS

Generally, vote FOR shareholder proposals seeking additional disclosure of
executive and director pay information, provided the information requested is
relevant to shareholders' needs, would not put the company at a competitive
disadvantage relative to its industry, and is not unduly burdensome to the
company.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals seeking to set absolute levels on
compensation or otherwise dictate the amount or form of compensation.

Vote AGAINST shareholder proposals requiring director fees be paid in stock
only.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on all other shareholder proposals regarding executive and
director pay, taking into account company performance, pay level versus peers,
pay level versus industry, and long term corporate outlook.

PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals advocating the use of performance-based
awards like indexed, premium-priced, and performance-vested options or
performance-based shares, unless:

      o     The proposal is overly restrictive (e.g., it mandates that awards to
            all employees must be performance-based or all awards to top
            executives must be a particular type, such as indexed options);

      o     The company demonstrates that it is using a substantial portion of
            performance-based awards for its top executives, where substantial
            portion would constitute 50 percent of the shares awarded to those
            executives for that fiscal year.

SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS FOR EXECUTIVES/GOLDEN PARACHUTES

Vote FOR shareholder proposals to require golden parachutes or executive
severance agreements to be submitted for shareholder ratification, unless the
proposal requires shareholder approval prior to entering into employment
contracts.

An acceptable parachute should include, but is not limited to, the following:

      o     The triggering mechanism should be beyond the control of management;

            average annual taxable W-2 compensation during the five years prior
            to the year in which the change of control occurs;

      o     Change-in-control payments should be double-triggered, i.e., (1)
            after a change in control has taken place, and (2) termination of
            the executive as a result of the change in control. Change in
            control is defined as a change in the company ownership structure.

SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLANS (SERPS)

Generally vote FOR shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary
benefits contained in SERP agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company's
executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered

9. CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

CONSUMER ISSUES AND PUBLIC SAFETY

ANIMAL RIGHTS

Generally vote AGAINST proposals to phase out the use of animals in product
testing unless:

      o     The company is conducting animal testing programs that are
            unnecessary or not required by regulation;

      o     The company is conducting animal testing when suitable alternatives
            are accepted and used at peer firms;

      o     The company has been the subject of recent, significant controversy
            related to its testing programs.

Generally vote FOR proposals seeking a report on the company's animal welfare
standards unless:

      o     The company has already published a set of animal welfare standards
            and monitors compliance;

      o     The company's standards are comparable to or better than those of
            peer firms; and

      o     There are no serious controversies surrounding the company's
            treatment of animals.

DRUG PRICING

Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting that companies implement specific
price restraints on pharmaceutical products unless the company fails to adhere
to legislative guidelines or industry norms in its product pricing.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals requesting that the company evaluate their
product pricing considering:

      o     The existing level of disclosure on pricing policies;

      o     Deviation from established industry pricing norms;

      o     The company's existing initiatives to provide its products to needy
            consumers;

      o     Whether the proposal focuses on specific products or geographic
            regions.

DRUG REIMPORTATION

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting that companies report on the financial
and legal impact of their policies regarding prescription drug reimportation
unless such information is already publicly disclosed.

Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting that companies adopt specific
policies to encourage or constrain prescription drug reimportation.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS

Vote AGAINST proposals asking companies to voluntarily label genetically
engineered (GE) ingredients in their products or alternatively to provide
interim labeling and eventually eliminate GE ingredients due to the costs and
feasibility of labeling and/or phasing out the use of GE ingredients.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking for a report on the feasibility of
labeling products containing GE ingredients taking into account:

      o     The relevance of the proposal in terms of the company's business and
            the proportion of it affected by the resolution;

================================================================================

(C) 2005 Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. All Rights Reserved.         34

<PAGE>

================================================================================

      o     The quality of the company's disclosure on GE product labeling and
            related voluntary initiatives and how this disclosure compares with
            peer company disclosure;

      o     Company's current disclosure on the feasibility of GE product
            labeling, including information on the related costs;

      o     Any voluntary labeling initiatives undertaken or considered by the
            company.

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals asking for the preparation of a report on the
financial, legal, and environmental impact of continued use of GE
ingredients/seeds. Evaluate the following:

      o     The relevance of the proposal in terms of the company's business and
            the proportion of it affected by the resolution;

      o     The quality of the company's disclosure on risks related to GE
            product use and how this disclosure compares with peer company
            disclosure;

      o     The percentage of revenue derived from international operations,
            particularly in Europe, where GE products are more regulated and
            consumer backlash is more pronounced.

Vote AGAINST proposals seeking a report on the health and environmental effects
of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Health studies of this sort are better
undertaken by regulators and the scientific community.

Vote AGAINST proposals to completely phase out GE ingredients from the company's
products or proposals asking for reports outlining the steps necessary to
eliminate GE ingredients from the company's products. Such resolutions
presuppose that there are proven health risks to GE ingredients (an issue better
left to federal regulators) that outweigh the economic benefits derived from
biotechnology.

HANDGUNS

Generally vote AGAINST requests for reports on a company's policies aimed at
curtailing gun violence in the United States unless the report is confined to
product safety information. Criminal misuse of firearms is beyond company
control and instead falls within the purview of law enforcement agencies.

            Africa and the number of local employees;

      o     The company's existing healthcare policies, including benefits and
            healthcare access for local workers;

      o     Company donations to healthcare providers operating in the region.

Vote AGAINST proposals asking companies to establish, implement, and report on a
standard of response to the HIV/AIDS, TB, and malaria health pandemic in Africa
and other developing countries, unless the company has significant operations in
these markets and has failed to adopt policies and/or procedures to address
these issues comparable to those of industry peers.

PREDATORY LENDING

Vote CASE-BY CASE on requests for reports on the company's procedures for
preventing predatory lending, including the establishment of a board committee
for oversight, taking into account:

      o     Whether the company has adequately disclosed mechanisms in place to
            prevent abusive lending practices;

================================================================================

(C) 2005 Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. All Rights Reserved.         35

<PAGE>

================================================================================

      o     Whether the company has adequately disclosed the financial risks of
            its subprime business;

      o     Whether the company has been subject to violations of lending laws
            or serious lending controversies;

taking into account the following factors:

Second-hand smoke:

      o     Whether the company complies with all local ordinances and
            regulations;

      o     The degree that voluntary restrictions beyond those mandated by law
            might hurt the company's competitiveness;

      o     The risk of any health-related liabilities.

Advertising to youth:

      o     Whether the company complies with federal, state, and local laws on
            the marketing of tobacco or if it has been fined for violations;

      o     Whether the company has gone as far as peers in restricting
            advertising;

      o     Whether the company entered into the Master Settlement Agreement,
            which restricts marketing of tobacco to youth;

      o     Whether restrictions on marketing to youth extend to foreign
            countries.

Cease production of tobacco-related products or avoid selling products to
tobacco companies:

      o     The percentage of the company's business affected;

      o     The economic loss of eliminating the business versus any potential
            tobacco-related liabilities.

Spin-off tobacco-related businesses:

      o     The percentage of the company's business affected;

      o     The feasibility of a spin-off;

      o     Potential future liabilities related to the company's tobacco
            business.

Stronger product warnings:

Vote AGAINST proposals seeking stronger product warnings. Such decisions are
better left to public health authorities.

the potential financial and legal risks associated with utilizing certain
chemicals, considering:

      o     Current regulations in the markets in which the company operates;

      o     Recent significant controversy, litigation, or fines stemming from
            toxic chemicals or ingredients at the company; and

      o     The current level of disclosure on this topic.

products within a certain timeframe unless such actions are required by law in
specific markets.

ENVIRONMENT AND ENERGY

ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE

      o     The company intends to pursue operations in the ANWR; and

      o     The company does not currently disclose an environmental risk report

CERES PRINCIPLES

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to adopt the CERES Principles, taking into
account:

      o     The company's current environmental disclosure beyond legal

      o     The company does not directly source from CAFOs.

ENVIRONMENTAL-ECONOMIC RISK REPORT

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals requesting an economic risk assessment of
environmental performance considering:

      o     The feasibility of financially quantifying environmental risk
            factors;

      o     The company's compliance with applicable legislation and/or
            regulations regarding environmental performance;

      o     The costs associated with implementing improved standards;

      o     The potential costs associated with remediation resulting from poor
            environmental performance; and

      o     The current level of disclosure on environmental policies and
            initiatives.

ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS

Generally vote FOR requests for reports disclosing the company's environmental
policies unless it already has well-documented environmental management systems
that are available to the public.

GLOBAL WARMING

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting a report on greenhouse gas emissions
from company operations and/or products unless this information is already
publicly disclosed or such factors are not integral to the company's line of
business.

      o     The company is non-compliant with Nuclear Regulatory Commission
            (NRC) requirements; or

            related to its nuclear operations.

renewable energy sources unless the report is duplicative of existing disclosure
or irrelevant to the company's line of business.

================================================================================

(C) 2005 Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. All Rights Reserved.         38

<PAGE>

================================================================================

Generally vote AGAINST proposals requesting that the company invest in renewable
energy sources. Such decisions are best left to management's evaluation of the
feasibility and financial impact that such programs may have on the company.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT

Generally vote FOR proposals requesting the company to report on policies and
initiatives related to social, economic, and environmental sustainability,
unless:

      o     The company already discloses similar information through existing
            reports or policies such as an Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS)

            activities; and

      o     The company has procedures in place to ensure that employee
            contributions to company-sponsored political action committees
            (PACs) are strictly voluntary and not coercive.

Vote AGAINST proposals barring the company from making political contributions.
Businesses are affected by legislation at the federal, state, and local level
and barring contributions can put the company at a competitive disadvantage.

Vote AGAINST proposals restricting the company from making charitable
contributions. Charitable contributions are generally useful for assisting
worthwhile causes and for creating goodwill in the community. In the absence of
bad faith, self-dealing, or gross negligence, management should determine which
contributions are in the best interests of the company.

Vote AGAINST proposals asking for a list of company executives, directors,
consultants, legal counsels, lobbyists, or investment bankers that have prior
government service and whether such service had a bearing on the business of the
company. Such a list would be burdensome to prepare without providing any
meaningful information to shareholders.

satisfaction, community involvement, human rights, environmental performance,

            setting pay;

      o     Violations or complaints filed against the company relating to the
            particular social performance measure;

      o     Artificial limits sought by the proposal, such as freezing or

      o     Current company pay levels.

associated with outsourcing, considering:

      o     Risks associated with certain international markets;

INTERNATIONAL CODES OF CONDUCT/VENDOR STANDARDS

Vote CASE-BY-CASE on proposals to implement certain human rights standards at
company facilities or those of its suppliers and to commit to outside,
independent monitoring. In evaluating these proposals, the following should be
considered:

      o     The company's current workplace code of conduct or adherence to
            other global standards and the degree they meet the standards
            promulgated by the proponent;

      o     Agreements with foreign suppliers to meet certain workplace
            standards;

      o     Whether company and vendor facilities are monitored and how;

Principles, taking into account:

            1989;

      o     Company antidiscrimination policies that already exceed the legal
            requirements;

      o     The cost and feasibility of adopting all nine principles;

      o     The cost of duplicating efforts to follow two sets of standards

            cluster bombs or their components;

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

         In general,  Four  Corners  seeks to allocate  the purchase and sale of
corporate  loans to  clients  in a fair and  equitable  manner  to  quickly  and
prudently  create a  well-constructed,  fully  invested  portfolio  of corporate
loans.  Since Four Corners' clients have varying  investment  restrictions,  and
because of the constraining  mechanics of the corporate loan market,  allocation
of  trades  through  methods  such as  pro-rata  allocation  are  not  feasible.
Therefore,  the  allocation  of corporate  loan  purchases  and sales to various
accounts  is  generally  based  on  factors  such  as  the  client's  investment
restrictions  and objectives,  including  expected  liquidity and/or third party
credit ratings, the client's acceptance or rejection of prospective investments,
if  applicable,  and the relative  percentage  of invested  assets of a client's
portfolio, among others. Assets may be disproportionately  allocated to accounts
during their initial  investment  (ramp up) period,  notwithstanding  that other
accounts may also have assets  available for investment.  Such  disproportionate
allocation to accounts during the ramp-up process may have a detrimental  effect
on other accounts. Subject to the foregoing, whenever Four Corners' clients have
available  funds for investment,  investments  suitable and appropriate for each
will be  allocated  in a manner Four  Corners  believes to be equitable to each,
although such  allocation  may result in a delay in one or more client  accounts
being  fully  invested  that would not occur if an  allocation  to other  client
accounts  were  not  made.  Moreover,  it is  possible  that  due  to  differing
investment  objectives or for other reasons, Four Corners and its affiliates may
purchase  securities  or loans of an issuer for one client and at  approximately
the same time recommend  selling or sell the same or similar types of securities
or loans for another  client.  For these and other  reasons,  not all portfolios
will  participate in the gains or losses  experienced by other  portfolios  with
similar investment objectives.

(A)(3)   COMPENSATION STRUCTURE OF PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S) OR MANAGEMENT TEAM
         MEMBERS

         The portfolio managers' compensation is determined by the profitability
of Four Corners  Capital  Management as a firm without regard to the performance
of any one  particular  fund. The portfolio  managers have limited  incentive to
take undue risks when performance is lagging because of the indirect  connection
between  better fund  performance  and personal  compensation.  Compensation  is
typically comprised of a base salary and bonus.

                            SENIOR FINANCIAL OFFICER
                                 CODE OF CONDUCT
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.       INTRODUCTION.

         This code of  conduct  is being  adopted  by the  investment  companies
advised by First Trust Advisors,  L.P.,  from time to time,  (the "FUNDS").  The
reputation and integrity of the Funds are valuable  assets that are vital to the
Funds'  success.  Each officer of the Funds,  and officers and  employees of the
investment adviser to the Funds who work on Fund matters,  including each of the
Funds' senior financial  officers  ("SFOS"),  is responsible for conducting each
Fund's  business  in a manner  that  demonstrates  a  commitment  to the highest
standards of integrity. SFOs include the Principal Executive Officer (who is the
President),  the Controller (who is the principal accounting  officer),  and the
Treasurer (who is the principal financial officer),  and any person who performs
a similar function.

         The Funds,  First Trust Advisors,  L.P. and First Trust Portfolios have
adopted  Codes of Ethics  under Rule 17j-1 under the  Investment  Company Act of
1940 (the "RULE  17J-1  CODE").  These  Codes of Ethics are  designed to prevent
certain  conflicts  of  interest  that may arise when  officers,  employees,  or
directors of the Funds and the  foregoing  entities know about present or future
Fund  transactions  and/or have the power to influence those  transactions,  and
engage in  transactions  with respect to those same securities in their personal
account(s) or otherwise  take  advantage of their  position and  knowledge  with
respect to those  securities.  In an effort to prevent  these  conflicts  and in
accordance with Rule 17j-1,  the Funds adopted their Rule 17j-1 Code to prohibit
transactions  and conduct that create  conflicts  of interest,  and to establish
compliance procedures.

         The  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002  was  designed  to  address  corporate
malfeasance and to help assure investors that the companies in which they invest
are accurately and completely  disclosing financial  information.  Under Section
406 of the Act, all public  companies  (including  the Funds) must either have a
code of ethics for their SFOs, or disclose why they do not. The Act was intended
to prevent  future  situations  (such as  occurred in  well-reported  situations
involving  such  companies  as Enron and  WorldCom)  where a company  creates an
environment  in which  employees  are afraid to  express  their  opinions  or to
question unethical and potentially illegal business practices.

         The Funds  have  chosen  to adopt a senior  financial  officer  Code of
Conduct to encourage  their SFOs, and other Fund officers and employees of First
Trust  Advisors  or First Trust  Portfolios,  to act  ethically  and to question
potentially  unethical  or illegal  practices,  and to strive to ensure that the
Funds' financial disclosures are complete, accurate, and understandable.

II.      PURPOSES OF THIS CODE OF CONDUCT.

         The purposes of this Code are:

                A. To promote honest and ethical conduct,  including the ethical
         handling of actual or apparent  conflicts of interest  between personal
         and professional relationships;

                B. To promote full, fair,  accurate,  timely, and understandable
         disclosure  in reports  and  documents  that the Funds  file  with,  or
         submits to, the SEC and in other public communications the Funds make;

                C. To promote  compliance  with  applicable  governmental  laws,
         rules and regulations;

                D. To encourage the prompt internal  reporting to an appropriate
         person of violations of the Code; and

                E. To establish accountability for adherence to the Code.

III.     QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CODE.

         The Funds' Boards of Trustees have designated Mitchell E. Mohr or other
appropriate  officer  designated by the President of the respective  Funds to be
the Compliance  Coordinator for the  implementation  and  administration  of the
Code.

IV.      HANDLING OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

         The Funds have adopted  guidelines  under which its SFOs perform  their
duties.  However, the Funds expect that all officers or employees of the adviser
or  distributor  who  participate  in the  preparation of any part of any Fund's
financial statements follow these guidelines with respect to each Fund:

                A. Act with honesty and integrity  and avoid  violations of this
         Code,  including actual or apparent conflicts of interest with the Fund
         in personal and professional relationships.

                B. Disclose to the Fund's  Compliance  Coordinator  any material
         transaction or relationship  that reasonably  could be expected to give
         rise to any  violations  of the  Code,  including  actual  or  apparent
         conflicts  of  interest  with  the  Fund.  You  should  disclose  these
         transactions  or  relationships  whether you are  involved or have only
         observed  the  transaction  or  relationship.  If it is not possible to
         disclose  the  matter  to the  Compliance  Coordinator,  it  should  be
         disclosed  to the  Fund's  Principal  Financial  Officer  or  Principal
         Executive Officer.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLIANCE MANUAL                E-4-2                              APPENDIX E-4

<PAGE>

                C.  Provide   information  to  the  Fund's  other  officers  and
         appropriate  employees of service  providers  (adviser,  administrator,
         outside auditor,  outside counsel,  custodian,  etc.) that is accurate,
         complete, objective, relevant, timely, and understandable.

                D.  Endeavor  to  ensure  full,  fair,  timely,   accurate,  and
         understandable disclosure in the Fund's periodic reports.

                E. Comply with the federal  securities laws and other applicable
         laws and rules, such as the Internal Revenue Code.

                F. Act in good faith, responsibly, and with due care, competence
         and diligence,  without misrepresenting material facts or allowing your
         independent judgment to be subordinated.

                G. Respect the  confidentiality  of information  acquired in the
         course of your work except  when you have Fund  approval to disclose it
         or where  disclosure  is otherwise  legally  mandated.  You may not use
         confidential  information  acquired  in the  course  of your  work  for
         personal advantage.

                H. Share and  maintain  skills  important  and  relevant  to the
         Fund's needs.

                I. Proactively promote ethical behavior among peers in your work
         environment.

                J. Responsibly use and control all assets and resources employed
         or entrusted to you.

                K.  Record or  participate  in the  recording  of entries in the
         Fund's  books  and  records  that  are  accurate  to the  best  of your
         knowledge.

V.       WAIVERS OF THIS CODE.

         SFOs and other  parties  subject to this Code may request a waiver of a
provision of this Code (or certain  provisions of the Fund's Rule 17j-1 Code) by
submitting   their  request  in  writing  to  the  Compliance   Coordinator  for
appropriate review. An executive officer of the Fund or the Audit Committee will
decide whether to grant a waiver.  All waivers of this Code must be disclosed to
the Fund's  shareholders  to the  extent  required  by SEC  rules.  A good faith
interpretation of the provisions of this Code,  however,  shall not constitute a
waiver.

VI.      ANNUAL CERTIFICATION.

         Each SFO will be asked to certify on an annual  basis that he/she is in
full compliance with the Code and any related policy statements.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLIANCE MANUAL                E-4-3                              APPENDIX E-4

<PAGE>

VII.     REPORTING SUSPECTED VIOLATIONS.

          A. SFOs or other officers of the Funds or employees of the First Trust
group who work on Fund matters who observe, learn of, or, in good faith, suspect
a violation of the Code MUST immediately  report the violation to the Compliance
Coordinator, another member of the Funds' or First Trust's senior management, or
to the  Audit  Committee  of the Fund  Board.  An  example  of a  possible  Code
violation  is the  preparation  and filing of  financial  disclosure  that omits
material  facts,  or that is accurate but is written in a way that  obscures its
meaning.

          B.  Because  service  providers  such  as  an  administrator,  outside
accounting  firm, and custodian  provide much of the work relating to the Funds'
financial statements,  you should be alert for actions by service providers that
may be illegal,  or that could be viewed as dishonest or unethical conduct.  You
should report these actions to the Compliance  Coordinator  even if you know, or
think,  that the  service  provider  has its own code of ethics  for its SFOs or
employees.

          C. SFOs or other  officers  or  employees  who  report  violations  or
suspected  violations  in good faith will not be subject to  retaliation  of any
kind.  Reported  violations will be investigated and addressed promptly and will
be treated confidentially to the extent possible.

VIII.    VIOLATIONS OF THE CODE.

          A. Dishonest, unethical or illegal conduct will constitute a violation
of this  Code,  regardless  of  whether  this Code  specifically  refers to that
particular conduct. A violation of this Code may result in disciplinary  action,
up to and including  termination of  employment.  A variety of laws apply to the
Funds and their operations, including the Securities Act of 1933, the Investment
Company Act of 1940,  state laws  relating to duties owed by Fund  directors and
officers,  and criminal laws. The federal securities laws generally prohibit the
Funds from making material  misstatements  in its prospectus and other documents
filed with the SEC, or from omitting to state a material  fact.  These  material
misstatements and omissions include financial  statements that are misleading or
omit materials facts.

          B.  Examples  of  criminal  violations  of the law  include  stealing,
embezzling,  misapplying  corporate  or bank  funds,  making  a  payment  for an
expressed  purpose on a Fund's behalf to an individual who intends to use it for
a different purpose; or making payments,  whether corporate or personal, of cash
or other items of value that are intended to  influence  the judgment or actions
of political  candidates,  government officials or businesses in connection with
any of the  Funds'  activities.  The Funds must and will  report  all  suspected
criminal violations to the appropriate authorities for possible prosecution, and
will investigate, address and report, as appropriate, non-criminal violations.
