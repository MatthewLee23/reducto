Dear Fellow Shareholder:

Throughout the period ended April 30, 2005, the Federal Reserve Board's
series of gradual increases in the federal funds rate occupied much of
investors' attention. However, these increases did not begin to have a
significant impact on stock and bond prices until the early months of
the 2005 calendar year. The Fed's more restrictive monetary policy,
along with stubbornly high energy prices, has caused concern about the
sustainability of corporate profits and slowed the stock market's
momentum. Prices of shorter-term bonds have also been under pressure due
to worries regarding inflation. In addition, credit quality issues have
become a greater concern, particularly in early May, after the end of
the reporting period, when rating agencies downgraded bonds issued by
Ford and General Motors. Given the uncertainties of this environment,
security selection takes on even greater importance and the in-depth,
professional research and active management that mutual funds can
provide makes them an even more intelligent choice for today's
investors.

We want you to know that Putnam Investments' management team, under the
leadership of Chief Executive Officer Ed Haldeman, continues to focus on
investment performance and remains committed to putting the interests of
shareholders first. In keeping with these goals, we are including
additional disclosure about your fund's management team in this report.
Following the Outlook for Your Fund, we provide manager compensation
information that pertains to your fund. Furthermore, in this report we
provide information about the 2004 approval by the Trustees of your
fund's management contract with Putnam. See page 13 for details.

In the following pages, members of your fund's management team discuss
the fund's performance, the strategies used to pursue the fund's
investment objectives during the reporting period, and the team's plan
for responding to recent changes in the market climate.
As always, we thank you for your continuing confidence in Putnam.

Respectfully yours,

/S/ JOHN A. HILL              /S/ GEORGE PUTNAM, III

Report from Fund Management

Fund highlights

* For the six months ended April 30, 2005, Putnam Managed Municipal
  Income Trust returned 4.41% at net asset value (NAV) and 1.42% at market
  price.

* The fund's benchmark, the Lehman Municipal Bond Index, returned 1.94%.

* The average return for the fund's Lipper category, High Yield
  Municipal Debt Funds (closed-end), was 5.59%.

* The fund's divided was reduced to $0.0381  per share in January 2005.
  See page 5 for  more information.

* See the Performance Summary beginning on  page 10 for additional fund
  performance,  comparative performance, and Lipper data.

Performance commentary

For the six-month period, Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust
outperformed its benchmark, the Lehman Municipal Bond Index, based on
results at NAV. The fund's position in strong-performing higher-yielding
bonds helped it to outperform the index. Our use of leverage, which
magnifies performance results, also contributed to outperformance.
However, the fund underperformed the average return of funds in its
Lipper peer group, High Yield Municipal Debt Funds (closed-end). We
attribute this underperformance to the fund's larger weighting in
higher-quality bonds, which were not as strong during the period.
Additionally, the fund was not as well positioned as its peers for the
yield curve changes that took place during the period. It is important
to note that a fund's performance at market price may differ from its
results at NAV. Although market price performance generally reflects
investment results, it may also be influenced by several other factors,
including changes in investor perceptions of the fund or its investment
advisor, market conditions, fluctuations in supply and demand for the
fund's shares, and changes in fund distributions.

FUND PROFILE

Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust is a leveraged fund that seeks to
provide a high level of current income free from federal income tax
through investments in investment-grade and higher-yielding, lower-rated
municipal bonds. The fund is designed for investors seeking tax-exempt
income and who are willing to accept the risks associated with
below-investment-grade bonds and the use of leverage.


Market overview

Over the past six months, longer-term yields remained largely unchanged
while yields on shorter-term securities rose in tandem with
interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed). Signs of
accelerating economic growth and rising corporate profits prompted the
Fed to increase the federal funds rate four times during the six-month
period, in 0.25% increments. It continued this tightening policy with
another 0.25% increase following period-end. The Fed uses interest-rate
increases in its efforts to rein in economic growth with the goal of
limiting its potential inflationary impact. Rising short-term rates and
relatively stable long-term rates resulted in a flattening of the yield
curve, as shorter- and longer-term interest rates began to converge.

The same conditions that led to rising interest rates -- an improving
economy and rising corporate earnings -- were particularly favorable for
lower-rated bonds. Among uninsured bonds and especially bonds rated BBB
and below, yield spreads tightened, and bond prices rose. Bonds at the
lower end of the credit spectrum, including BB- and B-rated bonds,
turned in the strongest performance as yield-seeking non-traditional
buyers of municipal bonds helped fuel demand. There was limited
variation in municipal bond performance among states during the
six-month period. Based on continued favorable legal rulings, yields on
tobacco settlement bonds declined overall during the period, and their
prices rose accordingly. After underperforming for most of the year,
airline-related industrial development bonds (IDBs) staged a comeback
from distressed levels and outperformed over the trailing six-month
period. Callable bonds (which can be redeemed by their issuers before
maturity) outperformed non-callable bonds.

Strategy overview

Given our expectation for rising interest rates, we maintained a
relatively short (or defensive) duration position throughout the
six-month period. One of the strategies we used to manage duration was
selling Treasury bond futures, which enabled us to achieve our target
duration without trading large volumes of securities. Investing in bonds
with a short duration may help protect principal when interest rates are
rising, but it can reduce the fund's potential for appreciation when
rates fall. Although the Fed adjusted interest rates upward during the
period, as we had expected, rates on long-term bonds trended downward
for much of the period, limiting the fund's participation in the price
rally.

During the period, the fund changed its positioning to take advantage of
the flattening of the yield curve. Given our expectation that short-term
rates would continue to rise, we reduced the fund's positions in inverse
floating-rate securities during the period. These securities pay
additional interest income as short rates fall and less interest income
when short rates rise. By decreasing the fund's exposure to them, we
took a defensive position against rising short-term rates. Another
technique we used to position the fund to benefit from yield curve
flattening was to buy callable bonds with longer maturities and to sell
non-callable bonds with shorter (generally 10 years or less) maturities.
We believe that callable bonds will outperform going forward.

The fund's relative performance versus the Lehman benchmark benefited
from its exposure to lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds which are not
part of the benchmark. However, the fund underperformed its Lipper peer
group because its weighting in this strong-performing market area was
less than that of its peers. We believe the high-yield rally has nearly
run its course; therefore, the fund's underweight position relative to
its peers may be beneficial in the long term.

How fund holdings affected performance

The continued strong performance of lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds
was a significant factor during the period. In particular,
airline-related industrial development bonds (IDBs), which generally
fall into this rating category, staged a strong comeback during the past
six months, despite concerns about oil prices. Most of this performance
was driven by yield-hungry investors who have become more willing to dip
into riskier sectors. We underweighted airline-related IDBs relative to
the fund's peer group because our credit analysts' view on these bonds
was unfavorable -- a strategy that detracted from relative performance
versus its peers for the period. The fund does still own a few small
airline-related positions backed by Continental, American, and British
Air. These contributed to relative performance versus its Lehman
benchmark, which has no exposure to this market segment.

A relatively modest overweight position in tobacco settlement bonds,
compared to the benchmark, helped performance. This strategy was based
on our favorable view of this sector and on the availability of
attractive yields in this market segment. Tobacco settlement bonds,
secured by the income stream from tobacco companies' settlement
obligations to the states, generally offer higher yields than bonds of
comparable quality. This sector benefited from a February 4, 2005,
ruling by the DC Circuit Federal appeals court against the federal
government. Taking a cue from the success of the states in securing a
settlement from tobacco companies, the federal government sought a
remedy of $280 billion from tobacco manufacturers. The DC court ruling
stated that disgorgement was not a remedy available to the federal
government under the statute on which the Department of Justice (DOJ)
based its claim. This decision significantly mitigated the potential
financial impact of the DOJ's claim on the industry, helping to reassure
tobacco settlement bond investors that tobacco companies would likely be
able to continue to meet their obligations to the states. The fund owns
tobacco settlement bonds issued by Wisconsin, the District of Columbia,
South Dakota, South Carolina, and California, all of which performed well
during the period.

will vary over time.


On an issue-specific basis, the fund benefited from a pre-refunding of
bonds held in its portfolio. Pre-refunding occurs when an issuer raises
the money to refinance an older, higher-coupon bond by issuing new bonds
at current lower interest rates. This money is then invested in a secure
investment, usually U.S. Treasury securities, that mature at the older
bond's first call date, when it is used to pay off the old bonds. This
added security is often perceived as a credit upgrade by the market, and
can boost the price of the older bonds. In December 2004, zero coupon
bonds issued by E-470 Public Highway Authority -- an entity created to
fund, build, and manage toll highways serving metropolitan Denver,
Colorado -- were pre-refunded. These were revenue bonds issued in 2000
with an original maturity date of 2034. The bonds were pre-refunded to
2010 and the rating on the bonds was raised from Baa3 to Aaa.

Fund performance also was boosted by the increase in value of some
distressed bonds held in the portfolio. These bonds were issued by the
Waterford Economic Development Corporation to fund Canterbury
on-the-Lake, a continuing care retirement community located in
Waterford, Michigan. During the period, bondholders worked with the
issuer to restructure the credit. The price of the bonds rose as
bondholders agreed in principle to tender the outstanding bonds in lieu
of new debt.

The fund began to buy longer-term, callable bonds and sell shorter-term
non-callable securities during the period -- a strategy we plan to
continue to pursue as we believe callable bonds are likely to provide
better performance. In November 2004 we bought $5 million of insured
revenue bonds issued by Atlanta Airport. These bonds are scheduled to
mature in 2027 but are callable in 2015. To finance this purchase, we
sold $5 million of insured revenue bonds issued by Intermountain Power
Agency. These bonds were non-callable and mature in 2011.

We believe that the market has over-discounted the potentially negative
impact of mortgage prepayments on the single family housing sector,
particularly in light of rising interest rates, which are likely to slow
prepayments. During the period we purchased $760,000 of single-family
mortgage revenue bonds issued by Minnesota State Housing Finance Agency.

Please note that all holdings discussed in this report are subject to
review in  accordance with the fund's investment strategy and may vary
in the future.


OF SPECIAL INTEREST

Fund's dividend reduced

Yields have declined significantly across all fixed-income sectors over
the course of a prolonged bond-market rally. Additionally, several older
holdings were called or matured during the period, requiring
reinvestment of the assets at current lower interest rates. To reflect
this reduction in earnings, the fund's dividend was reduced from $0.0417
to $0.0381 per share in January 2005.


The outlook for your fund

The following commentary reflects anticipated developments that could
affect your fund over the next six months, as well as your management
team's plans for responding to them.

Economic growth has continued to be stronger than expected, despite the
Fed's efforts to slow growth and curb inflation by raising short-term
interest rates four times in 0.25% increments in the first half of the
fund's 2005 fiscal year. Long-term rates remain surprisingly low. In
fact, after rising modestly in late March and early April of 2005, long
rates fell again in the final weeks of the period. Based on sustained
solid economic growth and continued robust corporate earnings, we expect
the Fed to maintain its policy of increasing rates through 2005. We
believe Fed actions are likely to cause rising yields among bonds with
shorter maturities and further flattening of the yield curve as
short-term rates rise faster than long-term rates. We also expect more
Fed tightening than is currently anticipated by the market, and believe
that bond yields may begin to rise more quickly as other investors come
to the same conclusion. In light of current market conditions, we plan
to maintain the fund's defensive duration and to continue to increase
its exposure to callable bonds, which, in our opinion, are likely to
outperform in a rising-rate cycle.

We have a positive view on the single-family housing sector and plan to
add selectively to the fund's positions. We believe that the dramatic
outperformance of lower-rated, higher-yielding bonds will likely slow
down and we plan to reduce our exposure to this portion of the credit
spectrum in favor of higher-quality issues. Despite recent
outperformance, we remain bearish on airline-related IDBs in light of
likely continued fundamental weaknesses in this sector such as rising
fuel prices and domestic overcapacity. Our view on tobacco settlement
bonds is positive and we are seeking to increase the fund's exposure as
opportunities arise.

We believe we are headed into a more challenging environment for bond
investing. Our task will be to continue to search for the most
attractive opportunities among tax-exempt securities, and to balance the
pursuit of current income with prudent risk management.

The views expressed in this report are exclusively those of Putnam
Management. They are not meant as investment advice. Lower-rated bonds
may offer higher yields in return for more risk. Capital gains, if any,
are taxable for federal and, in most cases, state purposes. For some
investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax. Income from federally exempt funds may be subject to state
and local taxes. Mutual funds that invest in bonds are subject to
certain risks, including interest-rate risk, credit risk, and inflation
risk. As interest rates rise, the prices of bonds fall. Long-term bonds
are more exposed to interest-rate risk than short-term bonds. Unlike
bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses.  The fund's shares
trade on a stock exchange at market prices, which may be lower than the
fund's net asset value. The fund uses leverage, which involves risk and
may increase the volatility of the fund's net asset value.

Performance summary

This section shows your fund's performance during the first half of its
fiscal year, which ended April 30, 2005. In accordance with regulatory
requirements, we also include performance for the most current calendar
quarter-end. Performance should always be considered in light of a
fund's investment strategy. Data represents past performance. Past
performance does not guarantee future results. More recent returns may
be less or more than those shown. Investment return, net asset value,
and market price will fluctuate and you may have a gain or a loss when
you sell your shares.

Trustee approval of management contract

General conclusions

The Board of Trustees of the Putnam funds oversees the management of
each fund and, as required by law, determines annually whether to
approve the continuance of each fund's management contract with Putnam
Management. In this regard the Board of Trustees, with the assistance of
its Contract Committee consisting solely of Independent Trustees,
requests and evaluates all information it deems reasonably necessary in
the circumstances. Over the course of several months beginning in March
and ending in June of 2004, the Contract Committee reviewed the
information provided by Putnam Management and other information
developed with the assistance of the Board's independent counsel and
independent staff. The Contract Committee reviewed and discussed key
aspects of this information with all of the Independent Trustees. Upon
completion of this review, the Contract Committee recommended and the
Independent Trustees approved the continuance of your fund's contract,
effective July 1, 2004.

This approval was based on the following conclusions:

* That the fee schedule currently in effect for your fund represents
  reasonable compensation in light of the nature and quality of the
  services being provided to the fund, the fees paid by competitive funds
  and the costs incurred by Putnam Management in providing such service,
  and

* That such fee schedule represents an appropriate sharing between fund
  shareholders and Putnam Management of such economies of scale as may
  exist in the management of the fund at current asset levels.

These conclusions were based on a comprehensive consideration of all
information provided to the Trustees and were not the result of any
single factor. Some of the factors that figured particularly in the
Trustees' deliberations are described below.

Model fee schedules and categories; total expenses

The Trustees, working in cooperation with Putnam Management, have
developed and implemented a series of model fee schedules for the Putnam
funds designed to ensure that each fund's management fee is consistent
with the fees for similar funds in the Putnam complex and compares
favorably with fees paid by competitive funds sponsored by other advisors.
The Trustees reviewed the model fee schedule currently in effect for the
fund, including fee levels and breakpoints, and the assignment of the fund
to a particular fee category under this structure. The Trustees also
reviewed comparative fee and expense information for competitive funds.
The Trustees concluded that no changes should be made in the fund's
current fee schedule at this time. The Trustees noted that expense ratios
for a number of Putnam funds had been increasing recently as a result of
declining net assets and the natural operation of fee breakpoints. They
noted that such expense ratio increases were currently being controlled by
expense limitations implemented in January 2004. They also noted that the
competitive landscape regarding mutual fund fees may be changing as a
result of fee reductions accepted by various other fund groups in
connection with recent regulatory settlements and greater focus on fees
and expenses in the mutual fund industry generally. The Trustees indicated
an intention to monitor these developments closely.

Economies of scale

As noted above, the Trustees concluded that the fee schedule currently
in effect for your fund represents an appropriate sharing of economies
of scale at current asset levels. The Trustees indicated their intention
to continue their ongoing consideration of economies of scale and in
particular to consider further the possible operation of such economies
in the event that a significant recovery in the equity markets or net
fund sales were to raise asset levels substantially above current
levels. In this regard, the Trustees noted that they had reviewed data
relating to the substantial increase in asset levels of the Putnam funds
that occurred during the years leading up to the market peak in 2000,
the subsequent decline in assets and the resulting impact on revenues
and expenses of Putnam Management. The Trustees also noted that recent
declines in net assets in many Putnam funds, together with significant
changes in the cost structure of Putnam Management have altered the
economics of Putnam Management's business in significant ways. The
Trustees concluded that they would monitor these changes carefully and
evaluate the resulting impact on Putnam Management's economics and the
sharing of economies of scale between the parties.

Investment performance

The quality of the investment process provided by Putnam Management
represented a major factor in the Trustees' evaluation of the quality of
services provided by Putnam Management under the Management Contracts.
The Trustees recognized that a high quality investment process -- as
measured by the experience and skills of the individuals assigned to the
management of fund portfolios, the resources made available to such
personnel, and in general the ability of Putnam Management to attract
and retain high-quality personnel -- does not guarantee favorable
investment results for every fund in every time period. The Trustees
considered the investment performance of each fund over multiple time
periods and considered information comparing the fund's performance with
various benchmarks and with the performance of competitive funds. The
Trustees noted the satisfactory investment performance of many Putnam
funds.

They also noted the disappointing investment performance of certain
funds in recent years and continued to discuss with senior management of
Putnam Management the factors contributing to such under-performance and
actions being taken to improve performance. The Trustees recognized
that, in recent years, Putnam Management has made significant changes in
its investment personnel and processes and in the fund product line in
an effort to address areas of underperformance. The Trustees indicated
their intention to continue to monitor performance trends to assess the
effectiveness of these changes and to evaluate whether additional
remedial changes are warranted. As a general matter, the Trustees
concluded that consultation between the Trustees and Putnam Management
represents the most effective way to address investment performance
problems. The Trustees believe that investors in the Putnam funds and
their financial advisors have, as a general matter, effectively placed
their trust in the Putnam organization, under the supervision of the
funds' Trustees, to make appropriate decisions regarding the management
of the funds. The Trustees believe that the termination of the
Management Contract and engagement of a new investment adviser for
under-performing funds, with all the attendant disruptions, would not
serve the interests of fund shareholders at this time and would not
necessarily provide any greater assurance of improved investment
performance.

Brokerage and soft-dollar allocations; other benefits

The Trustees considered various potential benefits that Putnam
Management may receive in connection with the services it provides under
the Management Contract with your fund. These include principally
benefits related to brokerage and soft-dollar allocations, which pertain
mainly to funds investing in equity securities. The Trustees believe
that soft-dollar credits and other potential benefits associated with
the allocation of fund brokerage represent assets of the funds that
should be used for the benefit of fund shareholders. The Trustees noted
recent trends in the allocation of fund brokerage, including commission
costs, the allocation of brokerage to firms that provide research
services to Putnam Management, and the sources and application of
available soft-dollar credits. Effective December 31, 2003, reflecting a
decision made by the Trustees earlier that year, Putnam Management
ceased allocating brokerage in connection with the sale of fund shares.
In addition, in preparing its budget for commission allocations in 2004,
Putnam Management voluntarily reduced substantially the allocation of
brokerage commissions to acquire research services from third-party
service providers. In light of evolving best practices in the mutual
fund industry, the Trustees concluded that this practice should be
further curtailed and possibly eliminated in the near future. The
Trustees indicated that they would continue to monitor the allocation of
the funds' brokerage to ensure that the principle of "best price and
execution" remains paramount in the portfolio trading process.


Comparison of retail and institutional fee schedules

The information examined by the Trustees as part of the annual contract
reviews included information regarding fees charged by Putnam Management
and its affiliates to institutional clients such as defined benefit
pension plans and college endowments. This information included
comparison of such fees with fees charged to the Putnam funds, as well
as a detailed assessment of the differences in the services provided to
these two types of clients. The Trustees devoted special attention to
these issues and reviewed recent articles by critics of mutual fund
fees, articles by the ICI defending such fee differences, and relevant
guidance provided by decisions of the courts. The Trustees observed, in
this regard, that the differences in fee rates between institutional
clients and mutual funds are by no means uniform when examined by
individual asset sectors, suggesting that differences in the pricing of
investment management services to these types of clients reflects to a
substantial degree historical competitive forces operating in separate
market places. In reaching their conclusions, the Trustees considered
the fact that fee rates across all asset sectors are higher on average
for mutual funds than for institutional clients, and also considered the
differences between the services that Putnam provides to the Putnam
funds and those that it provides to institutional clients of the firm.

Settlement of regulatory charges related to market timing

Finally, in reaching their conclusions, the Trustees considered all
matters pertinent to the administrative charges filed against Putnam
Management by the SEC and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in October
2003 relating to market timing, the firm's settlement of those charges,
and the conclusions and recommendations of the Trustees' Audit and
Pricing Committee based on its review of these matters. The Trustees
considered the actions taken by the owner of Putnam Management and its
new senior management to terminate or discipline the individuals
involved, to implement new compliance systems, to indemnify the funds
against all costs and liabilities related to these matters, and
otherwise to ensure that the interests of the funds and their
shareholders are fully protected. The Trustees noted that, in addition
to the settlements of the regulatory charges which will provide
comprehensive restitution for any losses suffered by shareholders, the
new senior management of Putnam Management has moved aggressively to
control expense ratios of funds affected by market timing, to reduce
charges to new investors, to improve disclosure of fees and expenses,
and to emphasize the paramount role of investment performance in
achieving shareholders' investment goals.

Notes to financial statements
April 30, 2005 (Unaudited)

Note 1
Significant accounting policies

Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust (the "fund"), a Massachusetts
business trust,  is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, as a diversified, closed-end management investment company.
The fund's investment objective is to seek a high level of current
income exempt from federal income tax. The fund intends to achieve its
objective by investing in a diversified portfolio of tax-exempt
municipal securities which Putnam Investment Management, LLC ("Putnam
Management"), the fund's manager, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Putnam, LLC, believes does not involve undue risk to income or
principal. Up to 60% of the fund's assets may consist of high-yield
tax-exempt municipal securities that are below investment grade and
involve special risk considerations. The fund also uses leverage by
issuing preferred shares in an effort to increase the income to the
common shares.

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies
consistently followed by the fund in the preparation of its financial
statements. The preparation of financial statements is in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial
statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net
assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

A) Security valuation Tax-exempt bonds and notes are valued at fair
value on the basis of valuations provided by an independent pricing
service, approved by the Trustees.  Such services use information with
respect to transactions in bonds, quotations from bond dealers, market
transactions in comparable securities and various relationships between
securities in determining value. Other investments are valued at fair
value following procedures approved by the Trustees.  Such valuations
and procedures are reviewed periodically by the Trustees.

B) Security transactions and related investment income Security
transactions are recorded on the trade date (date the order to buy or
sell is executed). Gains or losses on securities sold are determined on
the identified cost basis.

Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. All premiums/discounts
are amortized/accreted on a yield-to-maturity basis. The premium in
excess of the call price, if any, is amortized to the call date;
thereafter, any remaining premium is amortized to maturity.

C) Futures and options contracts The fund may use futures and options
contracts to hedge against changes in the values of securities the fund
owns or expects to purchase. The fund may also write options on
securities it owns or in which it may invest to increase its current
returns.

The potential risk to the fund is that the change in value of futures
and options contracts may not correspond to the change in value of the
hedged instruments. In addition, losses may arise from changes in the
value of the underlying instruments, if there is an illiquid secondary
market for the contracts, or if the counterparty to the contract is
unable to perform. Risks may exceed amounts recognized on the statement
of assets and liabilities. When the contract is closed, the fund records
a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of the
contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it was
closed. Realized gains and losses on purchased options are included in
realized gains and losses on investment securities. If a written call
option is exercised, the premium originally received is recorded as an
addition to sales proceeds. If a written put option is exercised, the
premium originally received is recorded as a reduction to the cost of
investments.

Futures contracts are valued at the quoted daily settlement prices
established by the exchange on which they trade. The fund and the broker
agree to exchange an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation in
the value of the futures contract.  Such receipts or payments are known
as "variation margin." Exchange traded options are valued at the last
sale price, or if no sales are reported, the last bid price for
purchased options and the last ask price for written options. Options
traded over-the-counter are valued using prices supplied by dealers.
Futures and written option contracts outstanding at period end, if any,
are listed after the fund's portfolio.

D) Federal taxes It is the policy of the fund to distribute all of its
income within the prescribed time and otherwise comply with the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") applicable
to regulated investment companies.  It is also the intention of the fund
to distribute an amount sufficient to avoid imposition of any excise tax
under Section 4982 of the Code, as amended. Therefore, no provision has
been made for federal taxes on income, capital gains or unrealized
appreciation on securities held nor for excise tax on income and capital
gains.

At October 31, 2004, the fund had a capital loss carryover of
$58,719,216 available to the extent allowed by the Code to offset future
net capital gain, if any. The amount of the carryover and the expiration
dates are:

Loss Carryover  Expiration
- --------------------------------
   $11,188,485  October 31, 2005
     2,894,998  October 31, 2006
     3,629,209  October 31, 2007
     1,237,146  October 31, 2008
     1,641,465  October 31, 2009
     3,729,886  October 31, 2010
    25,837,158  October 31, 2011
     8,560,869  October 31, 2012

The aggregate identified cost on a tax basis is $540,156,970, resulting
in gross unrealized  appreciation and depreciation of $25,511,495 and
$7,844,602, respectively, or net unrealized  appreciation of
$17,666,893.

E) Distributions to shareholders Distributions to common and preferred
shareholders from net investment income are recorded by the fund on the
ex-dividend date. Distributions from capital gains, if any, are recorded
on the ex-dividend date and paid at least annually. Dividends on
remarketed preferred shares become payable when, as and if declared by
the Trustees. Each dividend period for the remarketed preferred shares
is generally a 28-day period for Series A and Series B shares, and a
7-day period for Series C shares.  The applicable dividend rate for the
remarketed preferred shares on April 30, 2005 was 2.85% for Series A,
2.25% for Series B and 2.50% for Series C. The amount and character of
income and gains to be distributed are determined in accordance with
income tax regulations, which may differ from generally accepted
accounting principles. Reclassifications are made to the fund's capital
accounts to reflect income and gains available for distribution (or
available capital loss carryovers) under income tax regulations.

F) Determination of net asset value Net asset value of the common shares
is determined by dividing the value of all assets of the fund, less all
liabilities and the liquidation preference of any outstanding remarketed
preferred shares, by the total number of common shares outstanding as of
period end.

Note 2
Management fee, administrative
services and other transactions

Putnam Management is paid for management and investment advisory
services quarterly based on the average net assets attributable to
common and preferred shares outstanding of the fund. Such fee is based
on 0.70% of the first $500 million of average net assets, and 0.60% of
the next $500 million of average weekly net assets attributable to
common and preferred shares outstanding.

If dividends payable on remarketed preferred shares during any dividend
payment period plus any expenses attributable to remarketed preferred
shares for that period exceed the fund's gross income attributable to
the proceeds of the remarketed preferred shares during that period,
then the fee payable to Putnam Management for that period will be
reduced by the amount of the excess (but not more than 0.70% of the
liquidation preference of the remarketed preferred shares outstanding
during the period).

The fund reimburses Putnam Management an allocated amount for the
compensation and related expenses of certain officers of the fund and
their staff who provide administrative services to the fund. The
aggregate amount of all such reimbursements is determined annually by
the Trustees.

Custodial functions for the fund's assets are provided by Putnam
Fiduciary Trust Company ("PFTC"), a subsidiary of Putnam, LLC. Putnam
Investor Services, a division of PFTC, provides investor servicing agent
functions to the fund. During the six months ended April 30, 2005, the
fund paid PFTC $169,812 for these services.

The fund has entered into an arrangement with PFTC whereby credits
realized as a result of uninvested cash balances are used to reduce a
portion of the fund's expenses. For the six months ended April 30, 2005,
the fund's expenses were reduced by $33,405 under these arrangements.

Each independent Trustee of the fund receives an annual Trustee fee, of
which $756, as a quarterly retainer, has been allocated to the fund, and
an additional fee for each Trustees meeting attended. Trustees receive
additional fees for attendance at certain committee meetings.

The fund has adopted a Trustee Fee Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan")
which allows the Trustees to defer the receipt of all or a portion of
Trustees fees payable on or after July 1, 1995. The deferred fees remain
invested in certain Putnam funds until distribution in accordance with
the Deferral Plan.

The fund has adopted an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit pension
plan (the "Pension Plan") covering all Trustees of the fund who have
served as a Trustee for at least five years. Benefits under the Pension
Plan are equal to 50% of the Trustee's average total retainer and
meeting fees for the three years preceding retirement. Pension expense
for the fund is included in Trustee compensation and expenses in the
statement of operations. Accrued pension liability is included in
Payable for Trustee compensation and expenses in the statement of assets
and liabilities. The Trustees have terminated the Pension Plan with
respect to any Trustee first elected after 2003.

Note 3
Purchases and sales of securities

During the six months ended April 30, 2005, cost of purchases and
proceeds from sales of investment securities other than short-term
investments aggregated $78,711,917 and $79,971,505, respectively. There
were no purchases or sales of U.S. government securities.

Note 4
Preferred shares

The Series A (550), Series B (550) and Series C (650) shares are
redeemable at the option of the fund on any dividend payment date at a
redemption price of $100,000 per share, plus an amount equal to any
dividends accumulated on a daily basis but unpaid through the redemption
date (whether or not such dividends have been declared) and, in certain
circumstances, a call premium.

It is anticipated that dividends paid to holders of remarketed preferred
shares will be considered tax-exempt dividends under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986. To the extent that the fund earns taxable income
and capital gains by the conclusion of a fiscal year, it may be required
to apportion to the holders of the remarketed preferred shares
throughout that year additional dividends as necessary to result in an
after-tax equivalent to the applicable dividend rate for the period.

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is required to
maintain asset coverage of at least 200% with respect to the remarketed
preferred shares as of the last business day of each month in which any
such shares are outstanding. Additionally, the fund is required to meet
more stringent asset coverage requirements under terms of the remarketed
preferred shares and the shares' rating agencies. Should these
requirements not be met, or should dividends accrued on the remarketed
preferred shares not be paid, the fund may be restricted in its ability
to declare dividends to common shareholders or may be required to redeem
certain of the remarketed preferred shares. At April 30, 2005, no such
restrictions have been placed on the fund.

Note 5
Regulatory matters and litigation

Putnam Management has entered into agreements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts Securities Division settling
charges connected with excessive short-term trading by Putnam employees
and, in the case of the charges brought by the Massachusetts Securities
Division, by participants in some Putnam-administered 401(k) plans.
Pursuant to these settlement agreements, Putnam Management will pay a
total of $193.5 million in penalties and restitution, with $153.5
million being paid to shareholders and the funds. The restitution amount
will be allocated to shareholders pursuant to a plan developed by an
independent consultant, with payments to shareholders currently expected
by the end of the summer.

The SEC's and Massachusetts Securities Division's allegations and
related matters also serve as the general basis for numerous lawsuits,
including purported class action lawsuits filed against Putnam
Management and certain related parties, including certain Putnam funds.
Putnam Management will bear any costs incurred by Putnam funds in
connection with these lawsuits.  Putnam Management believes that the
likelihood that the pending private lawsuits and purported class action
lawsuits will have a material adverse financial impact on the fund is
remote, and the pending actions are not likely to materially affect its
ability to provide investment management services to its clients,
including the Putnam funds.


Compliance certifications
(Unaudited)

On November 11, 2004, your fund submitted a CEO annual certification to
the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") on which the fund's principal
executive officer certified that he was not aware, as of that date, of
any violation by the fund of the NYSE's Corporate Governance listing
standards.  In addition, as required by Section 302 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC rules, the fund's principal
executive and principal financial officers have made quarterly
certifications, included in filings with the SEC on Forms N-CSR and N-Q,
relating to, among other things, the fund's disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting.

1. I have reviewed each report on Form N-CSR of the funds listed on
Attachment A:

2. Based on my knowledge, each report does not contain any untrue statements
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by each report;

3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in each report, fairly present in all material respects

each report;

4. The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for

Investment Company Act of 1940) for the registrant and have:

a) designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which each report is being
prepared;

b) designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such
internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our
supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the

over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent
fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial
reporting; and

registrant's auditors and the audit committee of each registrant's board of
