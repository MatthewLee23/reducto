1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC and
the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (collectively the "Funds" and
individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of Delaware as limited liability
companies. The Funds are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end, non-diversified, management investment
companies. Each of the Funds is a fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital
appreciation by allocating their assets among a select group of private
investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds) ("Portfolio Funds") that
utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies specific for each Fund to
produce an attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent
of the various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes. Aetos
Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the Investment Manager to the Funds.

The Funds operate under a master fund/feeder fund structure. Feeder Funds invest
substantially all of their investable assets in the Funds. As of July 31, 2008
the Feeder Funds' beneficial ownership of their corresponding Master Funds'
members' capital are 68%, 71%, 71%, 70% and 80% for the Aetos Capital
Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Cayman Fund, Aetos
Capital Market Neutral Strategies Cayman Fund and Aetos Capital Opportunities
Cayman Fund, respectively.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of market neutral
strategies.

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Opportunities Fund") seeks capital
appreciation by investing its assets among a select group of alternative asset
managers employing different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of
attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital.

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current


                                       19

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions (continued)

market exchange and the differences could be material to the financial
statements. The use of different factors or estimation methodologies could have
a significant effect on the estimated fair value.

Realized gains and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the
identified cost basis. Investments are recorded on the effective date of the
subscription in the Portfolio Fund.

In September, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 157, which provides
enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. The
Funds adopted SFAS No. 157 on February 1, 2008. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair
value hierarchy and specifies that a valuation technique used to measure fair
value shall maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs. The objective of a fair value measurement is to determine
the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date (an exit price). Accordingly, the fair value hierarchy gives
the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
under SFAS No. 157 are described below:

     -    Level 1 -- Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical,
          unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Fund has the ability to
          access at the measurement date;

     -    Level 2 -- Quoted prices which are not active, or inputs that are
          observable (either directly or indirectly) for substantially the full
          term of the asset or liability; and

     -    Level 3 -- Prices, inputs or exotic modeling techniques which are both
          significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
          by little or no market activity).

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions (continued)

As required by SFAS No.157, investments are classified within the level of the
lowest significant input considered in determining fair value. Investments
classified within Level 3 consider several inputs and may include Level 1 or
Level 2 inputs as components of the overall fair value measurement. The table
below sets forth information about the level within the fair value hierarchy at
which the Funds' investments are measured at July 31, 2008:

C. Fund Income and Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and consists of interest earned
on cash and cash equivalents.

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to continue to be treated as a partnership for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit
relating to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. The Funds withhold and pay taxes on U.S.
source income and U.S. effectively connected income, if any, allocated from
Portfolio Funds to the extent such income is not exempted from withholding under
the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations thereunder. The actual amount of such
taxes is not known until all Form K-1s from Portfolio Funds are received,
usually in the

D. Income Taxes (continued)

following tax year. Prior to the final determination the amount of tax is
estimated based on information available. The final tax could be different from
the estimated tax and the difference could be significant. Such withholdings are
listed as distributions in the Statements of Changes in Members' Capital, and
are allocated to the individual Members' Capital accounts to which they apply.

E. Distribution Policy

The Funds have no present intention of making periodic distributions of their
net investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and
frequency of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of
the Board.

F. Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G. Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Funds treat all highly liquid financial instruments that mature within three
months as cash equivalents.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.

The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the Opportunities Fund) of
each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May 31, 2008. Effective
June 1, 2008, the expense limitation for the Funds has been terminated.

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an

investor's assets in the Funds. The Investment Manager may also be paid an
annual performance-based incentive fee outside of the Funds based on the return
of an investor's account with the Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of 0.12% on the first $250 million of net
assets, 0.10% on net assets between $250 million and $500 million and 0.08% on
net assets over $500 million, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.
Each Fund also pays the Custodian $3,000 annually to act as qualified Custodian
for its Cayman feeder fund.

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act receives an annual retainer of $32,000 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $3,250 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee receives an additional annual
retainer of $1,900. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interests in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

5. CONCENTRATION OF RISK

The Funds invest primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques that may
involve significant risks. Such risks include those related to the volatility of
the equity, credit and currency markets, the use of leverage associated with
certain fixed income strategies, derivative contracts and in connection with
short positions, the potential illiquidity of certain instruments, and
counterparty and broker arrangements. These Portfolio Funds may invest a high
percentage of their assets in specific sectors of the market in order to achieve
a potentially greater investment return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be
more susceptible to economic, political, and regulatory developments in a
particular sector of the market, positive or negative, and may experience
increased volatility of the Portfolio Funds' net asset value. The Funds invest
in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may result in
additional risk.

Various risks are also associated with an investment in the Funds, including
risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the Funds, risks relating to
compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of
Interests.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

9. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

The Funds adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48 "ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN
INCOME TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109" ("FIN 48"), as
required, on February 1, 2007. FIN 48 requires the Investment Manager to
determine whether a tax position of a Fund is more likely than not to be
sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including
resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the
technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured
as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of
being realized upon ultimate settlement which could result in the Fund recording
a tax liability that would reduce net assets. FIN 48 must be applied to all
existing tax positions upon initial adoption and the cumulative effect, if any,
is to be reported as an adjustment to net assets as of February 1, 2007.

Based on its analysis, the Investment Manager has determined that the adoption
of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Funds' financial statements.
However, the Investment Manager's conclusions regarding FIN 48 may be subject to
review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not
limited to, further implementation guidance expected from the FASB, and on-going
analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

                   Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements

                                  July 31, 2008
                                   (Unaudited)

At a meeting held in person on July 24, 2008, the Board of Managers of each
Fund, including the independent board members (the "Boards"), discussed the
materials previously provided to them and reviewed the nature, quality and scope
of the services provided to the Funds by Aetos. The Boards considered the impact
of Mr. James Allwin's death on Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC (the
"Investment Manager") and the services to be provided by the Investment Manager,
including the change in the ownership structure of the Investment Manager and
the need to consider potential future changes in the Investment Manager's
ownership structure. The Boards discussed the materials provided to them prior
to the meeting and reviewed the nature, quality and scope of the services
provided to each Fund by the Investment Manager. The Boards also considered the
fees charged under the original investment advisory agreements and interim
investment advisory agreements (together, the "Investment Advisory Agreements")
and proposed to be charged under the Successor Investment Advisory Agreements,
as well as each Fund's performance, and reviewed the comparative fee and
performance data previously provided by the Investment Manager. They also
considered the information provided by the Investment Manager regarding the
Investment Manager's financial performance and profitability. The Boards
reviewed reports from third parties and the Investment Manager about the
foregoing factors. In considering the approval of the Successor Investment
Advisory Agreement for each Fund, the Board members gave particular
consideration to the following factors:

NATURE, EXTENT AND QUALITY OF SERVICES

The Board of each Fund reviewed and considered the nature and extent of the
investment advisory services previously provided by the Investment Manager to
the Funds under the Investment Advisory Agreements, and proposed to be provided
under the Successor Investment Advisory Agreements, including the selection of
underlying hedge funds ("Portfolio Funds"), allocation of each Fund's assets
among, and monitoring performance of, Portfolio Funds, evaluation of risk
exposure of Portfolio Funds and reputation, experience and training of Portfolio
Funds' investment managers ("Portfolio Managers"), management of short-term cash
and operations of each Portfolio Fund, and day-to-day portfolio management and
general due diligence examination of Portfolio Funds before and after committing
assets of each Fund for investment. The Boards also reviewed and considered the
nature and extent of the non-advisory, administrative services provided by the
Investment Manager under the Investment Advisory Agreements, including, among
other things, providing to each Fund office facilities, equipment and personnel.
The Boards also reviewed and considered the qualifications of the portfolio
managers, the senior administrative managers and other key personnel of the
Investment Manager who provide the investment advisory and administrative
services to each Fund. The Boards considered the impact of Mr. Allwin's death on
the Investment Manager and the services to be provided by the Investment
Manager.

             Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements (continued)

The Boards determined that the Investment Managers' portfolio managers and key
personnel are well qualified by education and/or training and experience to
perform the services in an efficient and professional manner. The Boards
concluded that the overall quality of the advisory and administrative services
was satisfactory.

PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPARABLE FUNDS MANAGED BY OTHER ADVISERS

The Boards reviewed the performance of each Fund based on information provided
by the Investment Manager that showed each Fund's return for its most recent
fiscal year as compared to the return of other comparable registered
funds-of-hedge-funds for their most recent fiscal years. The Boards considered
each Fund's positive performance since inception and the relative lack of
correlation of such performance to fixed income or equity indices generally or
to any one Portfolio Fund, and the relatively low level of performance
volatility of the Funds. The Boards concluded that each Fund's performance was
satisfactory.

FEES AND EXPENSES RELATIVE TO COMPARABLE FUNDS MANAGED BY OTHER ADVISERS

The Boards reviewed the management fee rate (the "Management Fee") and total
expense ratio of each Fund. The Boards also reviewed the annual separate program
(the "Program") fee of up to 0.50% and the performance fee of up to 10% of
aggregate Program net profits above the return of the 90 day Treasury Bill (the
"Incentive Fee") payable to the Investment Manager by investors in the Funds.
The Boards noted that the Investment Manager had contractually agreed to cap
"other expenses," other than extraordinary or non-recurring expenses, at 0.25%
(0.35% with respect to the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC) at least until
May 31, 2008, so that the net expenses (excluding the Incentive Fee) do not
exceed (a) 1.50% (1.60% with respect to an investor in the Aetos Capital
Opportunities Fund, LLC) of an investor's average monthly Program assets
(assuming that the maximum Program fee applies), with respect to investors
participating in the Program or (b) 1.00% (1.10% with respect to an investor in
the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC) of an investor's average monthly Fund
assets, with respect to investors investing directly in the Funds. The Boards
also reviewed a report prepared by the Investment Manager comparing the fees
payable by each Fund to those payable by other comparable registered
funds-of-hedge-funds. The Boards noted that the fees payable to the Investment
Manager, including the Program fee and the Incentive Fee, were lower than or
comparable to the fees payable to the advisers of most comparable registered
funds-of-hedge-funds. The Board concluded that each Fund's Management Fee,
Program fee, Incentive Fee and total expense ratio were reasonable and
satisfactory in light of the services provided.

BREAKPOINTS AND ECONOMIES OF SCALE

The Boards reviewed the structure of each Fund's Management Fee schedule under
the Investment Advisory Agreements and noted that it does not include any
breakpoints. The Boards considered that each Fund's Management Fee was 0.75% and
concluded that the fee was sufficiently low that the Boards did not need to
consider adding breakpoints at this time. The Boards also determined that, given
the relative size of each Fund, economies of scale were not a factor that needed
to be considered at this time.

             Approval of Investment Advisory Agreements (concluded)

PROFITABILITY OF ADVISER AND AFFILIATES

The Boards considered and reviewed information concerning the costs incurred and
profits realized by the Investment Manager and its affiliates during the
previous year from the Investment Manager's relationship with each Fund. The
Boards noted that the Funds' investor base consists of sophisticated investors
that are capable of evaluating whether the fees charged and the services
provided by the Investment Manager are appropriate. The Boards noted that the
Investment Manager had become profitable in 2005 for the first time, and that
its profit margins had not been substantial since that time. Based on their
review of the information they received, the Boards concluded that the profits
earned by the Investment Manager and its affiliates were not excessive in light
of the advisory, administrative and other services provided to each Fund.

GENERAL CONCLUSION

After considering and weighing all of the above factors, the Board of each Fund
concluded it would be in the best interest of the Funds and its Members to
approve the Successor Investment Advisory Agreements.

periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
