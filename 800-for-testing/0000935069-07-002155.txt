- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                    PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2007 TO JUNE 30, 2007
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   ORGANIZATION

     UBS Technology  Partners,  L.L.C. (the "Fund") was initially organized as a
     limited partnership under the laws of Delaware on December 28, 1998 and was
     subsequently  reorganized as a limited  liability company effective October
     15, 2002. The Fund is registered under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,
     as amended (the "1940 Act"), as a closed-end,  non-diversified,  management
     investment company.  The Fund's investment objective is to maximize capital
     appreciation over the long-term.  The Fund pursues its investment objective
     by  deploying  its  assets  primarily  among a select  group  of  portfolio
     managers who invest primarily in, or who have particular  knowledge within,
     the technology  sector.  Generally,  such portfolio  managers conduct their
     investment programs through  unregistered  investment funds  (collectively,
     the  "Investment  Funds") in which the Fund invests as a limited partner or
     member along with other investors.  The Fund commenced  operations on April
     1, 1999.

     The Fund's Board of Directors (the "Directors") has overall  responsibility
     to manage and  control  the  business  affairs of the Fund,  including  the
     exclusive  authority to oversee and to  establish  policies  regarding  the
     management,  conduct and  operation of the Fund's  business.  The Directors
     have  engaged  UBS Fund  Advisor,  L.L.C.  (the  "UBSFA" or  "Manager"),  a
     Delaware limited  liability company and the Manager of the Fund, to provide
     investment  advice  regarding the  selection of Investment  Funds and to be
     responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund.

     The Manager is a direct  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS  Americas,  Inc.,
     which is a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of UBS AG,  and is  registered  as an
     investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended.

     Initial and additional applications for interests by eligible investors may
     be accepted at such times as the Manager may  determine  and are  generally
     accepted monthly. The Fund reserves the right to reject any application for
     interests in the Fund.

     The Fund from time to time may offer to  repurchase  interests  pursuant to
     written tenders to Members.  These  repurchases  will be made at such times
     and on such terms as may be determined by the Directors,  in their complete
     and  exclusive  discretion.  The Manager  expects that  generally,  it will
     recommend to the Directors that the Fund offer to repurchase interests from
     Members twice in each year,  near  mid-year and year-end.  Members can only
     transfer or assign their membership interests, or a portion thereof, (i) by
     operation  of  law  pursuant  to  the  death,  bankruptcy,   insolvency  or
     dissolution  of a  Member,  or  (ii)  with  the  written  approval  of  the
     Directors,  which may be  withheld in their sole and  absolute  discretion.
     Such  transfers  may be made even if the balance of the capital  account to
     such transferee is equal to or less than the  transferor's  initial capital
     contribution.

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION

     Net asset value of the Fund is  determined  by or at the  direction  of the
     Manager  as of the close of  business  at the end of any  fiscal  period in
     accordance  with the  valuation  principles  set  forth  below or as may be
     determined  from  time to time  pursuant  to  policies  established  by the
     Directors.

                                                                               5

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     A. PORTFOLIO VALUATION (CONTINUED)

     The Fund's  investments  in  Investment  Funds are subject to the terms and
     conditions of the respective  operating  agreements and offering memoranda,
     as appropriate.  The Fund's  investments in Investment Funds are carried at
     fair value as determined by the Fund's pro-rata  interest in the net assets
     of each  Investment  Fund. All  valuations  utilize  financial  information
     supplied by each  Investment Fund and are net of management and performance
     incentive fees or allocations  payable to the Investment Funds' managers or
     pursuant  to  the  Investment  Funds'  agreements.   The  Fund's  valuation
     procedures  require  the  Manager  to  consider  all  relevant  information
     available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. The Manager and/or the
     Directors  will  consider  such  information  and  consider  whether  it is
     appropriate,  in  light of all  relevant  circumstances,  to  value  such a
     position  at its net asset  value as  reported  or whether  to adjust  such
     value. The underlying investments of each Investment Fund are accounted for
     at fair value as described in each Investment Fund's financial  statements.
     (See Schedule of Portfolio Investments)

     Distributions received or withdrawals from Investment Funds, whether in the
     form of  cash or  securities,  are  first  applied  as a  reduction  of the
     investment's cost.

     B. INCOME RECOGNITION

     Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis. Realized gains and losses
     from  Investment  Fund  transactions  are calculated on the identified cost
     basis.

     C. FUND COSTS

     The Fund bears all expenses  incurred in its business,  including,  but not
     limited to, the  following:  all costs and  expenses  related to  portfolio
     transactions and positions for the Fund's account;  legal fees;  accounting
     and auditing fees;  custodial fees; costs of computing the Fund's net asset
     value;  costs of insurance;  registration  expenses;  certain  organization
     costs; due diligence,  including travel and related  expenses;  expenses of
     meetings of Directors and Members; all costs with respect to communications
     to Members; and other types of expenses approved by the Directors. Offering
     costs are charged to capital as incurred.

     D. INCOME TAXES

     No  provision  for the payment of Federal,  state or local income taxes has
     been provided,  since the Fund is not subject to income tax. Each Member is
     individually  required  to report on its own tax  return  its  distributive
     share of the Fund's taxable income or loss.

                                                                               6

2.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

     Cash and cash  equivalents  consist of monies  invested  in a PNC Bank,  NA
     account  which pays money market rates and are  accounted  for at cost plus
     accrued interest which is included in interest  receivable on the Statement
     of Assets, Liabilities and Members' Capital.

     F. REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS

     From  time to time  the Fund  may  enter  into  repurchase  agreements.  In
     connection  with  such  transactions  it is  the  Fund's  policy  that  its
     Custodian take possession of the underlying collateral securities, the fair
     value of which exceeds the principal amount of the repurchase  transaction,
     including accrued interest,  at all times. If the seller defaults,  and the
     fair value of the collateral declines, realization of the collateral by the
     Fund  may be  delayed  or  limited.  As of June  30,  2007,  there  were no
     outstanding repurchase agreements.

     G. USE OF ESTIMATES

     The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with U.S.  generally
     accepted  accounting  principles requires the Manager to make estimates and
     assumptions  that affect the amounts  reported in the financial  statements
     and accompanying notes. The Manager believes that the estimates utilized in
     preparing  the Fund's  financial  statements  are  reasonable  and prudent;
     however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

3.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

     UBSFA provides certain management and administrative  services to the Fund,
     including,  among other  things,  providing  office space and other support
     services. In consideration for such services, the Fund pays UBSFA a monthly
     management  fee (the  "Fee")  at an  annual  rate of 1% of the  Fund's  net
     assets, excluding assets attributable to the Manager's capital account. The
     Fee is paid to UBSFA out of the  Fund's  assets  and  debited  against  the
     Members'  capital  accounts,  excluding the Manager's  capital  account.  A
     portion of the fee is paid by UBSFA to its affiliates.

     UBS Financial  Services Inc. ("UBS FSI"), a wholly-owned  subsidiary of UBS
     Americas,  Inc.,  acts as a placement  agent for the Fund,  without special
     compensation  from the Fund,  and bears its own costs  associated  with its
     activities  as  placement  agent.   Placement  fees,  if  any,  charged  on
     contributions are debited against the contribution  amounts, to arrive at a
     net subscription  amount.  The placement fee does not constitute  assets of
     the Fund.

     The net increase (or decrease) in members'  capital derived from operations
     (net income or loss) is initially  allocated to the capital accounts of all
     Members  on a  pro-rata  basis,  other  than  the Fee  which  is  similarly
     allocated  to all Members  other than the Manager as  described  above.  In
     accordance with the Limited  Liability  Company  Agreement,  the Manager is
     then allocated an amount based on the

                                                                               7

     performance  of the Fund  (the  "Performance  Bonus")  for the  Measurement
     Period,  as  defined  in the  Confidential  Memorandum  (i.e.,  the  period
     commencing on the admission of a Member to the Fund,  and  thereafter  each
     period  commencing  on the day following  the last  Measurement  Period and
     ending  generally  on the first to occur of (1) a fiscal  year-end or (2) a
     whole  or  partial   redemption).   The  Performance  Bonus  is  calculated
     separately with respect to each Member.

     The Performance Bonus is equal to 1% of the balance of the Member's capital
     account at the end of the Measurement Period, provided that appreciation in
     the Member's  capital  account (net of any  Performance  Bonus) exceeds the
     Member's threshold return. The threshold return is the amount that a Member
     would have earned for a fiscal year if it had received an  annualized  rate
     of return of 20% on its opening capital account  balance,  as adjusted.  No
     Performance  Bonus was earned for the period  from  January 1, 2007 to June
     30, 2007.

     Each Director of the Fund receives a retainer of $7,500 plus a fee for each
     meeting  attended.  All  Directors  are  reimbursed  by the  Fund  for  all
     reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses.  Total  amounts  expensed  by the Fund
     related to  Directors  for the period from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2007
     were $17,009.

     Other investment  partnerships  sponsored by UBS Americas or its affiliates
     may also maintain investment interests in the Investment Funds owned by the
     Fund.

4.   ADMINISTRATION AND CUSTODIAN FEES

     PFPC Trust Company (an affiliate of PNC Bank,  NA) serves as custodian (the
     "Custodian") of the Fund's assets and provides  custodial  services for the
     Fund.

     PFPC Inc. (also an affiliate of PNC Bank, NA) serves as  Administrator  and
     Accounting  Agent  to  the  Fund  and in  that  capacity  provides  certain
     administrative,  accounting,  record  keeping,  tax  and  investor  related
     services.  PFPC Inc.  receives a monthly fee  primarily  based upon (i) the
     average net assets of the Fund,  subject to a minimum monthly fee, and (ii)
     the  aggregate net assets of the Fund and certain  other  investment  funds
     sponsored or advised by UBS Americas, Inc. or it affiliates.  Additionally,
     the Fund reimburses certain out of pocket expenses incurred by PFPC Inc.

5.   CREDIT FACILITY

     Effective  July 1, 2006,  the Fund,  along with other UBS sponsored  funds,
     entered into a $200,000,000  committed,  unsecured revolving line of credit
     with Harris Trust and Savings Bank. Under the most restrictive arrangement,
     the Fund may borrow an amount that  combined  with the other  borrowings of
     the Fund  would not  exceed 20% of its net  assets.  The  Fund's  borrowing
     capacity is also limited to the portion of the unused line of credit at any
     point in time.  The Fund is only  liable  under  the line of  credit to the
     extent of its own borrowing there under. The interest rate on the borrowing
     is based on the  Federal  Funds rate plus 150 basis  points per annum.  The
     expiration  date of such credit  agreements is July 31, 2007. The committed
     facility also  requires a fee to be paid by the Fund, on a pro-rata  basis,
     based on the amount of the aggregate commitment which has not been utilized
     of 25 basis  points per annum.  For the period from January 1, 2007 to June
     30, 2007, the Fund's average interest rate paid on borrowings was 6.75% per
     annum and the average borrowings outstanding were $124,807. The Fund

7.   INVESTMENTS

     As of June 30, 2007, the Fund had investments in Investment  Funds, none of
     which were related  parties.  The Fund's  investments are summarized  below
     based on the investment objectives of the specific Investment Funds at June
     30, 2007.

               Investment Objective             Cost            Fair Value
               --------------------             ----            ----------
                 Long/Short Equity         $155,950,000        $303,092,774

     The  agreements  related to  investments  in  Investment  Funds provide for
     compensation  to the general  partners/managers  in the form of  management
     fees of 1% to 2% (per annum) of net assets and  performance  incentive fees
     or allocations of 20% of net profits earned.

8.   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

     In the normal course of business,  the  Investment  Funds in which the Fund
     invests  trade  various  financial   instruments  and  enter  into  various
     investment  activities with off-balance sheet risk. These include,  but are
     not  limited  to,  short  selling  activities,  writing  option  contracts,
     contracts for  differences,  and equity  swaps.  The Fund's risk of loss in
     these  Investment  Funds is  limited to the value of these  investments  as
     reported by the Fund.

9.   INDEMNIFICATION

     In the ordinary  course of business,  the Fund may enter into  contracts or
     agreements that contain indemnifications or warranties. Future events could
     occur that lead to the  execution  of these  provisions  against  the Fund.
     Based on its history and  experience,  management  feels the  likelihood of
     such an event is remote.

                                                                               9

10.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     On September 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial  Accounting
     Standards  No.  157  "Fair  Value   Measurements"   ("FAS  157").  FAS  157
     establishes an authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a framework
     for  measuring  fair  value,  and  requires  additional  disclosures  about
     fair-value measurements.  The application of FAS 157 is required for fiscal
     years  beginning  after November 15, 2007 and interim  periods within those
     fiscal years.  At this time,  management is evaluating the  implications of
     FAS  157  and its  impact  on the  financial  statements  has not yet  been
     determined.

                                                                              10
