                Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2009
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of
arbitrage strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on
invested capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes.

The Fund includes allocations to event arbitrage and fixed income arbitrage
managers. Event arbitrage managers seek to identify mispricings in securities
that will be resolved through an anticipated event. Events can include mergers,
acquisitions, spinoffs, recapitalizations and bankruptcy (either entering into
bankruptcy or emerging from it). Skills required include the ability to analyze
the relative value of the securities involved and the probability of the event
taking place in a timely manner. Fixed income arbitrage managers seek to
identify discrepancies in the prices of securities that are very closely related
and arbitrage that discrepancy.

For the year ended January 31, 2009, the Fund had a total return of -20.29%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2009, the Fund had an average annual total return of 1.78%.

Our Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund suffered the most of our funds during 2008,
largely reflective of its managers' role as liquidity suppliers to markets and
the severity with which traditional relationships became dislocated. Losses were
suffered overwhelmingly in the last four months of the year. More than other
strategies, these managers were affected by the forced liquidations of their
peers.

For our event-driven managers, losses were related primarily to the global
pullback in corporate activity. Merger arbitrage and equity restructuring
situations saw their timelines pushed out or canceled altogether amid a dearth
of financing and rapidly shrinking revenue projections. In general, these
event-driven managers have shifted their focus from equity to credit
investments.

Our fixed income and convertible arbitrage managers suffered greatly during 2008
as de-leveraging and liquidations ricocheted among corporations, banks and
investors. In particular, convertible arbitrage investors were impacted as hedge
funds, who have increasingly become the principal holders (on a leveraged basis)
of these securities, substantially de-levered during this period. Fortunately,
our exposure to convertible arbitrage was limited to a single manager.

The root of these fixed income dislocations is an unprecedented global
de-leveraging combined with a mentality of extreme conservatism by banks and
investors. We are monitoring these situations closely and we believe the
prospects for future returns are attractive.

            Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2009
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund")
allocates its assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety
of distressed investment strategies while seeking to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes.

The Fund allocates to investment managers that buy the securities (generally
bonds and bank loans) of companies that are in bankruptcy or in danger of
bankruptcy. These managers are able to buy these securities at a discount to
their eventual value because traditional fixed income portfolio managers who
bought the bonds or banks that made the loans may not want to or be able to own
them once they are in default. The sellers may also not have the expertise and
patience to go through a lengthy restructuring process. Distressed investing
involves credit analysis, legal expertise and (often) negotiating ability, as
the portfolio manager must estimate the value of the claims he is buying, the
likely timing and resolution of the bankruptcy process and also may be called
upon to reach agreements with other claimants in order to speed the process.

For the year ended January 31, 2009, the Fund had a total return of -8.57%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2009, the Fund had an average annual total return of 8.19%.

Despite maintaining a cautious approach to the credit markets in 2008, holding
high levels of cash and focusing on the most senior parts of the capital
structure, many of our distressed managers suffered meaningful losses. Although
it is not a consolation, this disappointing performance occurred during the
worst year for credit investments in several generations. For the year, high
yield debt fell 26.4% while leveraged loans actually fell even more despite
being higher in the capital structure. We believe this odd result, like many in
2008, can be chalked up to technical market factors, which led to particularly
severe selling pressures in the loan market.

In general, though, our managers have remained cautious and continue to maintain
sizeable cash balances with the view that 2009 should provide a number of
opportunities in the area of traditional corporate distressed investments. We
see an attractive environment for distressed investing shaping up with a breadth
and depth that is comparable to, or may be even more attractive than, the
opportunities presented during the utilities/telecom bust of 2002. As evidence,
Moody's currently projects a speculative default rate of 15.3% by year-end 2009,
up from 4.0% at the end of 2008 and exceeding the peak levels from the prior two
cycles (1991, 2002). Although we expect the opportunity set to be greater, we
believe this cycle is likely to play out over a longer period of time given the
bleaker economic environment.

                  Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2009
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
long-biased portfolios of stocks, usually based on bottom-up equity research.
These portfolios generally vary from 20% to 40% net long.

For the year ended January 31, 2009, the Fund had a total return of -9.33%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on September 1, 2002
through January 31, 2009, the Fund had an average annual total return of 5.15%.

For our long/short managers, the year can be divided into everything that
happened before the failure of Lehman Brothers on September 15th and everything
that happened afterwards. The first period was marked by turmoil, such as the
near-failure of Bear Stearns in March, but equity markets still behaved
relatively normally. The post-Lehman Brothers period was one of outright panic
in the markets as technical movements drove stocks, rewarding managers with
thematic plays and failing to differentiate between names on a fundamental basis
as longs and shorts often moved roughly in concert. This environment did not set
up well for our managers, who follow a research-intensive approach to company
selection.

During the twelve-month period, the majority of gains were realized on the short
side, with many managers benefiting from weakness in financials, consumer
discretionary and housing-related companies. Losses on the long side were
largest in the energy sector, where managers were caught off guard by the
dramatic and rapid fall in commodity prices beginning in July. Two themes that
worked well on the long side were post-secondary education and healthcare, as
enrollment data accelerated significantly over the year and large, cash-rich
pharmaceutical companies held up better during the flight to safety that
occurred beginning in September.

As we have written in the past, we are not sanguine on the prospects for the
broader equity markets. Even though the S&P 500 has fallen over 50% (inflation
adjusted) since 2000, its Shiller P/E ratio is close to the long-term median and
we expect earnings will be under significant pressure in 2009.

                                 Fund Commentary
                       For the year ended January 31, 2009
                                   (Unaudited)

The Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Fund") allocates its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of opportunistic
strategies while seeking to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. The Fund is composed of managers that operate
smaller-sized, more idiosyncratic portfolios employing directional strategies or
focusing on particular markets or sectors.

For the year ended January 31, 2009, the Fund had a total return of -9.03%.(1)
For the period from commencement of investment activities on May 27, 2005
through January 31, 2009, the Fund had an average annual total return of 1.29%.

Losses were incurred this year primarily due to the Fund's exposure to higher
beta managers, in particular those with energy sector investments and
investments in emerging Asian economies. We were disappointed that these
managers' stock selection did not provide more insulation from falling equity
markets as technical selling pressures often overwhelmed the company-specific
fundamentals. These negative returns were offset somewhat by two managers who
performed very well for 2008, each up more than 25%. One manager was focused on
shorting credit and benefited from the historic widening of credit spreads. The
other manager was long high quality stocks and short low quality stocks and saw
large gains in the fourth quarter as a flight to quality phenomenon occurred in
U.S. equities. We selected these investments with the view that they would serve
as tactical hedges to the portfolio and were pleased that they provided some
offset to an otherwise difficult year for our Opportunities Fund managers.

             Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Board of Managers and Members of the
Aetos Capital Funds:

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedules of investments, and the related statements of operations, changes
in members' capital and of cash flows and the financial highlights present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Aetos Capital
Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment
Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC and Aetos
Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (hereafter referred to as the "Funds") at
January 31, 2009, the results of each of their operations and cash flows for the
year then ended, the changes in each of their members' capital for each of the
two years in the period then ended and the financial highlights for the periods
presented, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. These financial statements and financial highlights
(hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the
Funds' management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of the underlying
portfolio funds at January 31, 2009, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As explained in Note 2, the financial statements include investments held by
Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Distressed
Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC
and Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC valued at $311,411,619 (80.1% of the
Fund's members' capital), $201,571,304 (57.0% of the Fund's members' capital),
$619,393,827 (70.1% of the Fund's members' capital), and $92,107,880 (62.3% of
the Fund's members' capital) respectively, at January 31, 2009, the values of
which have been estimated by the Investment Manager, under general supervision
of the Board of Managers, in the absence of readily ascertainable market values.
Those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have
been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the difference
could be material.

1. ORGANIZATION

The Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital
Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC, the Aetos Capital Long/Short
Strategies Fund, LLC, and the Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC
(collectively the "Funds" and individually a "Fund") were formed in the state of
Delaware as limited liability companies. The Funds are registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as closed-end,
non-diversified, management investment companies. Each of the Funds is a
fund-of-funds. The Funds seek capital appreciation by allocating their assets
among a select group of private investment funds (commonly known as hedge funds)
("Portfolio Funds") that utilize a variety of alternative investment strategies
specific for each Fund to produce an attractive absolute return on invested
capital, largely independent of the various benchmarks associated with
traditional asset classes. Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC serves as the
Investment Manager to the Funds.

The Funds operate under a master fund/feeder fund structure. Feeder Funds invest
substantially all of their investable assets in the Funds. As of January 31,
2009 the Feeder Funds' beneficial ownership of their corresponding Master Funds'
members' capital are 73%, 76%, 76%, and 86% for the Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy
Arbitrage Cayman Fund, Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Cayman
Fund, Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Cayman Fund, and Aetos Capital
Opportunities Cayman Fund, respectively.

The principal investment objective of each Fund is as follows:

Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers that utilize a variety of arbitrage
strategies.

Aetos Capital Distressed Investment Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an
attractive absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the
various benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its
assets among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of distressed
investment strategies.

Aetos Capital Long/Short Strategies Fund, LLC seeks to produce an attractive
absolute return on invested capital, largely independent of the various
benchmarks associated with traditional asset classes, by allocating its assets
among a select group of portfolio managers across a variety of long/short
strategies.

Aetos Capital Opportunities Fund, LLC (the "Opportunities Fund") seeks capital
appreciation by investing its assets among a select group of alternative asset
managers employing different absolute return investment strategies in pursuit of
attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with the preservation of capital.

                                                                              20

1. ORGANIZATION (CONTINUED)

The Funds may offer, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding members'
interests ("Interests") pursuant to written tenders by members. Repurchase
offers will be made at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the
Funds' Board of Managers (the "Board") in its sole discretion. The Funds may
offer to repurchase Interests four times each year, as of the last business day
of March, June, September and December.

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The Funds' financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is
a summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the Funds:

A. Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Investment
Manager to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
from these estimates.

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions

The net asset values of the Funds are determined as of the close of business at
the end of each month in accordance with the valuation principles set forth
below or as may be determined from time to time pursuant to policies established
by the Board.

Investments in Portfolio Funds are presented in the accompanying financial
statements at fair value, as determined by the Funds' Investment Manager under
the general supervision of the Board. Such fair value generally represents a
Fund's pro-rata interest in the net assets of a Portfolio Fund as provided by
the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Manager considers information provided by
the Portfolio Funds regarding the methods they use to value underlying
investments in the Portfolio Funds and any restrictions on or illiquidity of the
interests in the Portfolio Funds, in determining fair value.

Considerable judgment is required to interpret the factors used to develop
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates may not be indicative of the
amounts the Fund could realize in a current market exchange and the differences
could be material to the financial statements. The use of different factors or
estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated fair
value.

                                                                              21

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

B. Portfolio Valuation and Security Transactions (continued)

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements"
("FAS 157") establishes a fair value hierarchy and specifies that a valuation
technique used to measure fair value shall maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The objective of a fair value
measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date (an exit price). Accordingly, the fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest
priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the fair value
hierarchy under FAS 157 are as follows:

     -  Level 1 -- Inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices in active
     markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Funds
     have the ability to access at the measurement date;

     -  Level 2 -- Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
     asset or liability either directly or indirectly, including inputs in
     markets that are not considered to be active;

     -  Level 3 -- Inputs that are unobservable.

Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make
valuation decisions, including assumptions about risk. The Investment Manager
generally uses the capital balance reported by a Portfolio Fund as the primary
input to its valuation; however adjustments to the reported capital balance may
be made based on various factors, including, but not limited to, the attributes
of the interest in the Portfolio Fund held, including the rights and
obligations, and any restrictions on or illiquidity of such interests, and the
fair value of such Portfolio Fund's investment portfolio or other assets and
liabilities.

An individual Portfolio Fund's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on
the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Portfolio Funds classified within Level 3 consider several inputs and may
include Level 1 or Level 2 inputs as components of the overall fair value
measurement.

All of the Funds' investments in Portfolio Funds have been classified within
Level 3, and the Funds generally do not hold any investments that could be
classified as Level 1 or Level 2, as observable prices for investments in
Portfolio Funds are typically not available.

                                                                              22

</TABLE>

Realized gains and losses from Portfolio Fund transactions are calculated on the
identified cost basis. Investments are recorded on the effective date of the
subscription in the Portfolio Fund.

C. Fund Income and Expenses

Each Fund bears its own expenses including, but not limited to: any taxes;
organizational expenses; offering costs; investment-related expenses incurred by
the Funds (e.g., fees and expenses charged by the Portfolio Managers and
Portfolio Funds, placement fees, professional fees, custody and administrative
fees). Most expenses of the Funds can be directly attributed to a particular
Fund. Expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among the
Funds based upon relative net assets or on another reasonable basis.

Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis and consists of interest earned
on cash and cash equivalents.

D. Income Taxes

Each Fund intends to continue to be treated as a partnership for Federal income
tax purposes. Each Member is responsible for the tax liability or benefit
relating to the Member's distributive share of taxable income or loss.
Accordingly, no provision for Federal income taxes is reflected in the
accompanying financial statements. The Funds withhold and pay taxes on U.S.
source income and U.S. effectively connected income, if any, allocated from
Portfolio Funds to the extent such income is not exempted from withholding under
the Internal Revenue Code and Regulations thereunder. The actual amount of such
taxes is not known until all Form K-1s from Portfolio Funds are received,
usually in the following tax year. Prior to the final determination the amount
of tax is estimated based on information available. The final tax could be
different from the estimated tax and the difference could be significant.

                                                                              24

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

D. Income Taxes (continued)

Such withholdings are listed as distributions in the Statements of Changes in
Members' Capital, and are allocated to the individual Members' Capital accounts
to which they apply.

E. Distribution Policy

The Funds have no present intention of making periodic distributions of their
net investment income or capital gains, if any, to Members. The amount and
frequency of distributions, if any, will be determined in the sole discretion of
the Board.

F. Distributions from Portfolio Funds

Distributions from Portfolio Funds will be classified as investment income or
realized gains in the Statements of Operations, or alternatively, as a decrease
to the cost of the investments based on the U.S. income tax characteristics of
the distribution if such information is available. In cases where the tax
characteristics are not available, such distribution will be classified as
investment income.

G. Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents is defined as cash on deposit at financial
institutions, investments in money market funds, and highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less. Each Fund invests its cash in
the SEI Daily Income Trust Government Fund, a money market fund managed by an
affiliate of the Administrator. These holdings are included in the cash and cash
equivalents balance on the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The cost of the
money market funds held at January 31, 2009 equals fair value.

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

The Funds pay the Investment Manager a monthly management fee (the "Management
Fee") at the annual rate of 0.75% of the net asset value of each Fund as of the
last day of the month (before any repurchases of Interests). The Investment
Manager is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services
to the Funds, and for providing various administrative services to the Funds.

The Investment Manager contractually agreed to reimburse the Funds in order to
limit the Funds' other expenses (defined as total operating expenses excluding
the Management Fee) at 0.25% (0.35% in the case of the Opportunities Fund) of
each Fund's average monthly net assets, at least until May 31, 2008. Effective
June 1, 2008, the expense limitation for the Funds has been terminated.

                                                                              25

                   Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. INVESTMENT MANAGER FEE, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER (CONTINUED)

The Investment Manager may also be paid a Program fee outside of the Funds for
services rendered to investors. The Program fee is paid directly by the
investors at an annual rate of up to 0.50% of an investor's assets in the Funds.
The Investment Manager may also be paid an annual performance-based incentive
fee outside of the Funds based on the return of an investor's account with the
Investment Manager.

SEI Investments Global Funds Services (the "Administrator") provides certain
administration, accounting and investor services for the Funds. In consideration
for such services, each Fund pays the Administrator a monthly fee based on
month-end net assets at an annual rate of 0.12% on the first $250 million of net
assets, 0.10% on net assets between $250 million and $500 million and 0.08% on
net assets over $500 million, and will reimburse the Administrator for certain
out-of-pocket expenses.

SEI Private Trust Company acts as custodian (the "Custodian") for the Funds'
assets. In consideration for such services, each Fund pays the Custodian a
monthly fee, based on month-end net assets, at an annual rate of up to 0.01%.
Each Fund also pays the Custodian $3,000 annually to act as qualified Custodian
for its Cayman feeder fund.

Each Member of the Board who is not an "interested person" of the Funds as
defined by the 1940 Act received an annual retainer of $32,000 and regular
quarterly meeting fees of $3,250 per meeting (additional meeting fees are $500
per meeting). The Chairman of the audit committee received an additional annual
retainer of $1,900. Any Manager who is an "interested person" does not receive
any annual or other fee from the Funds. All Managers are reimbursed by the Funds
for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

Net profits or net losses of the Funds for each fiscal period are allocated
among and credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Members as of
the last day of each fiscal period in accordance with each Member's respective
investment percentage for each Fund. Net profits or net losses are measured as
the net change in the value of the net assets of a Fund during a fiscal period,
before giving effect to any repurchases of Interests in the Fund, and excluding
the amount of any items to be allocated among the capital accounts of the
Members of the Fund, other than in accordance with the Members' respective
investment percentages.

4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

In the normal course of business, the Portfolio Funds in which the Funds invest
trade various financial instruments and enter into various investment activities
with off-balance sheet risk. These include, but are not limited to, short
selling activities, writing option contracts, and equity swaps. The Funds' risk
of loss in these Portfolio Funds is limited to the value of these investments
reported by the Portfolio Funds.

                                                                              26

5. FUND MERGER

On November 1, 2008, Aetos Capital Market Neutral Strategies Fund, LLC was
reorganized into Aetos Capital Multi-Strategy Arbitrage Fund, LLC. The value of
the Aetos Capital Market Neutral Fund, LLC on November 1, 2008 was $46,535,603,
which was comprised of $40,692,369 of an investment in a Portfolio Fund,
$5,952,897 of cash, $682,234 of receivable for sale of investments, $9,688 of
interest receivable, $546,873 of redemptions of interests payable, and $254,712
of expenses payable.

6. RISK FACTORS

Limitations on the Funds' ability to withdraw their assets from Portfolio Funds
may limit the Funds' ability to repurchase their Interests. For example, many
Portfolio Funds impose lock-up periods prior to allowing withdrawals, which can
be two years or longer. After expiration of the lock-up period, withdrawals
typically are permitted only on a limited basis, such as monthly, quarterly,
semi-annually or annually. In instances where the primary source of funds to
repurchase Interests will be withdrawals from Portfolio Funds, the application
of these lock-ups and withdrawal limitations may significantly limit the Funds'
ability to repurchase their Interests.

The Fund invests primarily in Portfolio Funds that are not registered under the
1940 Act and invest in and actively trade securities and other financial
instruments using different strategies and investment techniques that may
involve significant risks. Such risks include those related to the volatility of
the equity, credit, and currency markets, the use of leverage associated with
certain fixed income strategies, derivative contracts and in connection with
short positions, the potential illiquidity of certain instruments and
counterparty and broker arrangements.

The Portfolio Funds may invest a higher percentage of their assets in specific
sectors of the market in order to achieve a potentially greater investment
return. As a result, the Portfolio Funds may be more susceptible to economic,
political and regulatory developments in a particular sector of the market,
positive or negative, and may experience increased volatility of the Portfolio
Fund's net asset value.

The Portfolio Funds may invest in securities of foreign companies that involve
special risks and considerations not typically associated with investments in
the United States of America, due to concentrated investments in a limited
number of countries or regions, which may vary throughout the year depending on
the Portfolio Fund. Such concentrations may subject the Portfolio Funds to
additional risks resulting from political or economic conditions in such
countries or regions and the possible imposition of adverse governmental laws or
currency exchange restrictions could cause the securities and their markets to
be less liquid and their prices to be more volatile than those of comparable
U.S. securities.

                                                                              27

                    Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

6. RISK FACTORS (CONTINUED)

The Funds invest in a limited number of Portfolio Funds. Such concentration may
result in additional risk. Various risks are also associated with an investment
in the Funds, including risks relating to the multi-manager structure of the
Fund, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks related to limited
liquidity of the Interests.

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that contain a
variety of representations which provide general indemnifications. Each Fund's
maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve
future claims that may be made against each Fund that have not yet occurred.
However, based on experience, the Funds expect the risk of loss to be remote.

7. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

8. INVESTMENTS

As of January 31, 2009, collectively the Funds had investments in forty-two
Portfolio Funds, none of which were related parties. The following table lists
the Funds' investments in Portfolio Funds as of January 31, 2009. The agreements
related to investments in Portfolio Funds provide for compensation to the
general partners/managers in the form of management fees of 1.0% to 2.0% (per
annum) of the net assets and incentive fees or allocations of 10% to 20% of net
profits earned. The Portfolio Funds provide for periodic redemptions, with
lock-up provisions ranging from 3 months to 3 years from initial investment. The
liquidity provisions shown in the table apply after any applicable lock-up
provisions.

ITEM 7.  DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

                       AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC
                               PROXY VOTING POLICY

I.       INTRODUCTION

         This policy sets forth Aetos Alternatives Management, LLC ("AAM")
         policies and procedures for voting proxies with respect to portfolio
         securities held in the accounts for which AAM provides discretionary
         investment management services and for which AAM has the explicit
         authority to vote their proxies. The policy will be reviewed and, if
         necessary, updated periodically to address new or revised proxy voting
         issues as they arise.

         As an investment manager for various clients, including clients
         governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
         amended ("ERISA"), AAM may vote proxies as part of its authority to
         manage, acquire and dispose of client account assets, unless the "named
         fiduciary" for an ERISA account has explicitly reserved the authority
         for itself, or in the case of an account not governed by ERISA, the

<PAGE>

         client investment management agreement does not provide that AAM will
         vote proxies. When voting proxies for client accounts, AAM will make
         voting decisions solely in the best interests of its clients and its
         ERISA plan clients and beneficiaries and participants, considering all
         relevant factors and without undue influence from individuals or groups
         who may have an economic interest in the outcome of a proxy vote. In
         fulfilling its obligations to its clients, AAM will act in a manner it
         deems prudent and diligent and which is intended to enhance the
         economic value of the underlying portfolio securities held in its
         clients' accounts.

II.      ROUTINE CORPORATE MATTERS

         AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of management
         on matters which are common management-sponsored initiatives, provided
         that, in AAM's opinion, approval of such initiatives will not detract
         from the economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
         accounts. These matters are set out below:

         (i)      Appointment or election of auditors;
         (ii)     Routine elections or re-elections of directors;
         (iii)    Director's liability and indemnification;
         (iv)     General updating/corrective amendments to charter;
         (v)      Name changes;
         (vi)     Elimination of cumulative voting; and
         (vii)    Elimination of preemptive rights.

III.     ISSUES HAVING THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR ECONOMIC IMPACT

         A.       AAM will generally, although not always, vote in support of
                  management initiatives which may have a substantive financial
                  or best interest impact, provided that, in AAM's opinion,
                  approval of such initiatives will not detract from the
                  economic value of the company's securities held in AAM client
                  accounts. These matters are set out below:

                  (i)     Capitalization changes which eliminate other classes
                          of stock and voting rights;
                  (ii)    Changes in capitalization authorization for stock
                          splits, stock dividends, and other specified needs
                          which are no more than 50% of the existing
                          authorization;
                  (iii)   Stock purchase plans with an exercise price of not
                          less than 85% of fair market value;
                  (iv)    Stock option plans that are incentive based and not
                          excessive;
                  (v)     Other stock-based plans which are appropriately
                          structured;
                  (vi)    Reductions in supermajority vote requirements; and
                  (vii)   Adoption of anti-greenmail provisions.

         B.       AAM will generally not vote in support of management on
                  certain issues which have a potential substantive financial or
                  best interest impact when AAM believes that approval of the
                  proposal may negatively impact the economic value of the
                  company's securities held in AAM client accounts. These
                  matters are set out below:

                  (i)     Capitalization changes which add classes of stock
                          which are blank check in nature or that dilute the
                          voting interests of existing shareholders;
                  (ii)    Changes in capitalization authorization where
                          management does not offer an appropriate rationale or
                          that are contrary to the best interest of existing
                          shareholders;
                  (iii)   Anti-takeover and related provisions which serve to
                          prevent the majority of shareholders from exercising
                          their rights or effectively deter appropriate tender
                          offers and other offers;
                  (iv)    Amendments to by-laws which would require
                          supermajority shareholder votes to pass or repeal
                          certain provisions;
                  (v)     Classified boards of directors;
                  (vi)    Reincorporation into a state which has more stringent
                          anti-takeover and related provisions;

<PAGE>
                  (vii)   Shareholder rights plans which allow appropriate
                          offers to shareholders to be blocked by the board or
                          trigger provisions which prevent legitimate offers
                          from proceeding;
                  (viii)  Excessive compensation or non-salary compensation
                          related proposals;
                  (ix)    Change-in-control provisions in non-salary
                          compensation plans, employment contracts and severance
                          agreements that benefit management and would be costly
                          to shareholders if triggered; and
                  (x)     "Other business as properly comes before the meeting"
                          proposals which give a blank check to those acting as
                          proxy.

IV.      SOCIAL AND CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ISSUES

         AAM, believing that management's job is to handle ordinary business
         matters, and not wanting to arbitrarily impose a judgment on such
         matters, usually votes with management on these proposals. Third party
         analyses of these issues are taken into account. If an issue will, in
         our view negatively impact the investment merits of a company, we will
         oppose it.

V.       CONFLICT OF INTERESTS

         Situations may arise where there are material conflicts between AAM's
         interest and those of its advisory clients. AAM may resolve potential
         conflicts by using any of the following methods: (1) adopting a policy
         of disclosing the conflict to clients and obtaining their consent
         before voting: (2) basing the proxy vote on pre-determined voting
         guidelines if the application of the guidelines to the matter do not
         involve the exercise of discretion on the part of AAM; or (3) using the
         recommendations of an independent third party.

VI.      PROXY VOTING RECORD RETENTION

         AAM retains the following records: (1) proxy voting policies and
         procedures; (2) proxy statements; (3) records of votes cast on behalf
         of clients; (4) records of clients' requests for proxy voting
         information; and (5) any documents prepared by or on behalf of AAM that
         were material in making decisions on how to vote. AAM retains the
         above-mentioned records for a minimum of five years.

VII.     PROXY ADMINISTRATION

         AAM's internal Proxy Committee (the "Committee") develops the firm's
         positions on all major corporate issues, creates guidelines, and
         oversees the voting process. The Committee, comprised of the Chief
         Investment Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and General Counsel,
         analyzes types of proposals based on whether they would adversely
         affect shareholder's interests and make a company less attractive to
         own. In evaluating proxy proposals each year, the Committee relies upon
         our own knowledge of each company and its management, independent
         research provided by third parties, and information presented by
         company managements and shareholder groups.

         Once the Committee establishes its recommendations, they are
         distributed to AAM's Portfolio Management Group as voting guidelines.
         Ultimately, the investment professional primarily accountable for a
         portfolio is responsible for votes on companies in that portfolio. Most
         vote consistent with AAM's guidelines. Occasionally, some will take an
         independent view on certain issues and vote differently. When an
         investment professional casts votes which are counter to the
         Committee's guidelines, they are required to document their reasons in
         writing for the Committee. Annually, the Board of Managers of the AAM
         Funds will review AAM's proxy voting process, policies, and voting
         records.

MATERIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

The Investment Manager manages multiple accounts for multiple clients. In
addition to the Funds, these other accounts may include separate accounts,
collective trusts, or offshore funds. The Investment Manager manages potential
conflicts between funds or with other types of accounts through allocation
policies and procedures, internal review processes, and oversight by directors
and independent third parties. The Investment Manager has developed trade
allocation procedures and controls to ensure that no one client, regardless of
type, is intentionally favored at the expense of another. Allocation policies
are designed to address potential conflicts in situations where two or more
funds or accounts participate in investment decisions involving the same
securities.

(a)(3)

DESCRIPTION OF COMPENSATION

Professionals employed by the Investment Manager are subject to a compensation
structure that includes base salary and a discretionary bonus. Bonuses are
variable and depend on many factors, including firm, business unit and

<PAGE>

individual performance relative to established benchmarks and criteria.
Individuals that consistently exceed performance objectives are eligible for
promotions and/or equity participation in the firm. Officers are also eligible
to share in the net profits of the business under a profit participation plan.
Participation amounts are determined on the basis of performance and
contribution. In addition, all managing directors of the Investment Manager have
a common equity membership in Aetos Capital, LLC.

<TEXT>

                     CODE OF ETHICS FOR COVERED OFFICERS OF
       INVESTMENT COMPANIES ADVISED BY AETOS ALTERNATIVES MANAGEMENT, LLC

The Board of Managers of each registered investment company listed on Schedule A
hereto (each a "Fund" and  collectively,  the "Funds") has adopted the following
Code of Ethics (the "Code") applicable to its President and Treasurer  ("Covered
Officers") of Funds advised by Aetos Alternatives  Management,  LLC ("Aetos") to
ensure the continuing  integrity of financial  reporting and  transactions.  The
Covered Officers covered by the Code are listed on Schedule B hereto.

I.    SEPARATE CODE

This Code is the sole  code of ethics  adopted  by the  Funds  for  purposes  of
Section  406 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002.  Insofar  as any other code of
ethics previously adopted by Aetos sets forth the fundamental principles and key
policies  and  procedures  that govern the  conduct of all of Aetos'  employees,
including the Covered Officers,  such prior code of ethics is superceded by this
Code to the extent that such principles,  policies and procedures  conflict with
the  provisions  of this Code.  The Funds' and Aetos' codes of ethics under Rule
17j-1 under the Investment  Company Act of 1940 (the  "Investment  Company Act")
are separate  requirements  applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of this  Code.  In  addition  to this Code or any other  code of ethics
previously  adopted by Aetos,  the  Investment  Company  Act and the  Investment
Advisers  Act of 1940 (the  "Advisers  Act") and  rules  promulgated  thereunder
contain many specific provisions designed to protect the Funds from conflicts of
interest and overreaching.  Any conduct by Covered Officers required by specific
Investment  Company Act or Advisers Act  provisions  or the rules  thereunder is
presumed to be in compliance with this Code. Each Covered Officer is accountable
for his or her adherence to this Code and Aetos' policies. Any violation of this
Code by a Covered Officer may result in disciplinary action, including immediate
dismissal.

II.   REQUIREMENTS

All Covered Officers must:

      1.    Engage in and promote  honest and  ethical  conduct,  including  the
            ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between
            personal and professional relationships;

      2.    Act  responsibly  in producing and produce,  full,  fair,  accurate,
            timely, and understandable  disclosure in reports and documents that
            the Funds file  with,  or submit to,  the  Securities  and  Exchange
            Commission  (the "SEC") and in other public  communications  made by
            the Funds;

      3.    Comply with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;

      4.    Promptly  report  suspected   material   violations  of  this  Code,
            including  violations  of securities  laws or other laws,  rules and
            regulations  applicable to the Funds,  to Aetos' General Counsel and
            the Audit Committee; and

      5.    Promote accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered Officer must act with integrity,  including being honest and candid
while still maintaining the confidentiality of information where required by law
or Aetos'  policies,  and place the  interests  of the Funds  before the Covered
Officer's own personal interests.

<PAGE>

Each Covered  Officer is required to  familiarize  himself  with the  disclosure
requirements applicable to each Fund and must not knowingly misrepresent or fail
to disclose, or cause others to misrepresent or fail to disclose, material facts
about a Fund to others,  including,  but not limited to, officers and counsel to
Aetos and the Funds,  and their  respective  independent  managers,  independent
auditors and governmental regulators. Each Covered Officer should, to the extent
appropriate within his area of  responsibility,  consult with other officers and
employees  of the  Funds  and  Aetos  with the  goal of  promoting  full,  fair,
accurate,  timely and understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the
Funds file with, or submit to, the SEC and in other public  communications  made
by the Funds.

It is the  responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with the
standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and regulations.

III.  AVOIDANCE OF CONFLICTS

The  overarching  principle  of this Code is that the  personal  interests  of a
Covered  Officer  should not be placed  improperly  before the  interests of the
Funds. As a result, each Covered Officer must: (i) handle any actual or apparent
conflict  of  interest in an ethical  manner;  (ii) not use his or her  personal
influence  or  personal  relationships  to  influence  investment  decisions  or
financial  reporting  by a  Fund  whereby  the  Covered  Officer  would  benefit
personally  (directly or  indirectly)  to the  detriment of the Fund;  (iii) not
cause a Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the personal benefit of
the  Covered  Officer  rather  than the  benefit of such Fund;  and (iv) not use
material non-public knowledge pertaining to a Fund.

IV.   COMPLIANCE AND ANNUAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Each Fund will follow  certain  procedures in  investigating  and enforcing this
Code,  including,  but not limited to, the  following:  (i) all  violations  and
potential  violations will be reported to the General Counsel of Aetos; (ii) the
General  Counsel of Aetos will take all  appropriate  action to investigate  any
potential  violations;  (iii) if the General Counsel of Aetos  determines that a
violation  has occurred,  he or she will take all  appropriate  disciplinary  or
preventive  action and inform  the Board of  Managers  of the Fund of his or her
