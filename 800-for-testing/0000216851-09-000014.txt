                               Executive Officer


The year 2008 will go down as one of the worst years in history for stock
market returns. The energy sector and Petroleum & Resources Corporation
performed roughly in line with the poor returns of the overall market. The
total return on the net assets of the Fund was -39.8%, whereas the Dow Jones
U.S. Oil and Gas Index (DJOGI) returned -35.8% and the S&P 500 returned -37.0%.
The Fund's energy investments, on average 85.7% of the portfolio, provided a
disappointing -41.2% return.

A Review of 2008
The dramatic increase in energy prices experienced in 2007 accelerated in the
first half of 2008, as the demand for all major forms of energy -- oil, natural
gas, coal, and electricity -- expanded to keep up with world economic growth
and as supplies were constrained by production capacity. It is also believed
that speculation played a part in the rapid price increases, though its direct
role is difficult to pin down. The price of a barrel of oil rose nearly 50% to
$140. Natural gas reached $13.35 per thousand cubic feet (up
80%), and thermal coal hit $132/ton (up 135%). As the economic recession in
this country began to take its toll in July and the credit crisis worsened,
demand for energy began to decline even faster than it had grown, and prices
went into free-fall. By year end, oil was down 68% from its peak to $44.60 per
barrel, despite two announced cuts in production by OPEC totaling 4.2 million
barrels per day. Natural gas producers terminated drilling programs, with an
estimated 300 rigs ceasing work by the end of December. Many drilling programs
were too far along to stop, however, resulting in a steady rise in the amount
of gas going into storage and in even lower prices.

In the first six months of 2008, the impact of increasing energy prices was
seen in the 10.1% rise in the DJOGI despite an 11.6% decline in the S&P 500.
Earnings expectations for energy companies were not rising as fast as the
prices of the commodities because production costs were also rising rapidly,
thus containing stock price increases. When commodity prices fell in the second
half, energy stocks sold off rapidly, down 25% in the third quarter and another
22% in the final quarter.

The principal difference between the Fund's performance and the return of the
DJOGI is the weighting of the integrated oil companies such as Exxon Mobil and
Chevron. The DJOGI had an average weighting of 52.1% for the integrated
companies during the year compared to the Fund's 36.6%. Our holdings of
integrated companies returned -27.1%, whereas the DJOGI's holdings returned
- -23.4%. During periods of rising commodity prices, the large integrated
companies often do not perform as well as more commodity-leveraged companies,
and the heavy weighting drags down the performance of the DJOGI. In 2008,
though, with rapidly falling commodity prices in the second half of the year,
the integrated oil companies held up better than other segments of the
industry. Thus, like most investors in the sector, Petroleum & Resources'
performance trailed that of the DJOGI.

The exploration and production companies in the portfolio, with an average
weighting of 17.6%, performed better than the E&P companies in the DJOGI,
returning -31.3% compared to the -40.6% return of the index companies. Within
the oil services segment, the Fund's equipment and services stocks performed in
line with the sub-sector of the DJOGI. Our drilling stocks underperformed by
3.6%, with an absolute return of -65.5%. The utilities in the portfolio were
beneficial to our relative performance, with a return of -32.8%. Our holdings
of coal stocks outperformed the coal producers in the Dow Jones U.S. Basic
Materials Index (DJBMI) and our chemicals holdings performed in line with the
chemicals sub-sector of the DJBMI.

INVESTMENT RESULTS
Net assets of the Corporation on December 31, 2008 were $538,936,942 or $22.49
per share on 23,958,656 shares outstanding. This compares with $978,919,829 or
$42.99 per share on 22,768,250 shares outstanding a year earlier.

Net investment income for 2008 was $9,651,706 compared to $10,070,758 for 2007.
These earnings are equivalent to $0.43 and $0.46 per share, respectively, on
the average number of shares outstanding throughout each year. Our expense
ratio (expenses to average net assets) for 2008 was 0.51% compared to 0.54% for
2007 and was once again at a low level compared to the industry.

Net realized gains amounted to $57,867,203 during the year, while the
unrealized appreciation on investments decreased from $606,901,290 at
December 31, 2007 to $151,455,732 at year end.

DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
Total dividends and distributions paid in 2008 were $2.99 per share compared to
$4.31 in 2007. The table on page 18 shows the history of our dividends and
distributions over the past fifteen years, including the annual rate of
distribution as a percentage of the average daily market price of the
Corporation's Common Stock. In 2008, the annual rate of distribution was 8.88%
compared to 11.61% in 2007. As announced on November 13, 2008, a year-end
distribution consisting of investment income of $0.08 per share and capital
gains of $2.52 per share was made on December 27, 2008, both realized and
taxable in 2008. On January 8, 2009, an additional distribution of $0.13 per
share was declared to shareholders of record February 13, 2009, payable
March 1, 2009, representing undistributed net investment income and capital
gains earned in 2008 and an initial distribution from 2009 net investment
income, taxable to shareholders in 2009.

OUTLOOK FOR 2009
With the domestic economy as well as those of many other countries in
recession, it is unlikely that the fundamentals of supply and demand in the
energy industry will change much during 2009. With refineries operating at
about 85% of capacity, there is ample crude oil to meet their needs. The
refineries do not need to operate at higher levels because there is plenty of
gasoline, diesel, and heating oil to satisfy consumer and industrial demand.
The second production cut by the members of OPEC, announced in December, will
begin to be felt in deliveries in February, assuming the producers have the
discipline to follow through. Given the budgetary constraints of many OPEC
countries, their cutting back is in question. Until the worldwide economy
resumes its growth, we expect that oil prices will remain in the $40-$50 range,
with possible spikes both up and down depending on factors such as increased
Iraqi production, a resumption of the conflict in Israel, and further
significant cuts from the OPEC cartel.

Our expectation is that the stimulus programs being put together by governments
around the world will begin to have an effect on their economies in the third
quarter of the year. By the end of the year, economic growth should resume in
this country, but that could be tempered by the timing of recoveries elsewhere.
Depending on how much inventories have been built up by then, it will still
take time to draw them down before prices begin to move up in response to
increased economic activity. Many companies have announced that projects to
build productive capacity have been shelved in this period of lower prices in
order to conserve cash. Until adequate returns can be earned on such projects,
and in some cases financing is made available, those projects will not go
forward, and we will once again find ourselves in short supply with little or
no surplus capacity. Over a period of two to three years, we could see the
price of oil rise significantly, depending on how responsive the world economy
is to stimulus. Alternative fuels, hybrid vehicle use, and higher fuel
efficiency in the transportation sector are also likely to impact the demand
for oil in the intermediate term.

The situation with natural gas is much the same as that with oil, but is more
dependent on domestic actions. As mentioned, the number of gas-oriented rigs in
operation, both onshore and offshore the U.S., has declined. We expect that the
number will decline much further, but gas production is still climbing at a
rate approaching 10% due to drilling completions. This can be seen in the
weekly storage statistics, which show much less draw than normal for the
relatively cold weather experienced thus far this winter. With an expected
rapid response to the drilling decline, production is expected to flatten out
by mid-year. Depending on the weather, storage facilities are likely to be
filled well above historic levels by that time. As with oil, production will
have to be flat to down for several months before prices can strengthen. We
therefore expect that natural gas prices will remain in the $4-$5 range for
most of the year. There is very little impact that liquefied natural gas (LNG)
will have on the domestic situation. Prices overseas, particularly in Europe,
are higher than in the U.S., attracting most of the cargoes coming out of
Middle East and Far East LNG-exporting facilities. We do anticipate that, due
to the natural production decline rates of gas-producing fields in the U.S. and
increased economic activity, drilling will have to pick up by 2010 in order to
satisfy domestic demand. Then gas prices will strengthen again.

The coal industry benefited in 2008 from strong export markets for both
metallurgical (for steel-making) and thermal/steam coal (for electricity
generation). Further, in 2008 nuclear electricity-generating stations were
closed in Japan, Australian ports were having logistical problems, and there
was strong demand for steel in China for the Olympics on top of everything
else. The second half of 2008 saw the end of most of these extraordinary demand

                                                                             3

drivers, and coal prices fell as sharply as crude oil and natural gas prices.
Most coal producers have a good percentage of their 2009 production under
contract, though not at the spot prices of six months ago. They should
therefore do reasonably well until their current contracts are fulfilled.

At this time, the prices of energy and basic materials stocks reflect spot
prices of commodities and large earnings declines for 2009. Current weak
conditions, combined with the possibility of legislation favoring alternative
fuels and carbon reductions, have seemingly outweighed any longer term
potential recovery of commodity prices, earnings, and reserve values. We
believe, however, that there is a solid long-term outlook for traditional
energy companies. Therefore, while we have made some sales to reflect current
conditions, we are looking for opportunities to invest the Fund's cash in these
areas. In addition, companies involved in alternative sources of energy may, at
some point, become profitable without subsidies and thus attractive for
investment, so we are keeping a close eye on them.

Historically, the benchmark against which we have measured the Fund's
performance has been a combination of the DJOGI (80%) and the S&P 500 (20%).
Since our holdings in companies active in areas outside the energy sector have
been limited, we have concluded that the inclusion of the S&P 500 in our
benchmark is no longer warranted. In recognition of the Fund's ability to
invest in a wide variety of natural resources, we have decided that a more
appropriate benchmark for the future is a measurement weighted 80% with the Dow
Jones U.S. Oil & Gas Index and 20% with the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials
Index. Basic materials have held a place in the Corporation's portfolio in the
past, but the allocation has typically been well below 20%. It is our view that
the raw materials required for infrastructure building and industrial
production will experience price recoveries as the economic stimulus plans
become a reality, and this will make basic materials companies such as chemical
and mining companies attractive investments. Therefore, we are likely to place
more emphasis on basic materials companies.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On December 11, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase by
management of up to 6% of the outstanding shares of the Corporation over the
ensuing year. The repurchase program is subject to the restriction that shares
can only be repurchased when the discount of the market price of the shares
from the net asset value is 6.5% or greater.

From the beginning of 2009 through January 23, 2009, 60,400 shares have been
repurchased at a total cost of $1,187,136 and a weighted average discount from
net asset value of 10.0%.

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (the Corporation) is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 as a non-diversified investment company. The
Corporation is an internally-managed fund emphasizing petroleum and other
natural resource investments. The investment objectives of the Corporation are
preservation of capital, the attainment of reasonable income from investments,
and an opportunity for capital appreciation.

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which
require the use of estimates made by Corporation management. Management
believes that estimates and security valuations are appropriate; however,
actual results may differ from those estimates, and the security valuations
reflected in the financial statements may differ from the value the Corporation
ultimately realizes upon sale of the securities.

Security Transactions and Investment Income -- Investment transactions are
accounted for on the trade date. Gain or loss on sales of securities and
options is determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income and
distributions to shareholders are recognized on the ex-dividend date, and
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis.

Security Valuation -- Investments in securities traded on national security
exchanges are valued at the last reported sale price on the day of valuation.
Over-the-counter and listed securities for which a sale price is not available
are valued at the last quoted bid price. Short-term investments (excluding
purchased options and money market funds) are valued at amortized cost, which
approximates fair value. Purchased and written options are valued at the last
quoted bid and asked price, respectively. Money market funds are valued at net
asset value on the day of valuation.

The Corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standard Board Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements ("FAS 157"),
effective January 1, 2008. There was no impact on the fair value of assets
individually or in aggregate upon adoption. In accordance with FAS 157, fair
value is defined as the price that the Corporation would receive upon selling
an investment in an orderly transaction to an independent buyer. FAS 157
established a three-tier hierarchy to establish classification of fair value
measurements, summarized as follows:

  .   Level 1 -- fair value is determined based on market data obtained from
      independent sources; for example, quoted prices in active markets for
      identical investments,
  .   Level 2 -- fair value is determined using other assumptions obtained from
      independent sources; for example, quoted prices for similar investments,
  .   Level 3 -- fair value is determined using the Corporation's own
      assumptions, developed based on the best information available in the
      circumstances.

The Corporation's investments at December 31, 2008 were classified as follows:

                       ---------------------------------
</TABLE>
* Consists of short-term investments other than money market funds.

2. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

The Corporation's policy is to distribute all of its taxable income to its
shareholders in compliance with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
applicable to regulated investment companies. Therefore, no federal income tax
provision is required. For federal income tax purposes, the identified cost of
securities at December 31, 2008 was $467,566,552, and net unrealized
appreciation aggregated $151,485,555, of which the related gross unrealized
appreciation and depreciation were $240,671,187 and $89,185,632, respectively.
As of December 31, 2008, the tax basis of distributable earnings was $1,375,994
of undistributed ordinary income and $1,202,727 of undistributed long-term
capital gain.

Distributions paid by the Corporation during the year ended December 31, 2008
were classified as ordinary income of $9,486,049 and long-term capital gain of
$57,828,484. In comparison, distributions paid by the Corporation during the
year ended December 31, 2007 were classified as ordinary income of $11,559,594
and long-term capital gain of $81,989,740. The distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from generally
accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, periodic reclassifications are
made within the Corporation's capital accounts to reflect income and gains
available for distribution under income tax regulations. Any

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

income tax-related interest or penalties would be classified as income tax
expense.

3. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

The Corporation's investment decisions are made by a committee of management
and recommendations to that committee are made by the research staff.

Purchases and sales of portfolio securities, other than options and short-term
investments, during the year ended December 31, 2008 were $145,261,038 and
$215,709,864, respectively. Options may be written (sold) or purchased by the
Corporation. For written options, covered calls or collateralized puts require
deposits of securities or cash to be segregated with the custodian to guarantee
delivery or payment if the options are exercised. When the Corporation writes
an option, an amount equal to the premium received by the Corporation is
recorded as a liability and is subsequently adjusted to the current fair value
of the option written. Premiums received from unexercised options are treated
as realized gains from investments on the expiration date. Premiums received
from exercised put options reduce the cost basis of the securities purchased,
and premiums received from exercised call options are added to the proceeds
from the sale of the underlying security in determining whether there is a
realized gain or loss. The Corporation as writer of an option bears the risks
of possible illiquidity of the option markets and the unfavorable change in the
price of the security underlying the written option. The risk associated with
purchasing an option is limited to the premium originally paid for the option.
There were no outstanding option contracts as of December 31, 2008.

Transactions in written covered call and collateralized put options during the
year ended December 31, 2008 were as follows:

5. RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation's non-contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan
covers all employees with at least one year of service. In addition, the
Corporation has a non-contributory nonqualified defined benefit plan which
provides eligible employees with retirement benefits to supplement the
qualified plan. Benefits are based on length of service and compensation during
the last five years of employment.

The funded status of the plans is recognized as an asset (overfunded plan) or a
liability (underfunded plan) in

                                                                             9

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Changes in the prior service costs and
accumulated actuarial gains and losses are recognized as accumulated other
comprehensive income, a component of net assets, in the year in which the
changes occur.

The Corporation uses a December 31 measurement date for its plans.

$369,363 of net losses, for a total of $386,432, will be amortized from
accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost.

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was
$6,435,218 and $5,642,374 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

The assumption used to determine expected long-term return on plan assets was
based on historical and future expected returns of multiple asset classes in
order to develop a risk-free real rate of return and risk premiums for each
asset class. The overall rate for each asset class was developed by combining a
long-term inflation component, the risk-free real rate of return, and the
associated risk premium. A weighted average rate was developed based on those
overall rates and the target asset allocation of the plan.

The asset allocations at December 31, 2008 and 2007, by asset category, were as
follows:

Equity securities included common stock of The Adams Express Company, the
Corporation's non-controlled affiliate, in the amount of $144,866 (3% of total
plan assets) and $241,170 (5% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The primary objective of the Corporation's pension plan is
to provide capital appreciation, current income, and preservation of capital
through a diversified portfolio of stocks and fixed income securities.

The Corporation's policy is to contribute annually to the plans those amounts
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes, plus additional amounts
as the Corporation deems appropriate in order to provide assets sufficient to
meet benefits to be paid to plan participants. The Corporation contributed
$531,208 to the plans in 2008 and anticipates contributions of approximately
$500,000 in 2009.

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service and
certain assumptions, are eligible to be paid in the years indicated:

The Corporation also sponsors a defined contribution plan that covers
substantially all employees. The Corporation expensed contributions to this
plan of $118,460 and $105,301 for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
December 31, 2007, respectively. The Corporation does not provide
postretirement medical benefits.

6. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

Although the Stock Option Plan of 1985 ("1985 Plan") has been discontinued and
no further grants will be made under this plan, unexercised grants of stock
options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2004 and prior years remain
outstanding. The exercise price of the unexercised options and related stock
appreciation rights is the fair market value on date of grant, reduced by the
per share amount of capital gains paid by the Corporation during subsequent
years. All options and related stock appreciation rights terminate 10 years
from date of grant, if not exercised.

A summary of option activity under the 1985 Plan as of December 31, 2008, and
changes during the year then ended is presented below:

</TABLE>

Compensation cost resulting from stock options and stock appreciation rights
granted under the 1985 Plan is based on the intrinsic value of the award,
recognized over the award's vesting period, and remeasured at each reporting
date through the date of settlement. The total compensation cost/(credit)
recognized for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $(341,764).

The 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan ("2005 Plan"), adopted at the 2005
Annual Meeting, permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards and
other stock incentives to key employees and all non-employee directors. The
2005 Plan provides for the issuance of up to 872,639 shares of the
Corporation's Common Stock, including both performance and nonperformance-based
restricted stock. Performance-based restricted stock awards vest at the end of
a specified three year period, with the ultimate number of shares earned
contingent on achieving certain performance targets. If performance targets are
not achieved, all or a portion of the performance-based restricted shares are
forfeited and become available for future grants. Nonperformance-based
restricted stock awards vest ratably over a three year period and
nonperformance-based restricted stock units (granted to non-employee directors)
vest over a one year period. Payment of awards may be deferred, if elected. It
is the current intention that employee grants will be performance-based. The
2005 Plan provides for accelerated vesting in the event of death or retirement.
Non-employee directors also may elect to defer a portion of their cash
compensation, with such deferred amount to be paid by delivery of deferred
stock units. Outstanding awards were granted at fair market value on grant
date. The number of shares of Common Stock which remain available for future
grants under the 2005 Plan at December 31, 2008 is 815,767 shares.

A summary of the status of the Corporation's awards granted under the 2005 Plan
as of December 31, 2008, and changes during the year then ended is presented

on the fair value of the award on grant date (determined by the average of the
high and low price on grant date) and recognized on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period. For those awards with performance conditions,
compensation costs are based on the most probable outcome and, if such goals
are not met, compensation cost is not

                                                                             11

recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. The
total compensation costs for restricted stock granted to employees for the year
ended December 31, 2008 were $393,911. The total compensation costs for
restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors for the year ended
December 31, 2008 were $153,089. As of December 31, 2008, there were total
unrecognized compensation costs of $358,094, a component of additional capital
surplus, related to nonvested equity-based compensation arrangements granted
under the 2005 Plan. Those costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted
average period of 1.56 years. The total fair value of shares vested and issued
during the year ended December 31, 2008 was $137,207.

7. OFFICER AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

The aggregate remuneration paid during the year ended December 31, 2008 to
officers and directors amounted to $2,637,962, of which $345,357 was paid as
fees to directors who were not officers. These amounts represent the taxable
income to the Corporation's officers and directors and therefore differ from
the amounts reported in the accompanying Statement of Operations that are
recorded and expensed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

8. PORTFOLIO SECURITIES LOANED

The Corporation makes loans of securities to approved brokers to earn
additional income. It receives as collateral cash deposits, U.S. Government
securities, or bank letters of credit valued at 102% of the value of the
securities on loan. The market value of the loaned securities is calculated
based upon the most recent closing prices and any additional required
collateral is delivered to the Corporation on the next business day. Cash
deposits are placed in a registered money market fund. The Corporation accounts
for securities lending transactions as secured financing and receives
compensation in the form of fees or retains a portion of interest on the
investment of any cash received as collateral. The Corporation also continues
to receive interest or dividends on the securities loaned. Gain or loss in the
fair value of securities loaned that may occur during the term of the loan will
be for the account of the Corporation. At December 31, 2008, the Corporation
had securities on loan of $76,089,513 and held cash collateral of $76,988,162;
additional collateral was delivered the next business day in accordance with
the procedure described above. The Corporation is indemnified by the Custodian,
serving as lending agent, for loss of loaned securities and has the right under
the lending agreement to recover the securities from the borrower on demand.

9. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities ("FAS 161"), which is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. FAS 161 requires
enhanced disclosures about derivative and hedging activities, including how
such activities are accounted for and their effect on financial position,
performance and cash flows. Application of the standard is not expected to
materially impact the Corporation's financial statements and related
disclosures.

            REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Petroleum & Resources Corporation:

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Petroleum & Resources Corporation
(the "Corporation") at December 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the
year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the
period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in
the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and
financial highlights (hereafter referred to as "financial statements") are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management; our responsibility is to
express an opin
ion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
of these financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation
of securities at December 31, 2008 by correspondence with the custodian and
brokers, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Investment income dividends and capital gains distributions are taken in
additional shares. This chart covers the years 1994-2008. Fees for the
reinvestment of interim dividends are assumed as 2% of the amount reinvested
(maximum of $2.50) and commissions of $0.05 per share. There is no charge for
reinvestment of year-end distributions. No adjustment has been made for any
income taxes payable by stockholders on income dividends or on capital gains
distributions or the sale of any shares. These results should not be considered
representative of the dividend income or capital gain or loss which may be
realized in the future.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This report contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. By their
nature, all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and
actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the
forward-looking statements. Several factors that could materially affect the
Corporation's actual results are the performance of the portfolio of stocks
held by the Corporation, the conditions in the U.S. and international
financial, petroleum and other markets, the price at which shares of the
Corporation will trade in the public markets, and other factors discussed in
the Corporation's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

PRIVACY POLICY

In order to conduct its business, the Corporation, through its transfer agent,
currently American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, collects and maintains
certain nonpublic personal information about our stockholders of record with
respect to their transactions in shares of our securities. This information
includes the stockholder's address, tax identification or Social Security
number, share balances, and dividend elections. We do not collect or maintain
personal information about stockholders whose shares of our securities are held
in "street name" by a financial institution such as a bank or broker.

We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you, our other
stockholders or our former stockholders to third parties unless necessary to
process a transaction, service an account or as otherwise permitted by law.

To protect your personal information internally, we restrict access to
nonpublic personal information about our stockholders to those employees who
need to know that information to provide services to our stockholders. We also
maintain certain other safeguards to protect your nonpublic personal
information.

                                                                             19

                     STOCKHOLDER INFORMATION AND SERVICES
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WE ARE OFTEN ASKED --

How do I invest in Petroleum & Resources?

Petroleum & Resources Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The stock's ticker symbol is "PEO" and may be bought and sold through
registered investment security dealers. Your broker will be able to assist you
in this regard. In addition, stock may be purchased through our transfer agent,
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company's INVESTORS CHOICE Plan (see page 21).

Where do I get information on the stock's price, trading and/or net asset value?

The daily net asset value (NAV) per share and closing market price may be
obtained from our website at www.peteres.com. The daily NAV is also available
on the NASDAQ Mutual Fund Quotation System under the symbol XPEOX. The
week-ending NAV is published on Saturdays in various newspapers.

Petroleum's daily trading is shown in the stock tables of many daily
newspapers, often with the abbreviated form "PetRes." Local newspapers
determine, usually by volume of traded shares, which securities to list. If
your paper does not carry our listing, please telephone the Corporation at
(800) 638-2479 or visit our website.

How do I replace a lost certificate(s) or how do I correct a spelling error on
my certificate?

Your Petroleum stock certificates are valuable documents and should be kept in
a safe place. For tax purposes, keep a record of each certificate, including
the cost or market value of the shares it covers at the time acquired. If a
certificate is lost, destroyed or stolen, notify the transfer agent immediately
so a "stop transfer" order can be placed on the records to prevent an
unauthorized transfer of your certificate. The necessary forms and requirements
to permit the issuance of a replacement certificate will then be sent to you. A
certificate can be replaced only after the receipt of an affidavit regarding
the loss accompanied by an open surety bond, for which a small premium is paid
by the stockholder.

In the event a certificate is issued with the holder's name incorrectly
spelled, a correction can only be made if the certificate is returned to the
transfer agent with instructions for correcting the error. Transferring shares
to another name also requires that the certificate be forwarded to the transfer
agent with the appropriate assignment forms completed and the signature of the
registered owner Medallion guaranteed by a bank or member firm of The New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.

Is direct deposit of my dividend checks available?

Yes, our transfer agent offers direct deposit of your interim dividend and
year-end distribution checks. You can request direct deposit with American
Stock Transfer either on-line or by calling them at the phone number provided
on page 21.

Who do I notify of a change of address?

The transfer agent.

We go to Florida (Arizona) every winter. How do we get our mail from Petroleum
& Resources?

The transfer agent can program a seasonal address into its system; simply send
the temporary address and the dates you plan to be there to the transfer agent.

I want to give shares to my children, grandchildren, etc., as a gift. How do I
go about it?

Giving shares of Petroleum is simple and is handled through our transfer agent.
The stock transfer rules are clear and precise for most forms of transfer. They
will vary slightly depending on each transfer, so write to the transfer agent
stating the exact intent of your gift plans and the transfer agent will send
you the instructions and forms necessary to effect your transfer.

How do I transfer shares held at American Stock Transfer (AST)?

There are many circumstances that require the transfer of shares to new
registrations, e.g., marriage, death, a child reaching the age of maturity, or
giving shares as a gift. Each situation requires different forms of
documentation to support the transfer. You may obtain transfer instructions and
download the necessary forms from our transfer agent's website:
www.amstock.com. Click on Shareholder Services, then General Shareholder
Information and Transfer Instructions.

DIVIDEND PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Corporation presently pays dividends four times a year, as follows: (a)
three interim distributions on or about March 1, June 1, and September 1 and
(b) a "year-end" distribution, payable in late December, consisting of the
estimated balance of the net investment income for the year and the net
realized capital gain earned through October 31. Stockholders may elect to
receive the year-end distribution in stock or cash. In connection with this
distribution, all stockholders of record are sent a dividend announcement
notice and an election card in mid-November.

Stockholders holding shares in "street" or brokerage accounts may make their
elections by notifying their brokerage house representative.

Item  7.  Disclosure of Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures
for Closed-End Management Investment Companies.

PROXY VOTING GUIDELINES

Petroleum & Resources Corporation (Petroleum) follows  long-
standing  general  guidelines for the  voting  of  portfolio
company  proxies and takes very seriously its responsibility
to  vote all such proxies. The portfolio company proxies are
evaluated  by our research staff and voted by our  portfolio
management  team,  and  we annually  provide  the  Board  of
Directors with a report on how proxies were voted during the
previous year. We do not use an outside service to assist us
in voting our proxies.

As  an internally-managed investment company, Petroleum uses
its  own  staff of research analysts and portfolio managers.
In  making  the  decision to invest in  a  company  for  the
portfolio,  among the factors the research team analyses  is
the integrity and competency of the company's management. We
must be satisfied that the companies we invest in are run by
managers  with  integrity. Therefore, having evaluated  this
aspect  of  our  portfolio companies' managements,  we  give
significant  weight to the recommendations of the  company's
management in voting on proxy issues.

We vote proxies on a case-by-case basis according to what we
deem to be the best long-term interests of our shareholders.
The  key  over-riding principle in any proxy  vote  is  that
stockholders  be  treated  fairly  and  equitably   by   the
portfolio company's management. In general, on the  election
of  directors and on routine issues that we do  not  believe
present  the  possibility  of an  adverse  impact  upon  our
investment,  after  reviewing whether  applicable  corporate
governance   requirements  as   to   board   and   committee
composition  have been met, we will vote in accordance  with
the  recommendations  of the company's management.  When  we
believe that the management's recommendation is not  in  the
best  interests  of our stockholders, we will  vote  against
that recommendation.

Our general guidelines for when we will vote contrary to the
recommendation   of   the  portfolio  company   management's
recommendation are:

Stock Options

Our  general guideline is to vote against stock option plans
that we believe are unduly dilutive of our stock holdings in
the  company. We use a general guideline that we  will  vote
against  any  stock option plan that results in dilution  in
shares outstanding exceeding 4%. Most stock option plans are
established  to  motivate and retain key  employees  and  to
reward  them for their achievement. An analysis of  a  stock
option plan can not be made in a vacuum but must be made  in
the context of the company's overall compensation scheme. In
voting  on  stock  option plans, we  give  consideration  to
whether  the stock option plan is broad-based in the  number
of  employees who are eligible to receive grants  under  the
plan. We generally vote against plans that permit re-pricing
of  grants  or the issuance of options with exercise  prices
below the grant date value of the company's stock.

Corporate Control/Governance Issues

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests as a long-term shareholder in the company, we have
a long-standing policy of voting against proposals to create
a  staggered  board of directors. In conformance  with  that
policy,  we  will  generally vote in  favor  of  shareholder
proposals to eliminate the staggered election of directors.

Unless  we  conclude that the proposal is favorable  to  our
interests  as  a long-term shareholder in the  company,  our
general  policy is to vote against amendments to a company's
charter  that  can be characterized as blatant anti-takeover
provisions.

With  respect  to  so-called  golden  parachutes  and  other
severance packages, it is our general policy to vote against
proposals  relating  to  future  employment  contracts  that
provide  that  compensation will be paid  to  any  director,
officer  or  employee that is contingent upon  a  merger  or
acquisition of the company.

We generally vote for proposals to require that the majority
of a board of directors consist of independent directors and
vote  against proposals to establish a retirement  plan  for
non-employee directors.

We  have  found that most stockholder proposals relating  to
social  issues focus on very narrow issues that either  fall
within  the authority of the company's management, under the
oversight  of its board of directors, to manage the  day-to-
day  operations of the company or concern matters  that  are
more  appropriate for global solutions rather than  company-
specific ones. We consider these proposals on a case-by-case
basis  but  usually  are persuaded managements  position  is
reasonable   and   vote  in  accordance   with   managements
recommendation on these types of proposals.


Item   8.   Portfolio  Managers  of  Closed-End   Management
Investment Companies.

    (a) (1)  As of the date of this filing, Douglas G. Ober,
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Joseph  M.
Truta,  Executive  Vice President, and Robert  E.  Sullivan,
Executive  Vice  President, comprise the 3 person  portfolio
management team for the Registrant.  Mr. Ober and Mr.  Truta
have  served as portfolio managers for the Registrant  since
1991  and  Mr. Sullivan since 2008.  Mr. Sullivan served  as
Vice President-Research from April 2006 to January 2008  and
as  a research analyst from 2004 to April 2006.  Mr. Ober is
the  lead member of the portfolio management team.   Messrs.
Ober,  Truta and Sullivan receive investment recommendations
from  a team of research analysts and make decisions jointly
about  any equity transactions in the portfolio. Concurrence
of  the  portfolio  managers is required for  an  investment
recommendation to be approved.

    (2)   As  of the date of this filing, Mr. Ober  and  Mr.
Truta  also  serve  on  the portfolio  management  team  for
Registrant's  non-controlling affiliate, The  Adams  Express
Company (Adams), a registered investment company with  total
net  assets  of $840,012,143 as of December 31,  2008.   Mr.
Ober  is  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Adams  and
Mr. Truta is President.  The Registrant is a non-diversified
fund  focusing on  the energy and natural resources  sectors
and  Adams is a diversified fund with a different focus, and
there  are few material conflicts of interest that may arise
in  connection with these portfolio managers' management  of
both  funds.   The  funds do not buy or sell  securities  or
other   portfolio  holdings  to  or  from  the  other,   and
procedures and policies are in place covering the sharing of
expenses  and  the  allocation of investment  opportunities,
including  bunched orders and investments in initial  public
offerings, between the funds.

      (3)  The portfolio managers are compensated through  a
three-component  plan,  consisting of  salary,  annual  cash
incentive  compensation, and equity incentive  compensation.
The value of each component in any year is determined by the
Compensation  Committee,  comprised  solely  of  independent
director  members  of the Board of Directors  ("Committee").
The  Committee  has  periodically  employed  a  compensation
consultant to review the plan and its components.   Salaries
are  determined  by using appropriate industry  surveys  and
information  about  the  local market  as  well  as  general
inflation statistics.  Cash incentive compensation is  based
on  a combination of absolute and relative fund performance,
with  a  two-thirds  weighting, and  individual  success  at
meeting  goals and objectives set by the Board of  Directors
at  the  beginning of each year, with a one-third weighting.
Target  incentives are set annually based on 80%  of  salary
for  the  Chief Executive Officer and 60% of salary for  the
Executive  Vice  Presidents.  The fund performance  used  in
determining  cash  incentive compensation is  measured  over
both  a  one-year period, accounting for two-thirds  of  the
calculation, and a three-year period, which accounts for one-
third. The total return on net asset value of the Fund  over
each  of  the  two  periods  is used  to  determine  a  base
percentage  of target, which, for 2008, is then adjusted  by
performance  relative to a hypothetical portfolio  comprised
of  an  80/20 blend of the Dow Jones U.S. Oil and Gas  Index
and  the  S&P  500  Index ("Hypothetical Portfolio").  Using
these  calculations,  the  cash incentive  compensation  can
range  from  0%  to  a  maximum of 200% of  the  established
target.   Equity  incentive compensation, based  on  a  plan
approved  by  shareholders in 2005, can take several  forms.
Following  approval of the plan, grants of restricted  stock
were  made  to  the portfolio managers in April  2005,  with
vesting in equal proportions over a three year period.   The
size of the grants was determined by the Committee with  the
assistance of an outside compensation consultant.  Grants of
restricted  stock  were  also  made  on  January  10,  2008,
(previous  grants  had been made on January  11,  2007,  and
January  12, 2006), which vest three years after grant,  but
only upon the achievement of specified performance criteria.
For  the 2008 grants, the target number of restricted shares
will  vest  if,  on  the January 1 prior to  the  vest  date
("measurement date"), the Registrant's total three year  net
asset  value ("NAV") return meets or exceeds the three  year
total  NAV  return of a performance benchmark comprised  of,
for  year  2008, the Hypothetical Portfolio, and  for  years
2009  and  2010, a hypothetical portfolio consisting  of  an
80/20 blend of the Dow Jones U. S. Oil and Gas Index and the
Dow  Jones  U.  S. Basic Materials Index. Depending  on  the
level of Registrant's outperformance or underperformance  of
the  performance  benchmark  on  the  measurement  date,  an
additional  number  of shares, a lesser  percentage,  or  no
shares will be earned and vest.

    (4)   Using a valuation date of December 31,  2008,  Mr.
Ober  beneficially  owns  equity  securities  in  Registrant
valued  over $1,000,000.  Mr. Truta beneficially owns equity
securities   in  Registrant  valued  between  $500,001   and
$1,000,000.    Mr.   Sullivan   beneficially   owns   equity
securities  in  Registrant  valued  between  $100,001    and
$500,000.

   (b)  Not applicable.
