The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund Inc.'s investment objective is long-term
capital appreciation. To achieve its objective, the Fund invests in issuers that
are likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic, political,
structural and technological developments in the countries in the Caribbean
Basin, which include, among others, Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, the
Bahamas, the Dominican Republic, Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands
Antilles, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Belize,
Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, the United States and Venezuela ("Caribbean Basin
Countries"). The Fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in equity and
equity-linked securities of issuers, including U.S.-based companies which engage
in substantial trade with, and derive substantial revenue from, operations in
the Caribbean Basin Countries.

August 5, 2008

Dear Fellow Shareholders:

We are pleased to present our annual report for the period ended June 30, 2008.
On that date the Fund's net asset value was $7.31 per share, which represents a
loss of 13.12% for the one year period then ended (adjusted for distributions).
The Fund's share price closed the fiscal year at $7.69 per share, down from
$13.59 per share on June 30, 2007, and representing a 34.29% loss for the year
(adjusted for distributions). A year-end distribution of $1.28 per share was
paid in January 9, 2008, to shareholders of record December 12, 2007.

The first half of the calendar year was particularly challenging for both the
U.S. and most foreign markets. As of the date of this writing, however, both the
Fund's share price and net asset value have begun to recover, with particularly
strong gains on days when oil prices are lower.

There have been no greater headwinds in the region than the rapid appreciation
in crude oil prices. High oil prices affect nearly every industry in the
Caribbean, including shipping, tourism and infrastructure. Many of our largest
holdings, such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL), Carnival Corp. (CCL) and
Copa Holdings, S.A. (CPA) have been especially hurt as their costs have
increased as a result of rising oil prices. At current levels, we feel that much
of the high price of oil is already reflected in the valuation of these
companies, and any pullback in oil prices should benefit our portfolio.

In spite of the difficult market, the Fund traded at a premium to net asset
value most of the fiscal year, reflecting continued interest by investors.

Letter to Stockholders (Continued)
================================================================================

We continue to position the Fund's portfolio in companies we believe will
benefit from resumption of U.S. trade with Cuba and continue to monitor the
political situation in Cuba very closely. In February, Raul Castro was elected
President by the National Assembly, officially taking power from his brother
Fidel. Under Raul, the island nation has begun to show some changes. For
instance, Cubans are now allowed to stay in hotels, buy electronic products, own
cell phones, buy motorcycles and operate independent taxis. Additionally, the
government is considering changing the wage laws and reviewing the currency.
These developments could pave the way for further human rights advances.
Violations of human rights have been one of the primary arguments in favor of
keeping the U.S. Embargo against Cuba, and such positive developments, although
small steps, could lead to a reevaluation of U.S. policy.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Organization and Related Matters
- --------------------------------

The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") is a non-diversified,
closed-end management investment company incorporated under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January 1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The Fund's investment objective is to obtain long-term capital appreciation. The
Fund pursues its objective by investing primarily in equity and equity-linked
securities of public and private companies, including U.S.-based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country or (ii) that have at least 50% of the value of their assets in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country (collectively, "Caribbean Basin
Companies"). Under normal conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its total
assets in equity and equity-linked securities of Caribbean Basin Countries. This
80% policy may be changed without stockholder approval upon sixty days written
notice to stockholders. The Fund's investment objective is fundamental and may
not be changed without the approval of a majority of the Fund's outstanding
voting securities.

At June 30, 2008, the Fund had foreign investments in companies operating
principally in Mexico and the Cayman Islands representing approximately 26% and
7% of the Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is State Street Bank & Trust Company
("SSBT"), 200 Clarendon Street, PO Box 9130, Boston, Massachusetts 02117.

Security Valuation
- ------------------

Investments in securities traded on a national securities exchange (or reported
on the NASDAQ National Market or Capital Market) are stated at the last reported
sales price on the day of valuation (or at the NASDAQ official closing price);
other securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for
which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the last quoted bid price.
Restricted securities and other securities for which quotations are not readily
available are valued at fair value as determined by the Board of Directors.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements"
(SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Management is currently
evaluating the impact the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have on the Fund's
financial statements.

In February 2007, FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities -
including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115" (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159
permits entities to elect to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at
fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option
has been elected will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date.
SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that
begins after November 15, 2007. Management is currently evaluating the impact
the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have on the Fund's financial statements.

Income Recognition
- ------------------

Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Gains and losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost. Dividend income
is recognized on the ex-dividend date, or in the case of certain foreign
securities, as soon as the Fund is notified, and interest income is recognized
on an accrual basis. Pursuant to a custodian agreement, SSBT receives a fee
reduced by credits which are determined based on the average daily cash balance
the Fund maintains with SSBT. Credit balances used to reduce the Fund's
custodian fees for the year ended June 30, 2008 were approximately $2,362.
Discounts and premiums on debt securities purchased are amortized over the life
of the respective securities. It is the Fund's practice to include the portion
of realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments denominated in
foreign currencies as components of realized and unrealized gains and losses on
investments and foreign currency.

Deposits with Financial Institutions
- ------------------------------------

The Fund may, during the course of its operations, maintain account balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
- -----------------------------------------------------------

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Income Taxes
- ------------

The Fund's policy is to continue to comply with the provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code that are applicable to regulated investment companies and to
distribute all its taxable income to its stockholders. Under these provisions,
the Fund is not subject to federal income tax on its taxable income and no
federal tax provision is required.

The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

Distributions to Stockholders
- -----------------------------

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Income and
capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income tax
regulations which may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. For the year ended June 30, 2008, a distribution
from long-term capital gains of $1.223 per share and a net investment income
distribtuion of $0.057 per share was declared on November 26, 2007, payable on
January 9, 2008 to stockholders of record December 12, 2007. The distribution
was paid in stock, unless an election to receive cash was made by the
stockholder. Shares were issued at a reinvestment price of $7.94 per share,
which was equal to the net asset value of the common shares on the payable date
of the distribution, January 9, 2008.

NOTE 2. NON-MARKETABLE SECURITY OWNED

Investments in securities, at market value include $165,000 principal, 4.5%,
1977 Republic of Cuba bonds purchased for $63,038. The bonds were listed on the
New York Stock Exchange and had been trading in default since 1960. A
"regulatory halt" on trading was imposed by the New York Stock Exchange in July
1995 and trading in the bond was suspended as of December 28, 2006. The New York
Stock Exchange has stated that following the suspension of trading, application
will be made to the Securities and Exchange Commission to delist the issue. As
of June 30, 2008, the position was valued at $0 by the Board of Directors, which
approximates the bonds' fair value.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

Investments in securities also include 45,000 shares of Xcelera, Inc. The
security traded on the Pink Sheets until the first quarter of 2007 when trading
was discontinued. As of June 30, 2008, the position was valued at $0 by the
Board of Directors, which approximates the position's fair value.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

HERZFELD / CUBA (the "Advisor"), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors,
Inc., is the Fund's investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual
rate of 1.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Total fees for the year
ended June 30, 2008 amounted to $364,928, of which $106,107 is payable as of
June 30, 2008.

During the year ended June 30, 2008, the Fund paid $34,866 of brokerage
commissions to Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co., Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor, at
an average cost per share of $0.04.

A director of the Fund serves on the Board of Directors of Margo Caribe, Inc., a
company in which the Fund has an investment.

A director of the Fund is the owner of the Advisor and Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co.,
Inc.

The Fund reimbursed the Advisor in the amount of $21,080 for the portion of the
chief compliance officer's (the "CCO") salary determined to be attributable to
the services provided as CCO of the Fund.

NOTE 4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the year ended June 30, 2008, purchases and sales of investment
securities were $23,986,609 and $5,237,623, respectively.

At June 30, 2008, the Fund's investment portfolio had gross unrealized gains of
$3,552,023 and gross unrealized losses of $4,179,413, resulting in a net
unrealized loss of $627,390 for financial statement purposes.

NOTE 5. INCOME TAX INFORMATION

For financial statement purposes, the Fund's net investment income for the year
ended June 30, 2008 differs from the net investment income for tax purposes due
to the tax characterization of foreign currency income received by the Fund.
Realized gains differ for financial statement and tax purposes primarily due to
differing treatments of wash sales.

As of June 30, 2008, for tax purposes the Fund's undistributed net investment
income was $223,781 and its undistributed realized gain on investments was
$556,468.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

The cost basis of securities owned for financial statement purposes is lower
than the cost basis for income tax purposes by $55,717 due to wash sale
adjustments. As of June 30, 2008, gross unrealized gains were $3,496,306 and
gross unrealized losses were $4,179,413 for income tax purposes.

Permanent differences accounted for during the year ended June 30, 2008 result
from differences between book and tax accounting for foreign currency income.
Such amounts have been reclassified as follows:

                           Accumlated Net     Accumulated Net

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In June, 2006, FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes -- an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109"
("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes
recognized in accordance with FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." This interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides
guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2006, and was adopted by the Fund on July 1,
2007. The adoption had no effect on the Fund's financial statements.

NOTE 6. CAPITAL SHARE TRANSACTIONS

Rights Offering

On October 26, 2007, the Fund issued 1,812,293 common shares in connection with
a rights offering. Stockholders of record September 26, 2007 were issued one
non-transferable right for every share owned on that date. The rights entitled
the stockholders to purchase one new common share for every right held. In
addition, the Fund had the discretion to increase the number of shares of common
stock subject to subscription by up to 100% of the shares offered, or up to an
additional 1,678,556 additional shares of common stock.

Notes to Financial Statements
================================================================================

Year-End Distributions

On January 9, 2008, the Fund issued 213,222 common shares in connection with a
year-end distribution of $1.28 per share paid in stock. Stockholders were also
given the option of receiving the payment in cash. Shares were issued at $7.94
per share, equal to the net asset value of the Fund on the payable date of
January 9, 2008. New shares were issued at net asset value per share, therefore
the reinvestment of distributions had no effect on net asset value.

On January 12, 2007, the Fund issued 9,920 common shares in connection with the
2006 year-end distribution of $1.00 per share. The distribution was paid on
January 12, 2007 to shareholders of record December 15, 2006.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Board of Directors and Stockbrokers of
The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, of The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the
"Fund") as of June 30, 2008, and the related statement of operations for the
year then ended, the statement of changes in net assets for each of the two
years then ended, and financials highlights for each of three years in the
period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits. The financial highlights for each of the years in the two-year period
ended June 30, 2005 were audited by an independent registered public accounting
firm whose report dated July 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial highlights.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatements. The Fund
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
the internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statement. Our procedures included confirmation of securities
owned as of June 30, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The
Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. as of June 30, 2008, the results of the
operations for the year then ended, the changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
three years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

ITEM 7. DISCLOSURE OF PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLOSED-END
MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

A copy of the registrant's proxy voting policies and procedures as well as its
adviser's policies and procedures are attached hereto as Appendix A.

ITEM 8. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS OF CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANIES.

(a)(1) Thomas J. Herzfeld, Chairman and President of The Herzfeld Caribbean
Basin Fund, Inc. serves as the portfolio manager of the Fund and has held this
position since its inception in 1993. This information is as of August 29, 2008.

(a)(2)(i) and (ii) Mr. Herzfeld is also portfolio manager for approximately 46
other accounts comprising $48 million under management, and 0 pooled investment
vehicles comprising $0 under management, however, none of the these accounts are
managed with an investment strategy similar to the Fund's. The Fund is the only
investment company managed by Mr. Herzfeld; the Fund has total assets of
approximately $27 million.

(a)(2)(iii) No accounts are charged fees based on performance. For accounts
other than the Fund, fees are calculated as a percentage of the value of assets
under management at the end of each quarter.

(a)(2)(iv) The Fund does not believe that any material conflicts are likely to
arise through Mr. Herzfeld's management of other accounts in addition to the
Fund in that there is very little overlap in the type of investments made for
the Fund and other accounts, which generally trade shares of closed-end funds.
The Fund is permitted, to a limited extent, to buy shares of other closed-end
funds and occasionally other clients or Mr. Herzfeld may buy shares of
securities also held in the portfolio of the Fund. The advisor and the Fund have
adopted procedures overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer ("CCO") intended to
monitor compliance with such policies which include conflicts which may occur
regarding allocation of investment opportunities between the Fund and other
account. The CCO of the Fund reports directly to the Board of Directors at least
annually.

(3) Mr. Herzfeld receives no direct compensation from the Fund for his services
as Portfolio Manager. Mr. Herzfeld is 100% owner of the Advisor, a Subchapter S
Corporation, therefore he profits from the success of the Advisor and is taxed
on its profits.

(4)(a) Range of value of shares of the Fund owned by Mr. Herzfeld as of June 30,
2008: $100,001-$500,000.

(4)(b) Range of value of shares of the Fund owned by Mr. Herzfeld as of the date
of this filing: $100,001-$500,000.

                                   APPENDIX A
                     THE HERZFELD CARIBBEAN BASIN FUND, INC.
                       Proxy Voting Policy and Procedures

The Board of Directors of The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. (the "Fund")
hereby adopts the following policy and procedures with respect to voting proxies
relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund:

Policy

It is the policy of the Board of Directors of the Fund (the "Board") to delegate
the responsibility for voting proxies relating to portfolio securities held by
the Fund to the Fund's investment adviser (the "Adviser") as a part of the
Adviser's general management of the Fund, subject to the Board's continuing
oversight.' The voting of proxies is an integral part of the investment
management services that the Adviser provides pursuant to the advisory contract.

The Adviser may, but is not required to, delegate the responsibility for voting
proxies relating to portfolio securities held by the Fund to a sub-adviser
("Sub-Adviser") retained to provide investment advisory services, if applicable.
If such responsibility is delegated to a Sub-Adviser, then the Sub-Adviser shall
assume the fiduciary duty and reporting responsibilities of the Adviser under
these policy guidelines.

Fiduciary Duty

The right to vote a proxy with respect to portfolio securities held by the Fund
is an asset of the Fund. The Adviser, to which authority to vote on behalf of
the Fund is delegated, acts as a fiduciary of the Fund and must vote proxies in
a manner consistent with the best interest of the Fund and its shareholders.

Procedures

The following are the procedures adopted by the Board for the administration of
this policy:

A. Review of Adviser Proxy Voting Procedures. The Adviser with authority to vote
proxies on behalf of the Fund shall present to the Board its policies,
procedures and other guidelines for voting proxies at least annually, and must
notify the Board promptly of material changes to any of these documents.

B. Voting Record Reporting. No less than annually, the Adviser shall report to
the Board a record of each proxy voted with respect to portfolio securities of
the Fund during the year. With respect to those proxies that the Adviser has
identified as involving a conflict of interest(2), the Adviser shall submit a
separate report indicating the nature of the conflict of interest and how that
conflict was resolved with respect to the voting of the proxy.

Revocation

The delegation by the Board of the authority to vote proxies relating to
portfolio securities of the Fund is entirely voluntary and may be revoked by the
Board, in whole or in part, at any time.


<PAGE>

Annual Filing

The Fund shall file an annual report of each proxy voted with respect to its
portfolio securities during the twelve-month period ended June 30 on Form N-PX
not later than August 31 of each year.

Disclosures

The Fund shall include in its annual report to stockholders:

A description of this policy and of the policies and procedures used by the
Adviser to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio securities (3);
and

A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted proxies
relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period ended
June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund's
toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website(4).

The Fund shall also include in its annual and semi-annual reports to
stockholders:

A statement disclosing that a description of the policies and procedures used by
or on behalf of the Fund to determine how to vote proxies relating to portfolio
securities of the Funds is available without charge, upon request, by calling
the Fund's toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website.(5)

A statement disclosing that information regarding how the Fund voted proxies
relating to portfolio securities during the most recent 12-month period ended
June 30 is available without charge, upon request, by calling the Fund's
toll-free telephone number and on the SEC website.(6)

Review of Policy.

At least annually, the Board shall review this Policy to determine its
sufficiency and shall make and approve any changes that it deems necessary from
time to time


- ----------

(1)   This policy is adopted for the purpose of the disclosure requirements
      adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Release Nos. 33-8188,
      34-47304, IC-25922.

(2)   As it is used in this document, the term "conflict of interest" refers to
      a situation in which the Adviser or Sub-Adviser or affiliated persons of
      the Adviser or Sub-Adviser have a financial interest in a matter presented
      by a proxy other than the obligation it incurs as investment adviser to
      the Fund which compromises the Adviser's or Sub-Adviser's independence of
      judgment and action with respect to the voting of the proxy.

(3)   This disclosure shall be included in the annual report next filed by the
      Fund, on Form N-CSR on or after July 1, 2003.

                        THOMAS J. HERZFELD ADVISORS, INC.

                                  PROXY VOTING

                             POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

I. POLICY

Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, Inc. (the "Adviser") acts as discretionary
investment adviser for various clients, including The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin
Fund, Inc. an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, and clients governed by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA").

Selected clients, including The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. have elected
to have the Adviser vote proxies or act on the other shareholder actions on
their behalf, while other clients vote proxies themselves.

When voting proxies or acting on corporate actions for clients, the Adviser's
utmost concern is that all decisions be made in the best interest of its clients
(for ERISA accounts, plan beneficiaries and participants, in accordance with the
letter and spirit of ERISA). The Adviser will act in a manner deemed prudent and
diligent and which is intended to enhance the economic value of the assets of
its clients' accounts.

II. PURPOSE

The purpose of these Policies and Procedures is to memorialize the procedures
and policies adopted by the Adviser to enable it to comply with its
responsibilities and the requirements of Rule 206(4)-6 under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended ("Advisers Act"). These Policies and Procedures
also reflect the fiduciary standards and responsibilities set forth by the
Department of Labor for ERISA accounts.

III. PROCEDURES

Cecilia Gondor, Executive Vice President of the Adviser, is ultimately
responsible for ensuring that all proxies received by the Adviser are voted in a
timely manner and voted consistently across all portfolios. Although many proxy
proposals can be voted in accordance with the Adviser's established guidelines
(see Section V. below) (the "Guidelines"), the Adviser recognizes that some
proposals require special consideration, which may dictate that the Adviser
makes an exception to the Guidelines.

Cecilia Gondor is also responsible for ensuring that all corporate actions
received by the Adviser are addressed in a timely manner and consistent action
is taken across all portfolios.


<PAGE>

A. Conflicts of Interest. Where a proxy proposal raises a material conflict of
interest between the Adviser's interests and that of one or more its clients,
the Adviser shall resolve such conflict in the manner described below.

1. Vote in Accordance with the Guidelines. To the extent that the Adviser has
little or no discretion to deviate from the Guidelines with respect to the
proposal in question, the Adviser shall vote in accordance with such
pre-determined voting policy.

2. Obtain Consent of Clients. To the extent that the Adviser has discretion to
deviate from the Guidelines with respect to the proposal in question, the
Adviser shall disclose the conflict to the relevant clients and obtain their
consent to the proposed vote prior to voting the securities. The disclosure to
the clients will include sufficient detail regarding the matter to be voted on
and the nature of our conflict that the clients would be able to make an
informed decision regarding the vote. When a client does not respond to such a
conflict disclosure request or denies the request, the Adviser will abstain from
voting the securities held by that client's account.

B. Limitations. In certain circumstances, in accordance with a client's
investment advisory contract (or other written directive) or where the Adviser
has determined that it is in the client's best interest, the Adviser will not
vote proxies received. The following are some circumstances where the Adviser
will limit its role in voting proxies received on client securities:

1. Client Maintains Proxy Voting Authority: Where a client has not specifically
delegated the authority to vote proxies to the Adviser or that it has delegated
the right to vote proxies to a third party, the Adviser will not vote the
securities and will direct the relevant custodian to send the proxy material
directly to the client. If any proxy material is received by the Adviser, it
will promptly be forwarded to the client.

2. Terminated Account: Once a client account has been terminated with the
Adviser in accordance with its investment advisory agreement, the Adviser will
not vote any proxies received after the termination. However, the client may
specify in writing that proxies should be directed to the client for action.

3. Limited Value: If the Adviser concludes that the client's economic interest
or the value of the portfolio holding is indeterminable or insignificant, the
Adviser will abstain from voting a client's proxies. The Adviser does not vote
proxies received for securities which are no longer held by the client's
account. In addition, the Adviser generally does not vote securities where the
economic value of the securities in the client's account is less than $500.

4. Securities Lending Programs: When securities are out on loan, they are
transferred into the borrower's name and are voted by the borrower, in its
discretion. However, where the Adviser determines that a proxy vote (or
shareholder action) is materially important to the client's account, the Adviser
may recall the security.

5. Unjustifiable Costs: In certain circumstances, after doing a cost-benefit
analysis, the Adviser may abstain from voting where the cost of voting a
client's proxy would exceed any anticipated benefits of the proxy proposal.

IV. RECORD KEEPING

In accordance with Rule 204-2 under the Advisers Act, the Adviser will maintain
for the time periods set forth in the Rule (i) these proxy voting procedures and
policies, and amendments thereto; (ii) all proxy statements received regarding
client securities (provided however, that the Adviser may rely on the proxy
statement filed on EDGAR as its records)(1); (iii) a record of votes cast on
behalf of clients; (iv) records of client requests for proxy voting information;
(v) any documents prepared by the adviser that were material to making a
decision how to vote or that memorialized the basis for the decision; and (vi)
records relating to requests made to clients regarding conflicts of interest in
voting the proxy.


<PAGE>

The Adviser will describe in its Part II of Form ADV (or other brochure
fulfilling the requirement of Rule 204-3) its proxy voting policies and
procedures and advising clients how they may obtain information on how the
Adviser voted their securities. Clients may obtain information on how their
securities were voted or a copy of our Policies and Procedures by written
request addressed to the Adviser.

V. GUIDELINES

Each proxy issue will be considered individually. The following guidelines are a
partial list to be used in voting proposals contained in the proxy statements,
but will not be used as rigid rules.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Issues regarding the issuer's Board entrenchment and Oppose anti-takeover
measures such as the following:

b. Proposals to limit the ability of shareholders to call special meetings;

c. Proposals to require super majority votes;

d. Proposals requesting excessive increases in authorized common or preferred
shares where management provides no explanation for the use or need for these
additional shares;

e. Proposals regarding "poison pill" provisions; and

f. Permitting "green mail".

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1) Providing cumulative voting rights. Oppose

(2) "Social issues," unless specific client guidelines Oppose supersede, e.g.,
restrictions regarding South Africa.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(3) Election of directors recommended by management, Approve except if there is
a proxy fight.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) Election of auditors recommended by management, unless Approve seeking to
replace if there exists a dispute over policies.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(5) Date and place of annual meeting. Approve

(6) Limitation on charitable contributions or fees paid to Approve lawyers.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(7) Ratification of directors' actions on routine matters Approve since previous
annual meeting.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(8) Confidential voting Approve Approve

- ----------------

(1) Because the Adviser primarily invests its clients' assets in securities of
foreign issuers, the Adviser generally has not been receiving proxy statements
from such issuers because the laws of the countries in which these issuers are
domiciled respecting delivery of proxy statements to shareholders are different
than those of the U.S.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


<PAGE>

Confidential voting is most often proposed by shareholders as a means of
eliminating undue management pressure on shareholders regarding their vote on
proxy issues.

The Adviser will generally approve these proposals as shareholders can later
divulge their votes to management on a selective basis if a legitimate reason
arises.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(9) Limiting directors' liability Approve

(10) Eliminate preemptive right Approve

Preemptive rights give current shareholders the opportunity to maintain their
current percentage ownership through any subsequent equity offerings. These
provisions are no longer common in the U.S., and can restrict management's
ability to raise new capital.

The Adviser approves the elimination of preemptive rights, but will oppose the
elimination of limited preemptive rights, e.g., on proposed issues representing
more than an acceptable level of total dilution.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(11) Employee Stock Purchase Plan Approve
(12) Establish 401(k) Plan Approve
(13) Rotate annual meeting location/date Approve
(14) Establish a staggered Board Approve Approve
(15) Eliminate director mandatory retirement policy Case-by-Case (16) Option and
stock grants to management and directors Case-by-Case
(17) Allowing indemnification of directors and/or officers Case-by-Case after
reviewing the applicable laws and extent of protection requested.

                              EXHIBIT 99. CODE ETH.

                       HERZFELD CARIBBEAN BASIN FUND, INC.
          CODE OF ETHICS FOR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL OFFICERS

VI. Covered Officers/Purpose of the Code

This code of ethics (the "Code") for the Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc.
(the "Fund"), a closed-end investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 ("Investment Company Act"), applies to the Fund's Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (the "Covered Officers" each of
whom are set forth in Exhibit A) for the purpose of promoting:

o honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;

o full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that a registrant files with, or submits to, the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public communications made by the Fund;

o compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations;

o the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code to an appropriate
person or persons identified in the Code; and

o accountability for adherence to the Code.

Each Covered Officer should adhere to a high standard of business ethics and
should be sensitive to situations that may give rise to actual as well as
apparent conflicts of interest.

VII. Covered Officers Honest and Ethical Conduct and Ethically Handling Actual
and Apparent Conflicts of Interest

Overview. The Covered Officers shall conduct their activities on behalf of the
Fund in an honest and ethical manner. A "conflict of interest" occurs when a
Covered Officer's private interest interferes with the interests of, or his
service to, the Fund. For example, a conflict of interest would arise if a
Covered Officer, or a member of his family, receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his position with the Fund.

Certain conflicts of interest arise out of the relationships between Covered
Officers and the Fund and already are subject to conflict of interest provisions
in the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
("Investment Advisers Act"). For example, Covered Officers may not individually
engage in certain transactions (such as the purchase or sale of securities or
other property) with the Fund because of their status as "affiliated persons" of
the Fund. The Fund's and the investment adviser's compliance programs and
procedures are designed to prevent, or identify and correct, violations of these
provisions. This Code does not, and is not intended to, repeat or replace these
programs and procedures, and such conflicts fall outside of the parameters of
this Code.

Although typically not presenting an opportunity for improper personal benefit,
conflicts arise from, or as a result of, the contractual relationship between
the Fund and the investment adviser, of which the Covered Officers are also
officers or employees. As a result, this Code recognizes that the Covered
Officers will, in the normal course of their duties (whether formally for the
Fund or for the adviser, or for both), be involved in establishing policies and
implementing decisions that will have different effects on the adviser and the
Fund. The participation of the Covered Officers in such activities is inherent
in the contractual relationship between the Fund and the adviser and is
consistent with the performance by the Covered Officers of their duties as
officers of the Fund. Thus, if performed in conformity with the provisions of
the Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, such activities will
be deemed to have been handled ethically. In addition, it is recognized by the
Fund's Board of Directors ("Board") that the Covered Officers may also be
officers or employees of one or more other investment companies covered by this
or other codes.

Other conflicts of interest are covered by the Code, even if such conflicts of
interest are not subject to provisions in the Investment Company Act and the
Investment Advisers Act. The following list provides examples of conflicts of
interest under the Code, but Covered Officers should keep in mind that these
examples are not exhaustive. The overarching principle is that the personal
interest of a Covered Officer should not be placed improperly before the
interest of the Fund.

* * * *


<PAGE>

                         Each Covered Officer must not:

o use his personal influence or personal relationships improperly to influence
investment decisions or financial reporting by the Fund whereby the Covered
Officer would benefit personally to the detriment of the Fund;

o cause the Fund to take action, or fail to take action, for the individual
personal benefit of the Covered Officer rather than the benefit of the Fund; and

o use material non-public knowledge of portfolio transactions made or
contemplated for the Fund to trade personally or cause others to trade
personally in contemplation of the market effect of such transactions.

There are some conflict of interest situations that should be reviewed by the
Fund's legal counsel, if material. Examples of these include:

o service as a director on the board of any public or private company;

o receipt of gifts, in excess of reasonable or business-appropriate;

o the receipt of any entertainment from any company with which the Fund has
current or prospective business dealings unless such entertainment is
business-related, reasonable in cost, appropriate as to time and place, and not
so frequent as to raise any question of impropriety;

o any ownership interest in, or any consulting or employment relationship with,
any of the Fund's service providers, other than its investment adviser,
principal underwriter, administrator or any affiliated person thereof; and

o a direct or indirect financial interest in commissions, transaction charges or
spreads paid by the Fund for effecting portfolio transactions or for selling or
redeeming shares other than an interest arising from the Covered Officer's
employment, such as compensation or equity ownership.

VIII. Disclosure and Compliance

o Each Covered Officer should familiarize himself with the disclosure
requirements generally applicable to the Fund.

o Each Covered Officer should not knowingly misrepresent, or cause others to
misrepresent, facts about the Fund to others, whether within or outside the
Fund, including to the Fund's Board and independent auditor, and to government
regulators and self-regulatory organizations.

o Each Covered Officer should, to the extent appropriate within his area of
responsibility, consult with other officers and employees of the Fund and the
adviser with the goal of promoting full, fair, accurate, timely and
understandable disclosure in the reports and documents the Fund files with, or
submits to, the SEC and in other public communications made by the Fund.

o It is the responsibility of each Covered Officer to promote compliance with
the standards and restrictions imposed by applicable laws, rules and
regulations.

IX. Reporting and Accountability

                           Each Covered Officer must:

o upon adoption of the Code (or thereafter as applicable, upon becoming a
Covered Officer), affirm in writing to the Board that he has received, read, and
understands the Code;


<PAGE>

o annually affirm to the Board that he has complied with the requirements of the
Code and report on the Covered Officer's affiliations and relationships;

o not retaliate against any other Covered Officer or any employee of the Fund or
its affiliated persons for reports of potential violations that are made in good
faith; and

o notify the Fund's legal counsel promptly if he knows of any violation of the
Code. Failure to do so is itself a violation of the Code.

The Fund's legal counsel is responsible for applying the Code to specific
situations in which questions are presented under it and has the authority to
interpret the Code in any particular situation. However, any approvals or
waivers sought by a Covered Officer will be considered by the Independent
Directors on the Board.

The Fund will follow these procedures in investigating and enforcing the Code:

o the Fund legal counsel will take all appropriate action to investigate any
potential violations reported to such counsel;

o if, after such investigation, the Fund legal counsel believes that no
violation has occurred, such counsel is not required to take any further action;

o any matter that the Fund legal counsel believes is a violation will be
reported to the Board;

o the Board will consider appropriate action, which may include review of, and
appropriate modifications to, applicable policies and procedures; notification
to appropriate personnel of the investment adviser or its board; or a
recommendation to dismiss the Covered Officer;

o the Board will be responsible for granting waivers, as appropriate; and

o any changes to or waivers of the Code will, to the extent required, be
disclosed as provided by SEC rules.

X. Other Policies and Procedures

The Code shall be the sole code of ethics adopted by the Fund for purposes of
Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and forms applicable to
registered investment companies thereunder. Insofar as other policies or
procedures of the Fund, the Fund's adviser, principal underwriter, or other
service providers govern or purport to govern the behavior or activities of the
Covered Officers who are subject to the Code, they are superseded by the Code to
the extent that they overlap or conflict with the provisions of the Code. The
Fund's and its investment adviser's codes of ethics under Rule 17j-1 under the
Investment Company Act and the adviser's more detailed policies and procedures
are separate requirements applying to the Covered Officers and others, and are
not part of the Code.

XI. Amendments

Any amendments to the Code, other than amendments to Exhibit A, must be approved
or ratified by a majority vote of the Board, including a majority of independent
trustees.

XII. Confidentiality

All reports and records prepared or maintained pursuant to the Code will be
considered confidential and shall be maintained and protected accordingly.
Except as otherwise required by law or the Code, such matters shall not be
disclosed to anyone other than the appropriate Board, its legal counsel and the
adviser.

XIII. Internal Use

The Code is intended solely for the internal use by the Fund and does not
constitute an admission, by or on behalf of any Fund, as to any fact,
circumstance, or legal conclusion.
