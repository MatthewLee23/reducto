The Herzfeld  Caribbean Basin Fund's  investment  objective is long-term capital
appreciation.  To achieve its  objective,  the Fund  invests in issuers that are
likely, in the Advisor's view, to benefit from economic,  political,  structural
and  technological  developments in the countries in the Caribbean Basin,  which
consists of Cuba,  Jamaica,  Trinidad  and Tobago,  the Bahamas,  the  Dominican
Republic,  Barbados, Aruba, Haiti, the Netherlands Antilles, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, Mexico, Honduras,  Guatemala,  Belize, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia
and  Venezuela.  The fund  invests  at least 80% of its total  assets in a broad
range of securities of issuers including U.S.-based  companies,  which engage in
substantial  trade with and derive  substantial  revenue from  operations in the
Caribbean Basin Countries.

LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

August 12, 2003

Dear Fellow Stockholders:

We are pleased to present our annual  report for the period ended June 30, 2003.
On that date The Herzfeld  Caribbean Basin Fund's net assets were $6,626,004 and
its net asset  value per share was $3.95  after  payment  of a  distribution  of
$0.07746  per  share,  compared  with  $6,568,076,  or $3.92 per  share,  at the
beginning  of the  period.  This  represents  a gain of 3.19% in net asset value
after  adjustment for the  distribution  and an increase of 2.70% in share price
(after adjustment for the distribution) from $3.48 to $3.49 per share.

Calendar year 2003 is going quite well.  Year-to-date  (through August 12, 2003)
our net asset  value is up 26.90%  (unaudited)  while our share price has gained
17.17%  (unaudited).  Our net asset value was  favorably  impacted by the strong
recovery in the share prices of cruise line  stocks;  CARNIVAL  CORP.  (CCL) and
ROYAL  CARIBBEAN  CRUISES  LTD.  (RCL) are among our ten  largest  holdings  and
represented  4.96% and 4.89% of net  assets as of June 30,  2003,  respectively.
Most of our other major  holdings are also showing  good  performance  so far in
2003.  For  example,  FLORIDA  EAST COAST  INDUSTRIES  (FLA)  remains by far our
largest  position  representing  22.05% of our net  assets  at  fiscal  yearend.
Year-to-date FLA is up 29.57%,  hitting a new yearly high as of the date of this
letter at $30.22.

Since our  fiscal  year end,  we have added one new  company  to the  portfolio,
GARMIN LTD. (GRMN), a Cayman  Islands-incorporated  company which  manufactures,
markets and distributes Global Positioning Systems (GPS).

We added to our  position in MARGO  CARIBE,  INC.  (MRGO),  a Puerto  Rico-based
distributor  of  lawn  and  garden  products.  Shares  of  MRGO  are up  129.71%
year-to-date.

PREMIUM/DISCOUNT

As the graph below  depicts,  the Fund has traded at both premiums and discounts
every year except the year of inception in which it traded only at a premium. As
I have stated before,  we believe that closed-end  funds trading at discounts to
net asset value represent good value.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION AND RELATED MATTERS
- --------------------------------

The  Herzfeld  Caribbean  Basin  Fund,  Inc.  (the  Fund) is a  non-diversified,
closed-end  management  investment  company  incorporated  under the laws of the
State of Maryland on March 10, 1992, and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Fund commenced investing activities in January,  1994. The Fund
is listed on the NASDAQ SmallCap Market and trades under the symbol "CUBA".

The  Fund's  investment  policy  is to  invest  at least  80% of its  assets  in
investments that are economically tied to Caribbean Basin Countries.  The Fund's
investment  objective  is to obtain  long-term  capital  appreciation.  The Fund
pursues  its  objective  by  investing  primarily  in equity  and  equity-linked
securities of public and private companies, including U.S.- based companies, (i)
whose securities are traded principally on a stock exchange in a Caribbean Basin
Country  or (ii)  that  have at least  50% of the  value of  their  assets  in a
Caribbean Basin Country or (iii) that derive at least 50% of their total revenue
from operations in a Caribbean Basin Country. The Fund's investment objective is
fundamental  and may not be changed  without  the  approval of a majority of the
Fund's outstanding voting securities.

At June 30, 2003, the Fund had investments in companies operating principally in
Mexico,  and the Cayman Islands,  representing  approximately 16% and 10% of the
Fund's net assets, respectively.

The Fund's custodian and transfer agent is Investors Bank & Trust Company, based
in Boston, Massachusetts.

SECURITY VALUATION
- ------------------

Investments in securities traded on a national  securities exchange (or reported
on the NASDAQ  national  market) are stated at the last reported  sales price on
the day of valuation; other securities traded in the over-the-counter market and
listed  securities for which no sale was reported on that date are stated at the
last quoted bid price.  Short-term  notes are stated at amortized cost, which is
equivalent  to  value.  Restricted  securities  and other  securities  for which
quotations  are not readily  available are valued at fair value as determined by
the Board of Directors.

                                      -13-

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INCOME RECOGNITION
- ------------------

Security  transactions  are  recorded  on the trade  date.  Gains and  losses on
securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost.  Dividend income
is recognized on the exdividend  date,  and interest  income is recognized on an
accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on securities purchased are amortized over
the life of the respective securities.

DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
- ------------------------------------

The Fund may, during the course of its  operations,  maintain  account  balances
with financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits.

USE OF ESTIMATES IN THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- -----------------------------------------------------------

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted in the United States of America requires  management to make
estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of assets and
liabilities  and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the date of
the  financial  statements  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

INCOME TAXES
- ------------

The Fund  qualifies  as a  "regulated  investment  company"  and as such (and by
complying with the applicable  provisions of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended) is not subject to federal  income tax on taxable  income  (including
realized capital gains) that is distributed to shareholders.

The Fund has adopted a June 30 year-end for federal income tax purposes.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS
- -----------------------------

Distributions to stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend  date.  Income and
capital  gain  distributions  are  determined  in  accordance  with  income  tax
regulations which may differ from accounting  principles  generally  accepted in
the United States of America.

NOTE 2. NON-MARKETABLE SECURITY OWNED

Investment in securities include $165,000 principal, 4.5%, 1977 Republic of Cuba
bonds purchased for $63,038. The bonds are listed on the New York Stock Exchange
and had been trading in default since 1960. A  "regulatory  halt" on trading was
imposed by the New York Stock  Exchange in July,  1995. As of June 30, 2003, the
position  was valued at $0 by the Board of  Directors,  which  approximates  the
bonds' fair value.

NOTE 3. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

HERZFELD / CUBA (the Advisor), a division of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors,  Inc.,
is the Fund's investment advisor and charges a monthly fee at the annual rate of
1.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Total fees for the year ended June
30, 2003 amounted to $84,837.

During  the year  ended  June  30,  2003,  the Fund  paid  $1,380  of  brokerage
commissions to Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co., Inc., an affiliate of the Advisor.

NOTE 4. INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2003,  purchases  and sales of  investment
securities were $191,006 and $888,776, respectively.

$1,551,526  and  gross  unrealized  losses  of  $1,538,095,  resulting  in a net
unrealized gain of $13,431.

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
The Herzfeld Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,  including
the schedule of  investments,  of The Herzfeld  Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. as of
June 30, 2003, and the related  statement of operations for the year then ended,
the  statement  of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period
then  ended,  and the  financial  highlights  for each of the five  years in the
period then ended. These financial  statements and financial  highlights are the
responsibility  of the Fund's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  and financial  highlights  based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the  United  States of  America.  Those  standards  require  that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes  examining,  on a test  basis,  evidence  supporting  the  amounts  and
disclosures in the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures
include  confirmation of securities owned as of June 30, 2003, by correspondence
with the custodian and brokers.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as well as
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  the financial  statements and financial  highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material  respects,  the financial  position of The
Herzfeld  Caribbean Basin Fund, Inc. as of June 30, 2003, and the results of its
operations  for the year then  ended,  the changes in net assets for each of the
two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the
five years in the period then ended, in conformity  with  accounting  principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
